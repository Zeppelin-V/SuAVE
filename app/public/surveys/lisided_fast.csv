With many of these languages currently endangered or threatened, the creation of an enduring record of these language is of paramount importance. Endangered language documentation includes many elements, including raw audio and video recordings, photographs, transcription files, databases, files containing linguistic analysis and other research details, responses to experimental stimuli, and field observations. Together these files make up a collection of interlinked data for a particular project. For example, recordings go along with their transcriptions, and data in the transcriptions is added to databases. Managing all these kinds of data is necessary before archiving and making the data widely accessible. Researchers in the language sciences manage a large amount of interlinked data prior to depositing it in an archive. However, there are no guidelines for best practices for this type of collection and there are no standard tools for managing the files. As a result, current practices are inefficient and create bottlenecks that delay archiving. This project will use workshops to bring together stakeholders in language documentation, including software developers, to develop standardized software tools to address the hold-ups that have the potential to prevent research products from being properly archived and thus publicly accessible.<br/><br/><br/>The workshop series proposed here addresses this obstacle by developing standardized tools for management of linguistic data collections. Such tools will facilitate a more robust and reproducible science of language by providing researchers with standard methods to manage data from the point of collection to the point of archive deposit. The aim is to eliminate the collection management bottleneck and to facilitate greater uptake of language archives. The workshop series will bring together relevant stakeholders including: field linguists who collect data; theoretical linguists who make use of archival linguistic data; experts in data curation; and software developers. In order to encourage broad participation, the three workshops will be scheduled in conjunction with major gatherings of linguistic researchers, including the Linguistic Society of America annual meeting. The outcome of these workshops will be a sustainable plan for development of a cross-platform, open source collection management tool. By making data more accessible and better described this tool will facilitate increased reproducibility and accessibility of linguistic research. This greater availability of primary language resources will transform not only various subfields of linguistics, but also related fields such as anthropology and social psychology, which rely on careful management of field data. Further, by taking a stakeholder-driven approach via a series of workshops, the project has the potential to encourage broad adoption of collection management tools by both the language documentation community and by linguists representative of other subdisciplines. In doing so, the project will decrease the barriers to proper description and archiving of linguistic data of a wide variety. Moreover, by improving the dialogue between language documenters, language archivists, linguists and developers, this project will serve as a model for the development of software in linguistics, as well as other social and behavioral sciences.","maroon"

Burushaki is not known to be related to any other language in the world and is thus considered a linguistic ""isolate"". The database will consist of about 15-20 hours of high quality digitized audio and video recordings of Burushaski oral literature in different, significantly threatened, regional varieties, viz., Hunza, Nagar, and Yasin in Pakistan and Srinagar in India. The genres to be included are: traditional folktales and legends, historical accounts, personal narratives, formal speeches, conversations, poems, speaker-to-speaker discussions of data, and metadata. A selection of the materials will be provided with time-aligned transcriptions, multi-tier annotations, morpheme-to-morpheme and free translations into English. Keeping in view the level of literacy and second language proficiency among Burushaski speakers, a version of smaller edited texts will be independently transliterated into Burushaski and translated into Urdu. Transliteration in Burushaski will be done using a modified Perso-Arabic (Nastï¿½liq) script - a popular writing system for many of the languages spoken in the region. The materials will be archived in the following formats: audio in PCM wav, video in MPEG-2, texts downloadable in TXT, Word, and PDF format, ELAN files with translations and sound alignment, and XML (with XSL). Morphosyntactic analyses and lexical files will be maintained using FLEx - Fieldworks Language Explorer. <br/><br/>Since Burushaski is primarily preserved orally and literacy in the first language is practically non-existent, Dr. Munshi intends the text collection to be the springboard for pedagogical materials that will facilitate native language literacy. The pedagogical materials to be included in the Archive are: introduction to alphabet, wordlists, parts of speech, and basic grammar. The documentation materials will be archived at the University of North Texas Digital Collections Library.","maroon"

This increase has outpaced the existing organizational and preservation practices used by archives, especially where it is the repositories and their staff who organize long-term preservation and access for deposited collections. In 2011 the National Science Foundation issued a mandate that every researcher who applies for these federal research funds must submit a Data Management Plan to explain exactly how the collected research data would be stored, secured, preserved, and accessed. A 2013 memorandum from the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy specified that scientific research collected with federal funds must be made open and available for use by the public. These moves have overwhelmed the existing infrastructures for digital archives, especially those focusing on endangered languages. This project will investigate a potentially transformative methodology and set of best practices to solve this challenge that enables researchers in linguistics and language documentation to organize and curate their own data collections. If successful, results will be broadly useful to endangered language researchers as well as related disciplines like anthropology, sociology and the digital humanities. A transformation that facilitates the access and archiving of endangered language and other social science data would have a major positive impact on dissemination of data and further scholarship through re-use of the data. Exploring a solution that minimizes the financial impact while maximizing open access will offer a high value solution to a major challenge of the digital era.<br/><br/><br/>The Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (AILLA) is perfectly poised to carry out this project and confront the issue of the logjam of data. AILLA is the foremost example of a regional digital language archive whose holdings are both large and easily accessible. Founded in 2001 at the University of Texas at Austin, AILLA covers all of Latin America, home to several hundred endangered languages and the location of numerous language documentation projects, many funded by NSF and other federal agencies. With portals in both English and Spanish, AILLA holdings are accessible to a wider audience than those of English-portal-only archives. Project activities target a specific set of data collections, first to assess number and size of files and the level of organization for each individual deposit, and then to curate them. To gauge the extent of the data backlog facing the discipline on a wider scale, fellow member archives from the Digital Endangered Languages and Musics Archives Network (DELAMAN) will be surveyed regarding their workflows, repository organization, and types of backlogged collections. The information gleaned will be synthesized into a shared set of best practices, metadata, and methodologies, refined in consultation with DELAMAN archivists and disseminated through video tutorials on YouTube in both English and Spanish. The resulting training has the potential to enable digital archives staff to quickly and easily add new data collections to the digital repositories. Faster and easier ingestion of data into digital repositories will both streamline the ingestion processes at digital repositories as well as increase accessibility and discoverability of data to fulfill the open access mandate. Additionally, the project will co-convene a gathering of representatives DELAMAN archives in 2018 at the Institute on Collaborative Language Research (CoLang) to highlight newly developed methodologies and to facilitate connections between archivists and the researchers with unarchived data collections. Archivist and CoPI Susan Smythe Kung will also conduct a CoLang workshop to disseminate results and train researchers. Other deliverables include a presentation at the Linguistic Society of America, designed to reach a broad audience in the language sciences.","maroon"

Web archiving often runs into two opinions: (1) who cares about the past? and (2) hasn't the Internet Archive solved this already? While the Internet Archive is the cornerstone of web archiving, there remains much work to be done to align archiving with the larger web community. The PIs will investigate a collection of methods and concepts to accelerate the adoption and utility of web archives. While there are more than a dozen publicly available web archives (including the Internet Archive) that are simultaneously accessible via the Memento protocol, these archives are mostly underutilized because they lack the APIs and services to be of greater immediate use to the live web. For example, rather than returning ""HTTP 404"" responses for pages that are not archived, the archives can introspect on their collections for replacement or similar pages. This project will research: (1) extended APIs for archives; (2) models and methods for archival quality; and (3) user tools and techniques for exploring and understanding temporality on the web. The broader impacts of this research will include increasing the ability of archives to record today's social discourse, which primarily occurs on the web, oftentimes with print or TV as secondary. The ability to publish data on the web far outstrips the ability to archive it for posterity. There are a number of public web archives that are doing yeoman's work saving as much material as they can, but saving is only a precondition for later use. Mostly these archived web pages are being underutilized, only because the tools for extracting the value from these archives are lacking. This project will research and build the tools, infrastructure, and methods to better utilize, understand, and interact with the archived materials that we already have.<br/><br/>Aside from their crawling, archives are mostly passive collections of content that offer little in the way of services other than answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to a request for an archived page. Even with the increased rate of archiving (and a greater number of active web archives), there is little analysis on the web archives to provide better services for incoming requests. The PIs will build on their prior API work to explore recommendation services for web pages, where even if an archive does not have the requested web page it can make recommendations for a replacement page based on content and link analysis. This will prevent the web archives from being a dead end if they do not have the requested page. The PIs will also perform fundamental research on the issue of the quality of the reconstructed page, a topic that has been mostly ignored. In particular the PIs are concerned with detecting and resolving ""temporal violations,"" combinations of HTML pages with embedded resources that are presented to the user as an historical page but in fact they never existed in that combination on the live web. This occurs in at least 5% of the pages replayed through the Internet Archive. The other aspect of quality research deals with automatically assessing how damaged an archived page is with respect to its missing embedded resources. Straight percentages (e.g., this page is missing 3 of 57 embedded resources) do not tell the whole tale, but there are automated methods that can be used to estimate how important the resource was (even though you do not have it) to the rendered page. This will allow large-scale assessment not only of pages, but of archive-wide performance for comparable time periods. Lastly, the PIs will focus on tools and methods for allowing users to better understand and interact with the archived web and temporal concepts in general. Users' understanding of temporal concepts is not well advanced, in part because the tools are not in place to allow them to better understand and build models for interaction.

Anthropological archives document human diversity in the past and present. These data, which result from major private and public investments of time and resources, continue to be relevant to research today. They are used by scientists, citizens, and source community members to help answer questions that range from the communal to the global. However, this material is not being fully utilized because outdated and inappropriate archival descriptive practices make it impossible for researchers to locate and access collections. Despite increasingly robust online databases and search tools, valuable archival data remain hidden, often discovered only by chance. The research project funded by this award, led by Dr. Gabriela Pï¿½rez Bï¿½ez and Dr. Joshua A. Bell (National Anthropological Archives, Smithsonian Institution), will address this problem by investigating anthropological needs and data-gathering practices to inform improved standards for archiving anthropological materials. The project will improve understanding of the role of anthropological archives in preserving data, facilitate access and discovery in anthropological archives, and help ensure that this material is both available to and usable by future researchers. <br/><br/>The project will be carried out by a post-doctoral fellow based at the Smithsonian Institution's National Anthropological Archives (NAA). The NAA is the nation's largest anthropological archive and is an ideal location to carry out this research. As well as having extensive collections of different media from more than 130 anthropologists relating to some 2,000 cultures from around the globe, the NAA is contacted by hundreds of researchers each year, which provides a large study population. The fellow will be mentored by linguist Pï¿½rez Baez and cultural anthropologist Bell, with support from archivist Gina Rappaport. During this three-year project, the research team will survey archive users to determine who they are, how they obtain access to these collections, and what impediments limit their use of collections. Results from this survey will then feed into the implementation of new cataloguing terms and metadata fields that will ensure the discoverability of materials. An initial set of three case studies will be developed to test these cataloguing techniques. Working with scholars and communities who have vested interests in these materials, this work will be refined, and the ethics involved in making this material accessible explored. Because of the increase in ""born digital"" data, the research team will also explore how to effectively bridge archival digital and analogue gaps. Results will be disseminated through participation in professional conferences, a workshop at the Smithsonian, and publications. This grant will result in: 1) training of new archival leadership, 2) better access to anthropological data, and 3) development of a model that can be applied to anthropological archives throughout the United States. Ultimately, the goal is to facilitate better use of already-collected anthropological materials wherever they are housed, now and in the future.","maroon"

The archive will provide the capability to preserve and enable discovery of all products of NSF Arctic Science Section funded research, including data, metadata, software, documents, and provenance that link these in a coherent knowledge model, using infrastructure from the DataONE federation of data repositories.<br/><br/>This cooperative agreement will support a comprehensive archive of data from Arctic research funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences section, which necessitates a system that can handle the complexity, heterogeneity, and volume of data generated in the Arctic. By building upon successful repository infrastructures that already handle these kinds of data the repository will come online at project inception, be immediately useful to researchers, and undergo continuous improvement through feature expansions and refinement. Novel features in the archive will enable critical linkages between data, science, and policy. A data science fellowship program, training workshops, and a short course will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities for at least 190 graduate and undergraduate students. Selection will promote underrepresented groups with the goal to increase the diversity of data scientists in the research community. Students returning to their home universities will help communicate data science issues and will effect a large change across science disciplines nationally. In addition, the new infrastructure and data will have a lasting impact on Arctic research and policy globally. Arctic science has policy and societal importance that are disproportionally large, partly because of the impacts of climate change in the Arctic, and partly because of the resource implications on the oil, gas, and other industries that are affected by these changes. Digital research data will serve as a foundation for new insights that impact both science and society.<br/><br/>Data storage will be accomplished utilizing the UC Santa Barbara KNB Data Repository (KNB, formerly the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity) for its versioning and accessioning to enable an effective archive. Data will be replicated to administratively diverse institutions at the KNB, the Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) and the Amazon cloud, as this is critical to long-term preservation. DataONE researcher-facing tools will be adapted to provide convenient pathways to document and archive diverse data formats as part of scientists' normal workflow. This infrastructure will be supported with an outstanding set of community services, including data discovery tools, metadata assessment and editing, data cleansing and integration, data management consulting, and user help-desk services. A data recovery team will engage the community to prioritize and rescue critical Arctic data from past NSF research that is currently inaccessible. In addition to the traditional functions of a data archive, modern cloud-based data facilities will support detailed provenance tracking of the science process, data usage and citation reporting, linkages among heterogeneous disciplines, and direct linkages between the literature, investigators, and funding programs. Usability and outreach specialists will engage an interdisciplinary Arctic Science Advisory Board and the broader polar science communities to drive continuous improvement by evaluating tools and services, gathering requirements and use cases, and prioritizing improvements to infrastructure and service offerings of the archive. Usage data and usability studies will drive an iterative cycle of assessment and development to improve operations.","plum"

Since the late 1950's, human activity in the MDV has become commonplace in summer, putting pressure on the region's fragile ecosystems through camp construction and inhabitation, cross-valley transport on foot and via vehicles, and scientific research that involves sampling and deployment of instruments. Historical photographs, put alongside information from written documentation, offer an invaluable record of the changing patterns of human activity in the MDV. Photographic images often show the physical extent of field camps and research sites, the activities that were taking place, and the environmental protection measures that were being followed. Historical photographs of the MDV, however, are scattered in different places around the world, often in private collections, and there is a real danger that many of these photos may be lost, along with the information they contain. This project will collect and digitize historical photographs of sites of human activity in the MDV from archives and private collections in the United States, New Zealand, and organize them both chronologically and spatially in a GIS database. Sites of past human activities will be re-photographed to provide comparisons with the present, and re-photography will assist in providing spatial data for historical photographs without obvious location information. The results of this analysis will support effective environmental management into the future. The digital photo archive will be openly available through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) website (www.mcmlter.org), where it can be used by scientists, environmental managers, and others interested in the region. <br/><br/>The central question of this project can be reformulated as a hypothesis: Despite an overall increase in human activities in the MDV, the spatial range of these activities has become more confined over time as a result of an increased awareness of ecosystem fragility and efforts to manage the region. To address this hypothesis, the project will define the spatial distribution and temporal frequency of human activity in the MDV. Photographs and reports will be collected from archives with polar collections such as the National Archives of New Zealand in Wellington and Christchurch and the Byrd Polar Research Center in Ohio. Private photograph collections will be accessed through personal connections, social media, advertisements in periodicals such as The Polar Times, and other means. Re-photography in the field will follow established techniques and will create benchmarks for future research projects. The spatial data will be stored in an ArcGIS database for analysis and quantification of the human footprint over time in the MDV. The improved understanding of changing patterns of human activity in the MDV provided by this historical photo archive will provide three major contributions: 1) a fundamentally important historic accounting of human activity to support current environmental management of the MDV; 2) defining the location and type of human activity will be of immediate benefit in two important ways: a) places to avoid for scientists interested in sampling pristine landscapes, and, b) targets of opportunity for scientists investigating the long-term environmental legacy of human activity; and 3) this research will make an innovative contribution to knowledge of the environmental history of the MDV.","plum"

It addresses needs of those interested in emergency preparedness/response, digital government, and the social sciences. It proves the effectiveness of the 5S (Societies, Scenarios, Spaces, Structures, Streams) approach to intelligent information systems by crawling and archiving events of broad interest. It leverages and extends the capabilities of the Internet Archive to develop spontaneous event collections that can be permanently archived as well as searched and accessed, and of the LucidWorks Big Data software that supports scalable indexing, analyzing, and accessing of very large collections. Through a new model-based approach to intelligent focused crawling, it improves the quality (e.g., accuracy, coverage, and elimination of noise) of collections of webpages so as to ensure comprehensiveness, balance, and low bias, as is needed for scholarly study of historically important events by social scientists. It incorporates a range of visualization capabilities in support of key stakeholder communities, including archivists, librarians, researchers, scholars, and the general public. IDEAL connects the processing of tweets and webpages, combining informal and formal media, to automatically detect important events, as well as to support building collections on chosen general or specific topics. It supports integration of multiple types and at multiple levels, including key models about the event it is crawling (event models), the sources of information about the event (source models), the mechanisms used for disseminating information about the event (publishing venue models), and the entities related to the event (society /organization models). Integrated services include topic identification, categorization (building upon special ontologies being devised), sentiment analysis, and visualization of data, information, and context.<br/><br/>The IDEAL website (http://www.eventsarchive.org) supports searching, browsing, analyzing, and visualizing of event collections (of both tweets and webpages), as well as access to project software, methods, findings, publications, and other results. Usage is encouraged of the integrated system along with a growing number of collections, as well as of particular tools such as for focused crawling, which should aid curators to avoid non-relevant content while including a broader range of sources, improving significantly upon current crawling and archiving methods. Important data and information on events of interest are saved rather than lost, helping preserve our history and culture, in support of public interest, education, policy making, historical analyses, and comparative studies. Students studying sociology, human-computer interaction, digital libraries, information retrieval, computational linguistics, multimedia, and hypertext are gaining experience and contributing in scholarly studies, algorithms, software, interfaces, and big data handling.","indigo"

That knowledge is communicated and preserved through publication in scientific journals that use peer review to judge the merit of the research conducted. There has been increased interest by scientists and the public to understand how this knowledge production process works in practice. Using the methods of science to explore this important social process can make its workings more transparent without undermining the confidentiality that is necessary to peer review. Yet there are few known repositories of documents needed for such scientific study. Because such repositories of documents are rare and generally not available for study, scholars have been unable to fully study the production of scientific knowledge because they only have the research that was published; yet for premier scientific journals only a subset (often as little as 10 to 15 percent) of the works submitted actually appear in journal pages. Why others were not, and what the reviewers? comments and editorial changes were for those that were published is invisible. <br/><br/>The ASA proposes to undertake a three-year project in collaboration with the Center for Social Science Research at the George Mason University to develop a digital research archive from 20 years of preserved records made available for scholarly research. The archive will contain a database that includes the digitized manuscripts submitted, the reviews, and the decisions made from 1991 to 2009. Since the early 20th century, the American Sociological Association (ASA) has been a major scholarly publisher in the United States, reviewing, disseminating and preserving sociological knowledge through its eight major scholarly journals. Prior to 1991, like most publishers, ASA destroyed all the journal file documents after publication. For the historically significant period 1991 to 2009, however, ASA retained and stored the original paper copies of all manuscripts submitted for review by its eight premier journals as well as the peer reviews and records of editorial decisions made during this period. The creation of this archive involves scanning paper documents, creating a digital architecture and hierarchical data base for researchers to use, securing permission from authors and reviewers to include their documents in the archive, building a hierarchical data set of manuscripts, authors, and reviewers that is searchable, and fully documenting the archived data set so that researchers can use it. The final product will be one of the most comprehensive data products for evaluating the scientific publishing process from initial submission to final publication.","crimson"

This proposal is a request for a modest one-year grant to implement the transition of CLEA to a new organizational model. Currently containing results at the electoral district level of 1,494 elections from 129 countries, this archive helps a sizeable community of active scholars and policy practitioners who produce research and findings with important real-world implications. Users of the data work in areas such as formulating better policies, designing institutions, and allocating development assistance. For example, this sort of knowledge is essential to government agencies (both domestic and foreign) when they engage with new and emerging democracies. These users have a stake in the long-term preservation and improvement of the data. The grant enables the PIs to design and install a new structure of governance (with bylaws); develop an appropriate strategic plan for long-term funding; and augment the archive to a point where it is in the best possible shape when the transition occurs, by expanding the contents of the archive with an eye toward maximizing its global and historical coverage.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>By providing extensive, high-quality sub-national data on election results, CLEA helps increase the breadth and sophistication of political science research, creates opportunities for novel interdisciplinary inquiry, and facilitates the use of cutting-edge spatial analytical tools. The result is better, richer insights with improved validity. CLEA has recently added new products: geo-coded information on constituencies and summary data on parties and elections. During the grant year, the co-PIs will oversee the formatting (in the process making choices about addressing the diversity of electoral systems worldwide), cleaning, and posting of new elections data, with the aim of maximizing the global and temporal coverage of the archive, (2) make strategic decisions about expanding CLEA, including the geocoding of constituency boundaries, (3) establish links with other social scientific infrastructure projects, including cross-national datasets with social, economic, and political variables that could be matched up to CLEA data at the constituency level, and (4) improve the functionality of the website.","crimson"

Since the late 1950's, human activity in the MDV has become commonplace in summer, putting pressure on the region's fragile ecosystems through camp construction and inhabitation, cross-valley transport on foot and via vehicles, and scientific research that involves sampling and deployment of instruments. Historical photographs, put alongside information from written documentation, offer an invaluable record of the changing patterns of human activity in the MDV. Photographic images often show the physical extent of field camps and research sites, the activities that were taking place, and the environmental protection measures that were being followed. Historical photographs of the MDV, however, are scattered in different places around the world, often in private collections, and there is a real danger that many of these photos may be lost, along with the information they contain. This project will collect and digitize historical photographs of sites of human activity in the MDV from archives and private collections in the United States, New Zealand, and organize them both chronologically and spatially in a GIS database. Sites of past human activities will be re-photographed to provide comparisons with the present, and re-photography will assist in providing spatial data for historical photographs without obvious location information. The results of this analysis will support effective environmental management into the future. The digital photo archive will be openly available through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) website (www.mcmlter.org), where it can be used by scientists, environmental managers, and others interested in the region. <br/><br/>The central question of this project can be reformulated as a hypothesis: Despite an overall increase in human activities in the MDV, the spatial range of these activities has become more confined over time as a result of an increased awareness of ecosystem fragility and efforts to manage the region. To address this hypothesis, the project will define the spatial distribution and temporal frequency of human activity in the MDV. Photographs and reports will be collected from archives with polar collections such as the National Archives of New Zealand in Wellington and Christchurch and the Byrd Polar Research Center in Ohio. Private photograph collections will be accessed through personal connections, social media, advertisements in periodicals such as The Polar Times, and other means. Re-photography in the field will follow established techniques and will create benchmarks for future research projects. The spatial data will be stored in an ArcGIS database for analysis and quantification of the human footprint over time in the MDV. The improved understanding of changing patterns of human activity in the MDV provided by this historical photo archive will provide three major contributions: 1) a fundamentally important historic accounting of human activity to support current environmental management of the MDV; 2) defining the location and type of human activity will be of immediate benefit in two important ways: a) places to avoid for scientists interested in sampling pristine landscapes, and, b) targets of opportunity for scientists investigating the long-term environmental legacy of human activity; and 3) this research will make an innovative contribution to knowledge of the environmental history of the MDV.","plum"

Currently, this deep archive data is only available via NOAA personnel retrieving data by hand from tape storage, thus preventing machine discovery or easy data recovery by science community members, and placing the data itself at risk through the requirement for higher level of data maintenance at a time of reduced resources at NOAA. This proposal would thus ?shore up? the DSDP, ODP, and IODP deep archive, and make the data also available for innovative community efforts to make discoverable data sets that merge Expedition and post-Expedition data sets.<br/><br/>This work is relatively straightforward but essential for making the deep archive of the DSDP, ODP and IODP available through the World-Wide Web for modern data discovery methods. The proposal applies tools developed at the NOAA NCEI to transfer the data off of tape files unconnected to the web to the NCEI Extract system (NEXT), adding metadata about the data to the NEXT catalog. The work will be done by University of Colorado staff that serve as NCEI software developers and managers, working with NCEI Federal staff. This work will thus modernize the DSDP, ODP, and IODP deep archive, helping to ensure both its continued existence and improve its relevance and value to many thousands of geoscientists worldwide.","lavender"

The PDB is a key research resource that is essential for our understanding of living systems. It serves a broad community of experimental, structural, and computational scientists, and educators at all levels. PDB access is provided through primary web and ftp sites (www.pdb.org, ftp.pdb.org) or via multiple mirror sites distributed worldwide. The PDB will be managed by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology (RCSB), consisting of a partnership between Rutgers, the University of California San Diego and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography to provide a single, searchable archive of accurate and well-annotated data on experimentally determined macromolecular structure. Systems developed by RCSB are currently being used for data processing, archiving, distribution and query, as well as maintenance of the physical archive. In addition to continued operation of the primary data archiving, ingestion, and dissemination functions, the project will implement several enhancements to the infrastructure associated with the two main operational functions of the archive: data ingestion and processing, and data dissemination. Improvements include provision of a robust, high-throughput pipeline to manage ongoing increases in the volume and complexity of data submitted to PDB, development of query, analysis, visualization, and reporting tools to enhance access to PDB data, and develop a range of education and outreach activities that support the use of PDB data by teachers and students at all educational stages. The result of this effort will be a significant improvement in the utility and value of the Protein Data Bank for both specialists and non-specialists alike. <br/><br/>Mechanisms for increasing the broader impacts of this work include the following: a series of workshops and meeting sessions, active participation in scientific meetings, a regular newsletter, the on-going use of a help desk to increase the access and utility of PDB for the specialist and non-specialist research community, and use of focus groups to insure maximum usability of PDB data. Participation in graduate and undergraduate coursework design and implementation and in structured research opportunities is being used to increase the impact of PDB on university-level education. Participation in teacher training workshops and a collaborative effort to launch a teacher development program provide opportunities to bring PDB resources to the K/12 environment. The general public is being made aware of PDB efforts through a traveling art exhibit and through frequent news releases and informational programs. Online-based activities like the ?Structural View of Biology? and ?Molecule of the Month? will reach audiences nationally and globally. New activities to be introduced under the current award include increased outreach to under-represented communities and the development of annual theme topics to provide a focus for national integration of education activities involving structural biology. Collectively, these efforts will extend the benefits of PDB resources and activities to the broadest possible community.","puce"

After deduplication, the structure of an inverted index for versioned data becomes complex and it is expensive to search relevant results. This project will study low-cost solutions for compact archiving and indexing and develop efficient algorithms and systems techniques for searching versioned datasets. It will also consider that the archived data can be stored in an untrusted server environment and investigate tradeoffs in efficiency and privacy-preservation for search.

Historic data from the IVM have contributed to major advances in understanding the photospheric vector magnetic fields of active regions on the Sun. The main goal is to advance those data-processing codes of IVM data, so that the released archive of IVM data is of as high quality as possible for use by the broad solar community. Upon completion of this project, the available IVM data archive will be treated consistently, and it will ready for scientific analysis. This research project will contribute to improved community knowledge on handling imaging spectro-polarimetric data, which will have an impact on analyzing data from the future DKIST (formerly known as the ATST). The project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>A consistently produced archive of IVM data presents a unique data source for studying the long-term behavior of the Sun, since it allows for inversion-independent determination of magnetic field strengths in sunspots over 1.5 solar cycles. The IVM data have featured prominently in novel investigations of solar flares and their prediction --- a topic with societal impacts that range from communications disruptions to power-grid outages. The IVM data would contribute to the large statistical samples needed for further progress, complementing present data from SDO/HMI. Predicting solar flares, and quantitatively understanding the inter-cycle behavior of our Sun, are questions with potentially major impacts on today's society.","fuchsia"

The investigator will use quantitative analyses, archival research, and oral history interviews to track and describe the behavior of hundreds of actors. The study will make a significant contribution to the history of biological science, as well as to the understanding of scientific collaboration, disciplinarity, and interdisciplinarity. It provide a novel framework for addressing such questions as the division of epistemic labor and authority between humanities and natural science disciplines, as well as questions about the motives, institutional supports, mechanics, effects, and appraisal of interdisciplinary research. Outcomes include two publically accessible archives: an electronic archive of raw and processed data and select archival materials, to be stored at an online repository at Arizona State University, and an archive of oral history interviews with some of the most influential biologists and philosophers of biology of the twentieth century, to be stored at the American Philosophical Society. In addition, the project will produce a series of papers in academic journals that will contribute to ongoing and widespread discussions and policy evaluations of interdisciplinarity. Finally, it will produce a book written for a broad audience showing how researchers in the humanities have effectively collaborated with those in the exact sciences with mutually beneficial results that impact both fields.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>From the 1950s to the present day, professional biologists and professional philosophers have often worked together to address questions about the anthropological and sociological reach of biological models, the relation of evolutionary and organismic explanations and perspectives to molecular and physical ones, and the interpretation of such contested concepts as ""species,"" ""gene,"" ""fitness,"" ""race,"" ""biological function,"" and ""ecological diversity."" These collaborations helped shape the field today known as ""philosophy of biology."" The project promises to shed new light on the history of both biology and the philosophy of biology in the late twentieth-century. It also makes a contribution to contemporary research on interdisciplinary collaborations. Biological science has raised and confronted fundamental questions throughout its modern history. By providing a detailed historically and theoretically informed study of how researchers from the prima facie quite different disciplinary backgrounds of biology and philosophy addressed these questions during the period in question, both separately and in dialogue and collaboration, the project helps us to see biology and its implications for intellectual life and culture in a new way.","crimson"

These larger biological systems play key roles in basic molecular biology, photosynthesis, nanotechnology, and health. Rather than relying on a single technique, the three dimensional structures of these molecular machines are being determined by integrating results from many different kinds of experiments using computational methods. In order to allow these integrative, or hybrid, models to enable future research by the broad community of scientists and also provide for the development of new educational platforms, it is essential to develop a way to archive these data and make them easily accessible. <br/><br/>Several steps are necessary to achieve this goal. Current archiving of macromolecular structures depends on the fixed spatial positions of atoms; therefore the existing representation of these models must be extended to include both non-atomistic and spatio-temporal models. A new infrastructure will be developed that allows for the federation of different experimental repositories hosting data sets contributing to these integrative models. Once this infrastructure is developed, it will be necessary to prototype a system for depositing and archiving these new integrative models and supporting data.","puce"

Dr. Kaufman is one of the world's foremost Mesoamericanists. His career spans more than fifty years. His research includes most of the language families in a region of great linguistic, cultural, historical, and archaeological importance. Kaufman's vast language documentation work has made important contributions to linguistics as well as to other disciplines. The core of his contribution is the historical reconstruction of proto-languages - the ancestors of modern languages - including Mayan, Mixe-Zoquean, and Uto-Aztecan. This research sheds light on interactions among peoples and the transmission of ideas as well as artifacts. Kaufman and his collaborators have made major contributions to the understanding of the pre-history of Mesoamerican societies.<br/><br/>The collection includes over 100,000 pages of manuscript; 900 CDs of original recordings; 100 boxes of file slips; and 200 digital texts and databases. These materials will be digitized, converted to standard formats, and preserved in AILLA. The collection and the catalog will be available through English and Spanish web-based interfaces. Grammars, dictionaries, and collections of texts can be repurposed for language teaching at all levels. Revitalization efforts are underway for dozens of the languages documented in this collection; these materials will be a treasure trove for such efforts. Kaufman has always promoted the participation of speakers in all aspects of language documentation. He devised practical orthographies for most of the languages of Mesoamerica that make transcriptions and other data easier for non-specialists to use. Many native-speaker graduates of his projects are now teachers, researchers, or directors of institutes who can make immediate use of the resources that will be made available through this project.","maroon"

However, a global crisis is looming, with an unprecedented number of the world's languages estimated to disappear before century's end. As languages fall silent when there are no remaining fluent first language speakers, they will take with them a unique entry into understanding the capabilities of the human mind. In addition, the loss of languages will end the opportunity to gain insight into local knowledge of the places where they were spoken, as well as the human history and prehistory of those who spoke them. Nearly one third of the world's six to seven thousand languages are threatened due to the internal pressures of multilingualism. Multilingualism is the use of two or more languages, either by a community or by an individual. Linguists have responded to the challenge of language endangerment by attempting to undertake rich multimedia documentation of such languages before they disappear. However, in many places where multilingualism is common, the languages are under-documented because of insufficient infrastructure and training. This workshop will offer training for documenting languages in these contexts. Such training is necessary for three important reasons. First, it will fill the scholarly gaps for languages with little or no documentation. Second, documentation of these languages will increase the scientific understanding of the interaction between multilingualism and language endangerment. Third, it offers scientists the opportunity to contribute to the creation of a record of threatened human languages. Broader impacts in this project include the facilitation of new international collaborations, the training of a new generation of language documenters in a diverse linguistic region, and opportunities for international research experience for graduate students and junior researchers.<br/><br/>This workshop will convene with its focus on endangered African languages, which are distributed over diverse multilingual environments. This workshop aims to address this situation through the transfer of skills and the training of West African and American graduate students and junior researchers in state-of-the-art techniques of language documentation and data management. The workshop, which will be held at the University of Education in Winneba, Ghana, will be staffed by an international cohort of experts in documentary linguistics from the United States, Europe and Africa. Participants will have access to an international network of researchers in endangered language documentation. This workshop integrates theory and technique with actual practice in language documentation. Instructors and students will be involved in hands-on data collection with five speakers of Animere, a highly endangered language spoken in the Ghana-Togo border area, to create a first documentation of the language. Audio and video documentation of Animere will be archived at the established Archive of Language and Oral Resources of Africa (ALORA) housed at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, and at the University of Florida's Language Archive (TUFLA), a new language archive, in order to make it widely accessible to researchers and the public.","maroon"

While missionaries, anthropologists, and linguists have recorded valuable information about Chiwere over the past 150 years, Chiwere lacks essential documentation, and no fluent speakers remain to contribute new data. The Chiwere Audio Archive Project (CAAP) will give linguists, Indian communities, and the general public access to audio recordings and texts from a collection of Chiwere oral literature told by the last fluent speakers. Since the collection was made during the 1960s-1990s using fragile cassette tapes and reel-to-reels, the project will convert these analogue recordings to digital files. Project personnel will then transcribe the recordings in Chiwere, translate them into English, and annotate them with linguistic, historical, and cultural information. Finally, the recordings and texts will be made available online and distributed to archives and stakeholder tribes.<br/><br/>Chiwere is a heritage language for three federally recognized Indian tribes in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. CAAP benefits these communities by providing resources to support their language revitalization goals. While no fluent speakers remain, a few individuals learned to speak and understand Chiwere from their relatives, and the language is still used in certain settings today. Many tribal members want to learn more of their traditional language from the voices of their elders, but there are few audio-based pedagogical materials to meet this need. CAAP will remedy this situation by giving Native communities access to recordings and texts of traditional stories, oral histories, and songs. CAAP will also employ tribal members as project assistants and train them to become language curators in their communities. In addition to benefiting tribal members, CAAP also benefits linguists. Chiwere is less understood than many Siouan languages, especially others in the Mississippi Valley subfamily. CAAP facilitates further research on Chiwere grammar and comparative Siouan topics and will be of broad interest to linguists. Overall, CAAP will meet the needs of linguists, tribal stakeholders, and the general public by preserving and making available Chiwere recordings and texts with irreplaceable linguistic and cultural significance.","maroon"

Existing comparative research on textual practices focuses on alphabetic writing systems such as English, which represent individual speech sounds in sequence. The research has tended to be empirically weaker in its consideration of the world's vast array of non-alphabetic systems such as pictographic and pictographically-inclined systems, which draw on the visual resemblance of written characters to things. Investigating written texts as material, visual media will deepen our understanding of how writing and reading shape social relationships, particularly within societies that use (or once used) non-alphabetic writing. Given the increasing role of visually-rich texts in digital media throughout the world, research findings should be especially important to understanding visual design in its broadest sense, with implications for visual design practices in the U.S. and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Through 15 months of ethnographic and archival research, Katherine Dimmery, under the supervision of Dr. Erik Mueggler of the University of Michigan, will explore whether human/material engagements can be shown to be inherently social, sharing many of the structural features of face-to-face interactions, such as having dialogic emergent qualities. Semiotic approaches to materiality have tended to analyze how materials condition human forms of sociality. To test whether this theoretical assumption holds, the project looks textual practices among the Naxi, a Tibeto-Burman ethnic minority of rural southwest China known for their pictographic writing system. The Naxi writing system (and the endangered language it documents) is important for analyzing textual practice because unlike Western writing systems build connections between orthography and speech to signify symbolically, this pictographic system establishes reference based on visual similarity (or iconicity) between orthographic elements and physical objects. Focusing on the ongoing shift of this writing towards phonetic representation of speech, the project aims to understand (1) how Naxi textual practices have been transmitted across China's ""Great Divide"" and into the present; (2) how increasing Western and Chinese presence in the southwest during that period contributed to phoneticization, and (3) how these changes pose problems for existing Naxi forms of sociality and personhood. The key method of this project, an elaboration of traditional ethnographic participant observation, involves repatriating copies of pre-1949 Naxi texts from an archive at Beijing's Minzu University back to residents of Baidi, a Naxi community, and pursuing collaborative translation with Baidi residents using the texts. This work should yield data on the old texts as well as on their re-integration (or not) into contemporary life. In addition, currently in-use texts will be translated, observed in use, and documented photographically page by page, ultimately to produce a database of archival and in-use texts. The project will contribute to understanding the diverse ways that written texts shape social relations, and offer lens through which to trace post-1949 social transitions among China's rural, ethnic minority populations. By making the project's database available online through collaboration with the University of Michigan's Deep Blue archive, the research contributes to preserving a detailed record for future researchers.","maroon"

These data are a product of several international research programs (the World Ocean circulation experiment (WOCE), the CLImate VARiability and predictability program (CLIVAR), the International Ocean Carbon Coordination Project (IOCCP), the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP)), and national research programs - past, present and to come. Whenever possible the CCHDO provides these data in three community formats: WHP-Exchange, netCDF, and WOCE. The CCHDO seeks to assure that these data and their associated documentation are prepared and made readily available for immediate research and education uses, and that these data have a long service life. The CCHDO?s primary window to the research community is via its web site <http://cchdo.ucsd.edu>. The CCHDO maintains ties with designated national data archives like NODC/WDC-A to see that the entirety of its public holdings is formally archived and up to date at the archive.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The CCHDO brings together, verifies, and corrects content and format errors in the hydrographic, and tracer data used in large scale ocean carbon, global change, water mass, and circulation studies. The team assembles the data with relevant documentation, and carefully prepares them for dissemination and archive. In addition they work to promote appropriate methodology, community standards, communications, and data compatibility. The CCHDO data are created by over 100 data originators worldwide, sometimes with 5 or more investigators separately contributing to one bottle data file. The CCHDO makes it possible for all data users to cope with the temporal-, content-, and format-related file diversity these different originators engender. The CCHDO brings data together to a common content and readability standard, thereby greatly reducing the difficulties research and education data users encounter. A strong additional advantage is that the documentation associated with the data are collected, reorganized to a common standard (where possible), and preserved with the data.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The CCHDO enhances research infrastructure, the broad dissemination of results, and the integration of research and education. While the CCHDO does not generate new data, it makes the data better and more usable, thus more far reaching and ultimately more scientifically and socially relevant. Via the CCHDO?s actions, present-day and future US and international users of these CTD, routine hydrography, ocean carbon, and tracer ocean profile data can easily use any of the data files written in the ASCII or netCDF exchange formats. This both reduces the personnel costs to data users to import and use data and also makes these data available to a much wider audience in the research, educational, and broader communities who do not employ data specialists. Moreover, the careful assembly of documentation with the data helps to assure a service lifetime for the data far into the future, contributing to a broad range of future studies of long-term ocean variability. The clean-up of the data and rewriting into accepted data formats also make the data much more straightforward to import into computer models. The CCHDO supports CLIVAR and carbon science programs, and is a data component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon dioxide system. The CCHDO is hence part of a larger international effort to monitor the ocean?s response to climate change. The CCHDO puts into play the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community, and should be available to the community at large.","lavender"

They were produced consistently and continually through 2010 and have formed the basis for important discoveries about solar magnetic field and surface evolution. However, this valuable resource is now in imminent danger of being lost because the scientist in charge and his two assistants, who were trained by him and worked with him on the maps, have retired. They are the only people with intimate knowledge of the technique behind the charts. Furthermore, while much of the original data set has been saved in their homes, is has not otherwise been preserved in copies or in digital form. Nor is it protected from loss through flooding, fire, etc. The main purpose of this RAPID award is to ensure that the entire set of charts is organized, scanned and digitally processed using a consistent, machine-readable format, thus creating a readily accessible dataset that can be utilized scientifically for years to come. The two assistants will carry out the majority of the effort, in collaboration with solar physics scientist and experts in the scanning, digital processing and data archiving of scientific data. The final digitized, searchable maps will be archived at NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center. <br/><br/>This set of synoptic maps constitutes a unique and significant observational resource on the evolution of large-scale solar features over the course of four solar cycles. Once digitized, they can be used to measure the proportions of the solar surface exhibiting specific phenomena, and the locations of these features as a function of latitude and longitude (as defined by pixel location). The data can then be used to evaluate the proportions and their changes over time. This will provide extremely useful information that can be used to test theories and models for predicting the Sun's activity as a whole over a single cycle or over numerous cycles. It will also be useful for a wealth of other studies concerning specific features at the Sun, such as filaments, coronal holes or plage regions, as well as their variations over time in terms of quantity, location or movement.","fuchsia"

Two of the key parameters that can be used for seismic hazard assessment are seismic moment accumulation rate and strain accumulation rate. The GPS component of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) provides accurate vector velocities (< 1 mm/yr accuracy) at a spacing of 10 to 20 km along the SAFS. However, the velocity gradient (strain rate) varies most rapidly within 20 km of the major faults, so strain rate is not well resolved by the GPS data alone. Radar interferometry (InSAR) provides deformation maps at 100 m spatial resolution, although factors such as temporal decorrelation and atmospheric path errors have made it difficult to achieve this full resolution with sufficient precision to improve upon the GPS measurements. The L-band data provided by the ALOS satellite (JAXA) retains phase coherence over longer time intervals than the prior C-band missions. This improvement, combined with stacking techniques to reduce atmospheric errors, now makes it possible to image the entire SAFS using InSAR with unprecedented spatial coverage and resolution.<br/><br/>The primary focus of this research is to construct high spatial resolution vector surface deformation measurements by combining the high accuracy point measurements provided by PBO GPS data with the high spatial resolution InSAR measurements available through WInSAR from foreign and domestic SAR missions. The research has four main objectives:<br/><br/>- Resolve secular plate boundary deformation using new GPS and InSAR measurements provided by EarthScope (PBO and WInSAR). This involves the development of community software to preprocess the new data streams to be provided by the ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 InSAR satellites (2013 launch);<br/>- Use an integrated GPS-4D model-InSAR technique to better constrain fault slip rates and determine the depth of the locked/creeping transition on active faults of the SAFS;<br/>- Generate high-resolution estimates of strain rate and seismic moment rate along major faults of the SAFS; and<br/>- Explore methods for isolating non-tectonic deformation contributions common in both InSAR and GPS data.<br/><br/>Non-technical summary<br/><br/>Is California prepared for the next big earthquake? Estimates of earthquake potential along major faults, such as the San Andreas Fault System (SAFS), are used for developing scenario earthquakes, for setting regional building codes, and for setting earthquake insurance rates. While the timing of a major earthquake cannot be accurately predicted, the moment magnitude can be accurately estimated from geodetic measurements of present-day crustal deformation. The current array of 700 continuously operating GPS stations in western North America does not completely resolve the crustal deformation gradients (strain) along the major faults because the average station spacing is too large. This research is refining the crustal deformation measurements by computing and modeling the synthetic aperture radar data (SAR) archived at the Western North America InSAR consortium (WInSAR) and the Alaska Satellite Facility. This involves the generation and archive of large-scale (1000 km scale) crustal deformation grids at 0.5 km spatial resolution in a near-automatic fashion. Funding from this grant is supporting two Ph.D. students at SIO and UTEP (a Hispanic Serving Institute) and is being used for further development of undergraduate and graduate courses. This funding is also being used to develop a ?How InSAR Works? module for use in IRIS&#700;s Active Earth interactive kiosks on display around the country. In addition, funding is being used to move the GMTSAR software into the GMT distribution system where it is available to 15,000 users worldwide. We are distributing all high-resolution vector deformation data and maps to the scientific community and archive the results at UNAVCO.","hot_pink"

These collections form an archive of much of the world's known biodiversity. This archive is already used as an indispensable resource for many different purposes related to research in biology and conservation. This award will support a number of activities, including workshops that will explore a novel use of natural history collections as a resource for engineering innovation. The rationale behind this endeavor is that the world's biodiversity represents the outcomes of evolution, a process that shares many similarities with engineering optimization, but has been operating on a vast scale in terms of time, space, and the number of different species and individuals involved. Since no human engineering effort can come close to the time and spatial scales of biological evolution, biodiversity can be seen as a precious natural resource for optimizing knowledge that could have a major impact on technology development, finding solutions to major engineering challenges, and stimulating economic activity through innovation.<br/><br/>To achieve its goal of starting a viable process towards utilizing natural history collection as a resource for innovation, the set of activities supported by this award will bring together researchers from very different backgrounds to plan a strategy for a path forward. The first year-long activity will start with preparatory meetings by a core team to carefully craft an agenda so that a large interdisciplinary workshop on the topic can be productive and result in tangible outcomes. After this main workshop, a team of authors will continue to meet and digest the results of the main workshop into two sets of publications, one set aimed at the scientific/engineering community and the other at the general public. The first set of publications will be aimed at giving scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds specific suggestions as to how natural history collections could be leveraged for engineering innovation. These publication will also outline the pertinent challenges as well as potential solution strategies in as much technical detail as possible. The second set of publications will be aimed at providing policy makers and the general public a well-justified outline of the innovative and economic potential of natural history collections as well as estimates for the effort that would be required to realize this potential. The outcomes of the project will be archived on the website of the Center for Bioinspired Science and Technology at Virginia Tech (http://bist.centers.vt.edu).","puce"

A hundred years ago, almost all California Native languages still had speakers; in most cases there were active speech communities using traditional narrative, oratory, ritual, teaching, and other speech practices in addition to rich song cultures. During the early decades of the twentieth century, beginning in 1901, Native people recorded songs and spoken texts on wax cylinders in collaboration with anthropologists and linguists at the University of California, Berkeley. The resulting collection of 2,713 cylinders contains over 100 hours of recordings in 78 languages, including about half of California's Native languages. For seven languages these are the only known sound recordings, and in many other cases they include unique speech practices and otherwise unknown stories and songs. Today, though fewer than half of California's indigenous languages have any first-language speakers (in almost all cases fewer than half a dozen), many Native communities have active language restoration programs and would welcome access to sound recordings made a century ago.<br/><br/>This project will apply new technology developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to create audio transfers of all wax cylinders at UC Berkeley. This involves optical restoration using a precision optical probe that creates a high-resolution profile of the cylinder surface; this profile can be formed into a three-dimensional digital image. An algorithm on a computer then processes the image to calculate the stylus motion and numerically extract the audio signal. The resulting audio transfers are superior to those produced invasively (with a physical stylus), and can even be created from broken cylinders. The entire cylinder collection will be scanned and digitally archived within a three-year window, in a collaboration involving the Hearst Museum of Anthropology (where the wax cylinder collection is housed), the University Library (where the scanning and digitization will be done), and the Department of Linguistics (which operates the California Language Archive, an online resource where the resulting audio files will be archived and accessible).","maroon"

Approximately 7500 species are known, but three times that many may be undiscovered, especially in poorly explored places like tropical forests or the deep ocean. Better knowledge of the biodiversity of ciliates would translate into more effective management of ecosystems or new model organisms for biomedical research, but achieving this has been slower and more difficult than has been the case for multicellular organisms. Modern studies of biodiversity often use DNA from preserved specimens but there is no such archive for ciliates. Also, sequencing most genes has been more challenging for ciliates than for animals or plants. Lastly, researchers who study biodiversity of ciliates are scattered thinly and unevenly across the world, and many are younger investigators who have little money for traveling to meetings or other laboratories to build collaborations.<br/><br/>The International Research Coordination Network for Biodiversity of Ciliates (IRCN-BC) will be an international collaboration that will lower barriers to research on ciliate biodiversity, generate new collaborations, establish procedures for archiving material, and, most significantly, stimulate research that will unite the taxonomic, genetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. The IRCN-BC will accomplish these goals by sponsoring workshops and symposia to build strategies and develop techniques, by creating archives for preserved samples of cells and DNA, by maintaining a website to report activities, attract new members, promote collaborations, and share data, and by funding travel for researchers. The IRCN-BC will be a model for accelerating multidimensional investigation of biodiversity in other protistan groups. Students at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) traditionally get scant exposure to areas of biology outside biomedicine. The IRCN-BC will create an email listserv of contacts at MSIs to inform faculty and students about the IRCN-BC, especially connections between biodiversity and biomedicine. Students from underrepresented minority groups (African-American, Pacific Islander) will be targeted for inclusion in two workshops.","salmon"

A record of carbon-14 of atmospheric methane (14CH4) will be obtained for the last deglaciation and the Early Holocene, together with a supporting record of CH4 stable isotopes. In-situ cosmogenic 14C content and partitioning of 14C between different species (14CH4, C-14 carbon monoxide (14CO) and C-14 carbon dioxide (14CO2)) will be determined with unprecedented precision in ice from the surface down to ~67 m. Further age-mapping of the ablating ice stratigraphy will take place using a combination of CH4, CO2, &#948;18O of oxygen gas and H2O stable isotopes. High precision, high-resolution records of CO2, &#948;13C of CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O) and N2O isotopes will be obtained for the last deglaciation and intervals during the last glacial period. The potential of 14CO2 and Krypton-81 (81Kr) as absolute dating tools for glacial ice will be investigated. The intellectual merit of proposed work includes the fact that the response of natural methane sources to continuing global warming is uncertain, and available evidence is insufficient to rule out the possibility of catastrophic releases from large 14C-depleted reservoirs such as CH4 clathrates and permafrost. The proposed paleoatmospheric 14CH4 record will improve our understanding of the possible magnitude and timing of CH4 release from these reservoirs during a large climatic warming. A thorough understanding of in-situ cosmogenic 14C in glacial ice (production rates by different mechanisms and partitioning between species) is currently lacking. Such an understanding will likely enable the use of in-situ 14CO in ice at accumulation sites as a reliable, uncomplicated tracer of the past cosmic ray flux and possibly past solar activity, as well as the use of 14CO2 at both ice accumulation and ice ablation sites as an absolute dating tool. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the natural carbon cycle, as well as in its responses to global climate change. The proposed high-resolution, high-precision records of &#948;13C of CO2 would provide new information on carbon cycle changes both during times of rising CO2 in a warming climate and falling CO2 in a cooling climate. N2O is an important greenhouse gas that increased by ~30% during the last deglaciation. The causes of this increase are still largely uncertain, and the proposed high-precision record of N2O concentration and isotopes would provide further insights into N2O source changes in a warming world. The broader impacts of proposed work include an improvement in our understanding of the response of these greenhouse gas budgets to global warming and inform societally important model projections of future climate change. The continued age-mapping of Taylor Glacier ablation ice will add value to this high-quality, easily accessible archive of natural environmental variability. Establishing 14CO as a robust new tracer for past cosmic ray flux would inform paleoclimate studies and constitute a valuable contribution to the study of the societally important issue of climate change. The proposed work will contribute to the development of new laboratory and field analytical systems. The data from the study will be made available to the scientific community and the broad public through the NSIDC and NOAA Paleoclimatology data centers. 1 graduate student each will be trained at UR, OSU and SIO, and the work will contribute to the training of a postdoc at OSU. 3 UR undergraduates will be involved in fieldwork and research. The work will support a new, junior UR faculty member, Petrenko. All PIs have a strong history of and commitment to scientific outreach in the forms of media interviews, participation in filming of field projects, as well as speaking to schools and the public about their research, and will continue these activities as part of the proposed work.

What kinds of properties do these languages share and where do they diverge? Documenting and studying the intricacies, particularly in syntax (""sentence structure""), increases our understanding of the complex properties in a particular language as well as in closely related languages. While isolation caused by mountains or bodies of water has been one variable, this study asks these questions in an entirely different context by documenting the speech of a community that went into seclusion in the 16th century. With rapid change in the area in the linguistic and social landscape, there is urgency to document the language of this isolated area now, while there are still speakers. Investigating the grammar of such a language variety will show how it is both structurally similar to and different from related languages and contributes to the knowledge of relationships between languages in the same family tree. The project will train University of Iowa graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge technologies and methods for language documentation, digital file management, linguistic fieldwork and research methods in the language sciences. The collection and analysis of a publicly archived, wide variety of language materials will generate data of scholarly interest to other disciplines that depend on language-related material (anthropology, biology, history, geography), while increasing our scientific knowledge of the unique aspects of this language and its relatives.<br/><br/>William Davies of the University of Iowa leads an international collaboration with researchers at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, teaming up to document the language of the Baduy Dalam 'Inner Baduy,' a small group of about 1170 living in a remote area on the island of Java in Indonesia. The team will record natural speech (narratives and conversations) and lexical items to produce an audio and video transcribed corpus of Baduy Dalam speech, a dictionary (with special focus on culturally distinctive concepts), and a grammar sketch. Recordings, data files, and field notes will be archived at the University of Iowa and the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures, where they will be accessible to other researchers and the general public. Broader impacts include producing print and video materials for direct use by the Baduy as linguistic and cultural education resources. Baduy Dalam is of linguistic importance in part due to how its syntax manifests the Austronesian 'voice' system, which involves how predicates (e.g. ""subjects"" and ""objects"") pattern in sentences based on the verb and sentence type. These results will contribute to understanding of the micro-syntactic variation in the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world. The implications are thus important for typology, syntax, and linguistic studies of variation, especially the micro-variations in syntax, which have in many cases focused on larger world languages, like English, or Indo-European language subgroups, like Italian, Spanish and closely related Romance languages. This project will also support international research and training opportunities for a graduate student and it will stimulate new international collaborations between U.S. and Indonesian academic institutions. The NSF Office of International Science and Engineering is providing support for international activities associated with this project.","maroon"

A record of carbon-14 of atmospheric methane (14CH4) will be obtained for the last deglaciation and the Early Holocene, together with a supporting record of CH4 stable isotopes. In-situ cosmogenic 14C content and partitioning of 14C between different species (14CH4, C-14 carbon monoxide (14CO) and C-14 carbon dioxide (14CO2)) will be determined with unprecedented precision in ice from the surface down to ~67 m. Further age-mapping of the ablating ice stratigraphy will take place using a combination of CH4, CO2, &#948;18O of oxygen gas and H2O stable isotopes. High precision, high-resolution records of CO2, &#948;13C of CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O) and N2O isotopes will be obtained for the last deglaciation and intervals during the last glacial period. The potential of 14CO2 and Krypton-81 (81Kr) as absolute dating tools for glacial ice will be investigated. The intellectual merit of proposed work includes the fact that the response of natural methane sources to continuing global warming is uncertain, and available evidence is insufficient to rule out the possibility of catastrophic releases from large 14C-depleted reservoirs such as CH4 clathrates and permafrost. The proposed paleoatmospheric 14CH4 record will improve our understanding of the possible magnitude and timing of CH4 release from these reservoirs during a large climatic warming. A thorough understanding of in-situ cosmogenic 14C in glacial ice (production rates by different mechanisms and partitioning between species) is currently lacking. Such an understanding will likely enable the use of in-situ 14CO in ice at accumulation sites as a reliable, uncomplicated tracer of the past cosmic ray flux and possibly past solar activity, as well as the use of 14CO2 at both ice accumulation and ice ablation sites as an absolute dating tool. Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the natural carbon cycle, as well as in its responses to global climate change. The proposed high-resolution, high-precision records of &#948;13C of CO2 would provide new information on carbon cycle changes both during times of rising CO2 in a warming climate and falling CO2 in a cooling climate. N2O is an important greenhouse gas that increased by ~30% during the last deglaciation. The causes of this increase are still largely uncertain, and the proposed high-precision record of N2O concentration and isotopes would provide further insights into N2O source changes in a warming world. The broader impacts of proposed work include an improvement in our understanding of the response of these greenhouse gas budgets to global warming and inform societally important model projections of future climate change. The continued age-mapping of Taylor Glacier ablation ice will add value to this high-quality, easily accessible archive of natural environmental variability. Establishing 14CO as a robust new tracer for past cosmic ray flux would inform paleoclimate studies and constitute a valuable contribution to the study of the societally important issue of climate change. The proposed work will contribute to the development of new laboratory and field analytical systems. The data from the study will be made available to the scientific community and the broad public through the NSIDC and NOAA Paleoclimatology data centers. 1 graduate student each will be trained at UR, OSU and SIO, and the work will contribute to the training of a postdoc at OSU. 3 UR undergraduates will be involved in fieldwork and research.

This project will make accessible digital audio recordings of animal signals that can be used to address a host of scientific questions, including the responses of animals to anthropogenic noise and other human activities. By providing a useful co-curation system and encouraging collection of recordings along with physical specimens, this project will have a transformative influence on the way that researchers collect and use biological specimens in the future, and will serve as a useful model for collections facing similar co-curation challenges. <br/><br/>This project will also provide materials for extensive educational outreach at all age levels, and will have significant conservation impacts because the digitized material will contribute directly to our ability to assess and monitor biodiversity. Finally, this project will expand biological collection methods and help train the ""next generation"" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).","puce"

These data are static, however -- they have no provision for updating and enhancement nor the assurance of archive security and long-term preservation. In the case of material flow information, essential to the evaluation of metal use, recycling, import/exports flows, and losses to the environment, quantitative life cycle results have been published for some sixty elements, but rarely with the supporting information being publicly available and/or the detailed underlying and generated data available in a user-friendly format. Nonetheless, these cycles form the foundations for subsequent research related to materials sustainability, product lifetimes, international trade, carbon emissions, and many related topics. From this perspective, the present grant provides the necessary resources to fully document and transform the Yale archive of data on all aspects of materials sustainability for numerous metals and metalloids from its present form into a convenient, easily-accessed, and well-documented package. It will then be transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey for data formatting review, quality assessment, achieving, security, updating enhancement, and accessibility.<br/><br/>This project will enable public access to a unique dataset that was created in an academic setting, largely through public funding from NSF. As such the project provides a blueprint for a successful collaboration between academia and multiple government agencies that has the potential to benefit U.S. industry, U.S. government agencies, the U.S. research community, and others worldwide. The project will train a postdoctoral associate at Yale University and several USGS specialists in material flow analysis (MFA) methodology and MFA database structures. The results of the activity will be shared within potentially interested communities by publications and presentations in appropriate venues.","coral"

These languages have unique grammatical properties that make them important for the scientific study of cognitive/cultural variation, despite the small number of speakers they have. They display a mixture of grammatical characteristics typical of their language family (Malayic), and grammatical characteristics that are otherwise unknown in frequently studied Malayic languages like Malay/Indonesian.<br/><br/>Jernih-Sarolangun and Lolo-Kecil differ from Malay/Indonesian in that most words in the languages have two systematically different forms (technical term: ablaut). A major focus of this project is to document, describe and analyze the different grammatical factors that determine speakers' choice between these forms in each language. For example, in Jernih-Sarolangun, one verb form appears if the verb takes a full noun phrase as an object, or if the verb is used intransitively. The second verb form is employed if the object is a pronoun (which might be null). In comparison, the choice in Lolo Kecil is determined largely by transitivity alone, regardless of whether the object is full noun phrase or pronoun. However, if the verb is understood as contrasting with another verb, the form which normally appears without a direct object can also appear with an overt object. These variations are important in determining the ways that languages can differ from each other and the ways that languages are alike (possibly due to human genetic endowment). This project will sharpen our understanding of these and other grammatical alternations in these endangered languages.<br/><br/>The project includes the collection and archiving of samples of each language, and detailed description of the grammar and sound systems of the languages. In addition, theoretical studies will be submitted for journal publication. The archived data will be deposited in a publicly available archive of digital linguistic data. The research is an international collaboration that will be carried out by linguists from the University of Delaware and the Jakarta Field Station of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.","maroon"

Seismic network operators routinely analyze their seismograms to estimate various parameters, including time, location, and magnitude of each new earthquake, adding to a rapidly growing archive of digital seismic data. Catalogs of earthquake locations are a fundamental source of data in seismology, and in the Earth sciences in general. Yet these individual locations have had notoriously low spatial resolution, which limits their potential to address fundamental questions concerning the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, the nature of earthquakes, and the seismic hazards they impose on our society and the built environment. The main goal of this project is to significantly improve the location precision of millions of earthquakes on a global scale by applying higher-order earthquake location methods that take advantage of the increasing quantity and quality of seismic archives and the availability of affordable computing power. This project will focus on using the wealth of high-precision data to better understand, in a comparative way, the seismogenic structure and processes that control subduction zones worldwide. Results from this project are expected to find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and to have social impact in the areas of natural hazards and seismic verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).<br/><br/>The tremendous growth in global seismic archives over the last several decades, the continuous fall in computing costs, and advances in earthquake relocation methods provide a unique opportunity to substantially improve the spatial resolution of standard global earthquake catalogs. The locations of hypocenters in these catalogs, typically estimated one event at a time from phase arrival times observed at global seismic stations, have notoriously low accuracy that hamper studies in a wide range of research areas, not only in Seismology, but in the Geosciences in general. This continuing project builds on previous work that developed high-efficiency waveform cross-correlation and double-difference (DD) algorithms to relocate more than 3 million earthquakes listed in the combined bulletins of the International Seismological Centre (ISC) and NEIC?s Earthquake Data Report, spanning the years 1964-2012. These tools increase the precision of the earthquake locations by harnessing new procedures that can cope with the computational load of this massive-scale undertaking. Cross-correlation based phase delay times are measured on billions of pairs of waveforms, and efficient teleseismic double-difference algorithms invert these data in combination with reported phase arrival times. Initial results using this approach already reveal characteristic seismicity patterns in time and space, and provide new data that help gain insight into seismogenic processes at unprecedented resolution. This project will focus on the fine-scale structure of Wadati-Benioff zone seismicity at subduction zones and the nature of narrow double-seismic zones, and analyze the relocated seismicity associated with recent great subduction earthquakes to better understand their structural and kinematic behavior. A global DD catalog will likely find many applications in the Earth Sciences, and may help improve our understanding of the physical processes controlling earthquakes, our ability to image the structure and composition of the Earth?s interior, and our capability to estimate the hazards imposed by large earthquakes.","hot_pink"

Researchers need to be able to discover and understand scientific software to apply it to their projects, but the approaches for documenting software are typically language specific and not interoperable. This project will have a broad impact on multiple disciplines by increasing the interoperability and consistency of software descriptions and by providing examples that illustrate the utility of interoperable software repositories for citation, discovery, archiving and preservation of scientific software. Research relies heavily on scientific software, and a large and growing fraction of researchers must now develop custom software to conduct their own research. Despite this, infrastructure to support the preservation, discovery, reuse, and attribution of software lags substantially behind that of other research products such as journal articles and research data. This frustrates the progress of science in several ways: lacking a way to discover and access software written by other researchers means that multiple teams must re-invent the same wheel. Limited re-use or accreditation of software also discourages researchers from investing more time to improve the performance, reliability or usability of the software they write. This lag is driven not so much by a lack of technology as it is by a lack of unity: existing mechanisms to archive, document, index, share, discover, and cite software contributions are varied among research disciplines and among software archives, and rarely consistent with best practices. The project will convene key stakeholders from software and data repositories to address this issue by aligning existing software metadata approaches. This alignment of software documentation will increase the efficiency and scale or research across disciplines, and simplify the process for researchers to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects.<br/><br/>This project will have three distinct phases:<br/><br/>1. Define a crosswalk table between exiting metadata schema for software<br/>2. Develop prototype applications illustrating the value of crosswalk metadata<br/>3. Assess and communicate impact of results.<br/><br/>The researchers will convene a meeting of repository and science stakeholders to harmonize approaches to software metadata. Rather than try and define yet another standard, they will map the correspondences between standards already in use -- a Rosetta stone of software metadata. In this process, the investigators will identify metadata use cases that have guided existing software metadata descriptions (e.g. more or different metadata may be needed to install software than to cite it, and even more to extend it), and then agree upon which metadata concepts are needed for each use case. This phase will identify some use cases that are not fully supported by existing software repositories (for instance, Zenodo is interested in associating software with funders as a use case but does not recognize funder identifiers yet). This will set the stage for the second phase where the crosswalk table will be used to harmonize the implementation of software metadata in three major repositories that support software deposition (KNB, Zenodo, Figshare). The researchers will modify the software and provenance metadata terms used in the DataONE federation to be interoperable with the crosswalk, and create a tool for generating and uploading software with this metadata to the KNB repository (a member repository of DataONE). Collaborators will extend the existing integration between the software repository GitHub and the data repositories Zenodo and figshare to provide interoperable software metadata. In the final phase, the team will conduct an assessment with researchers at a relevant scientific meeting to evaluate the effectiveness of the crosswalk for the identified software use cases and will summarize results in a scientific paper.","mauve"

It supports research and education to collect, analyze, and compare data on materials from vast sources. All solid objects - from an airplane wing to a frying pan - have a microscopic structure that is usually not visible to the naked eye. This structure determines the properties of the material as a whole - whether it is strong or weak, for example. For the past century, materials scientists have studied these structures by using microscopes to take pictures (called micographs) of them. They then measure the important features seen in the microscopic images and relate those measurements to the properties of the material.<br/>Just as in personal photography, digital cameras have enabled materials scientists to take more pictures and do more with them than ever before. Moreover, older micrographs have been scanned in to digital archives. Materials scientists are now confronted with a set of images that is too large and too diverse to analyze manually. Fortunately, computer scientists have developed ""machine vision"" computer programs that identify similarities in large sets of images by in a sense mimicking how humans see objects. This project will gather micrographs from many sources into an open archive and use machine vision programs to search, sort, and classify them automatically without significant human intervention.<br/>By synthesizing microscopic image data at a previously impossible scale, this project creates a foundation for discovering new connections between microscopic structures and materials properties. The results will help improve current materials and even develop new ones. The data will be made available to the broader community.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research; the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation Division; and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure contribute funds to this award. It supports research and education to collect, analyze, and compare data on materials from vast sources. Over the past 100 years, materials scientists have made great progress in acquiring, analyzing, and comparing microstructural images. Much of this effort has been directed toward deep understanding of particular materials systems or classes of microstructures. When the catalog of possible microstructural features is known, imaging techniques can take advantage of well-defined feature characteristics to analyze microstructures with high precision. However, when the features of interest are not known a priori, these methods become intractable, inaccurate, or fail completely. Thus, typically, they are applied only to a pre-selected set of micrographs, chosen by a human expert. In contrast, the goal of this effort is to develop a general method to find useful relationships between micrographs without assumptions about what features may be present. Such an approach can leverage the explosion in digital data over the past two decades to survey the breadth of available microstructures efficiently and without significant human intervention.<br/>Capitalizing on recent advances in computer science, this project applies a subset of data science concepts - including data harvesting, machine vision, and machine learning - to advance the science of microstructure. The result will be a framework for finding connections between microstructural images within and across material systems, which will support outcomes ranging from computational tools to discovery science, including:<br/>- New open source tools for extracting micrographs and associated metadata from various digital archives, including the internet, PDF documents, and local storage media.<br/>- A comprehensive database of publicly available micrographs with traditional text-based search and novel image-based search functions. <br/>- Optimized, high throughput, automatic machine vision techniques to identify microstructural features that are salient to image analysis and microstructural science.<br/>- Automatic and objective machine learning systems that find relationships between microstructures in order to discover new structure-property and structure-performance connections.<br/>The goal of microstructural science is to understand the connection between microstructural features and materials properties. By developing an open-access, automatic, and objective machine learning system for finding relationships between microstructural images, this project creates a foundation for discovering new connections that may inspire deeper understanding or predictive capabilities.","goldenrod"

These comparative studies of earthworm diversity provide a unique opportunity to evaluate several major environmental issues, such as soil ecosystem services and the existence and consequences of biodiversity loss and species invasion. About one fourth of all known species on Earth resides in the soil, but most of this biodiversity is hidden due to the amount of labor needed to sample, extract and identify soil organisms. DNA metabarcoding is a technique that targets extracellular DNA, that is DNA from lysed or degraded cells in the soil. Thus, it provides the opportunity to identify species that are not physically present in the soil at the time of sampling. The continental scale coverage of NEON data and archived soil samples provides a unique opportunity to examine patterns of earthworm species richness at different spatial scales.<br/><br/>The first phase of the study will establish protocols tailored to soil samples collected and archived by NEON. Soils and earthworms collected at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) will be used for this phase. The main goal is to establish the minimum amount of soil needed for sequencing. The PIs will also sample soil within three different SERC habitats representing three distinct earthworm communities. Different species are active at different times of the year, thus they will conduct sampling both in spring and summer 2016. They plan to take composite samples mimicking the sampling that is currently used by the NEON network. In the next stage DNA from soil samples from the NEON archive will be extracted and sequenced. The species diversity data will then be correlated with environmental data, also collected by NEON. The environmental data includes: local climatic conditions, the amount and quality of leaf litter, and soil properties, particularly pH, organic matter content and texture. If available, data on soil microbe diversity will also be used as metadata to evaluate and interpret species richness patterns for earthworms. The PIs will publish papers focusing on the new methods, and on the results of the genetic analyses of earthworm biological diversity. Species new to science and/or significant new records will also be described in separate papers.","golden"

These artifacts are used to evaluate new capabilities, algorithms, bottlenecks and trade-offs. Empirical study is behind the rapid pace of innovation in creating faster, lower energy and more reliable systems. This experimental approach lies at the core of development that fuels the nation's information economy. Given the critical importance of experimental study to developing new computer systems, several efforts are underway to curate experimental results through accountable research. One effort, Artifact Evaluation (AE), is being adopted to promote high quality artifacts and experimentation, including making public the experimental information necessary for reproducibility. However, the rapid adoption of AE is hampered by technical challenges that create a high barrier to the process: there is no consistent or simple environment, or mechanism, to package and reproduce experiments for AE. Authors rely on their own approaches, leading to much time consumed, as well as considerable variability in the ways materials are prepared and evaluated, unnecessarily obstructing the AE process. <br/><br/>To overcome the technical challenges with AE, and to more broadly encourage adoption of AE in computer science and engineering research, this project is developing a software infrastructure, Experiment and Artifact System for Evaluation (EASE), to create and run experiments specifically for AE, in which authors create, conduct and share artifacts and experiments. It allows for repeating, modifying, and extending experiments. Authors may also use EASE to package and upload their experiments for archival storage in a digital library. EASE is being developed and deployed for two use cases, namely compilers and real-time systems, keeping the project tractable to address specific needs. These communities have overlapping but also distinct requirements, helping to ensure EASE can also be extended and<br/>used by other computer systems research communities as well.<br/><br/>EASE will be release as open source software, based on an Experiment Management System (EMS) previously developed by the project investigator in a project call Open Curation for Computer Architecture Modeling (OCCAM), used to define and conduct experiments using computer architecture simulators. Using EMS as a starting point, EASE will provide AE support, by: 1) separating EMS from OCCAM's repository and hardware services, transforming the EMS infrastructure into EASE, a fully standalone, sustainable, and extensible platform for AE; 2) supporting record and replay (for repeating and reproducing results, as well as provenance) of artifacts and experiments as part of normal development and experimental practice to ease participation in AE by authors and evaluators; 3) supporting artifacts,workflows of artifacts and experiments that run directly on a machine, including specialized hardware and software, and run indirectly on a simulator or emulator; 4) allowing both user-level (artifacts and experiments as user processes) and system-level (artifacts and experiments involving kernel changes) innovations; 5) providing consistent/uniform access, whether locally or remotely, to artifacts and experiments; 6) simplifying viewing, running, modifying, and comparing experiments by innovators (i.e., during innovation development), artifact evaluators (during AE), and archive users (after publication); 7) enabling indexing (object locators and search tags) and packaging of artifacts and experiments for AE and for archival deployment (e.g., to ACM?s or IEEE?s Digital Library); and 8) refining, expanding, generalizing, and documenting EASE to ensure it is robust, maintainable and extensible, and that it can be used and sustained by different CSR communities (starting with real-time and compilers, given their different artifacts, data and methods).","mauve"

Stations are morphing from being facilities that provided infrastructure for field-based research to proactive entities that actively direct research towards emerging areas of knowledge, generate baseline data through biophysical monitoring, and compile, archive, and facilitate synthesis and reuse of data generated in their midst. This new profile increases the effectiveness of field stations as research centers, because they: (a) provide basic long-term monitoring of biophysical data (e.g., through meteorological stations), which allows both researchers to understand their observed patterns and station staff to document any changes in their biophysical conditions, (b) focus research efforts in critical areas of knowledge and reduce duplication of efforts, and (c) act as a data repository to ensure that long-term data that is collected by the individual efforts of researchers and research teams are not only secured, but available for further reuse. This profile responds to two critical drivers: the urgent need to understand how our world is changing and the need to optimize research resources. This project provides the technological infrastructure that will allow three cutting-edge tropical field research stations to update and upgrade their biophysical monitoring equipment and to establish a Tropical node of DataONE. The upgraded biophysical monitoring equipment will allow the stations to more reliably track environmental variables, such as air and soil temperature and moisture, rainfall, solar intensity, and available water. The Tropical node of DataONE will allow the Organization for Tropical Studies to become the first tropical field station network to proactively retrieve and store data collected over 50 years so that it will be available to the whole scientific community for analyzing temporal and historical trends, measuring changes in the last half century, and projecting the fate of tropical forests. <br/><br/>Despite the deluge of information that has accumulated among field stations, these data are not readily available (Borgman et al. 2007). Most historical ecological field data are scattered and inaccessible, unintelligible (no metadata) or dispersed across platforms and digital formats hindering their reuse and synthesis (Heidorn 2008). Such dark data are at risk of being lost forever when scientists retire or die. Also, most field stations institutionally monitor a suite of biogeophysical variables (such as meteorological data) as a reference for the research community that they serve, but often these long-term data series are inconsistently collected and maintained and hard to access. Changing norms in data sharing and an increased scientific need for historical data on natural systems impose the responsibility on field stations to recover and archive dark data from historical field studies and to standardize, update, and make available past and current biogeophysical monitoring data. This project enables the Organization for Tropical Studies (OTS) to establish an Institutional Data Repository for data generated at its three field stations in Costa Rica for almost 50 years. The data repository will be part of DataONE network and will archive and make available biogeophysical monitoring data collected institutionally (e.g., meteorological and hydrological data, GIS files, and digital biological collections) as well as data collected by independent researchers who have conducted field research at the stations. The project also will allow OTS to upgrade, standardize, and automate further its meteorological stations to collect climatic and hydrological data. Both components of this project will foster field research that leverages historic data as a reference for new observations and facilitate secondary e-research on historic and current trends of terrestrial tropical ecosystems. Such research will greatly expand the ability of scientists to assess impacts of global change on tropical systems and to improve the representation of key tropical terrestrial ecosystem processes in earth system models. This project will set a new standard for open access of data and expand research opportunities for the broader scientific community. Furthermore, the data will enhance the opportunities for new generations of young scientists who conduct research at the stations (as research assistants, through fellowships, or on site-based REU programs) or who participate in OTS field-courses centered at the stations (through OTS graduate and undergraduate programs) or who visit the stations independently through faculty-led educational experiences.

Operating the PS1 System includes managing the observatory, the telescope and its camera, an image processing pipeline, a relational database, and servers for the reduced science products. The PS1 Surveys include five specific studies covering a wide range of astronomical problems: 1) a ~30,000 square degree survey of the entire sky north of declination -30 degrees, 2) a medium deep survey of some 70 square degrees in well-studied fields at high galactic latitude, 3) a solar system ecliptic plane survey optimized for the discovery of Near Earth Objects and Kuiper Belt Objects, 4) a stellar transit survey towards the Galactic bulge, and 5) a deep survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) to detect microlensing events.

Designed to enable comparability across systems and leverage the costs of data preparation, Shared Task Evaluation Campaigns operationalize research problems as tasks that are open to participation by researchers with uniform data, task specifications, evaluation metrics, and open reporting of results and system methodologies.Experience with STECs for speech and language technologies has shown that they have helped standardize shared data, create useful evaluation tools, and provide venues for publishing, comparing, and discussing results. Participants will evaluate both the language archive data available for computational processing and the types of STECs that should be undertaken. The results of the workshop can have long term impacts through acceleration of endangered language documentation, enhancement of digital language archives, and development of novel computational techniques for low-resource languages.","indigo"

This delta, named for the three large rivers that flow into it from the Himalayan and Burmese Ranges, encompasses most of Bangladesh. In addition to its size, this delta is notable because it is at the active juncture of three tectonic plates and receives over one gigaton of sediment annually from the three large rivers. Only about one-third of this sediment remains in the delta because the delta is sinking so rapidly. This combination preserves a tremendous stratigraphic archive of erosional processes in the Himalaya, the river-based processes that are building the GBMD, the tectonics of the active plate boundaries it overlies, and the interactions among these processes. This record is largely unexplored and little is known about the fundamental interactions between sedimentation and tectonics at this scale. This PIRE team will use a broad suite of disciplines and techniques to collectively study the sedimentary and hydrological processes, tectonics, structural geology, and seismology essential to unravelling GBMD dynamics. <br/><br/>The PIRE team will first create a record of the stratigraphic architecture of the delta using a mixture of advanced technical and local manual methods. Core areas of the project include: 1) defining the tectonic plate boundaries that are buried by sedimentation; 2) identifying potential sources of future earthquakes; 3) investigating the relative causes of subsidence rates due to longer term effects (e.g., sediment loading, tectonics, and compaction) vs. shorter term effects (e.g., earthquakes and human interventions); 4) investigating rapid channel switches of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers; and 5) assembling a comprehensive, integrated record of delta dynamics by coupling tectonics and hydrological processes, and by linking long-term steady processes with abrupt, short-term events. <br/><br/>Bangladesh is a developing country that is the size of Iowa, but with a 50-fold greater population of almost 160 million people. This impoverished nation is extremely vulnerable to natural hazards related to the dynamism of the delta system. Such hazards include widespread seasonal flooding, river erosion and channel redirections, permanent land loss from sea level rise, naturally-occurring arsenic in groundwater, recurrent cyclones and monsoons, landslides, and huge earthquakes. Because such infrequent geologic events are poorly understood, there is little long-term planning to address the timescales at which the dynamic GBMD landscape is changing, leaving a growing population at risk. Reliable knowledge of geologic processes is therefore a prerequisite for effective infrastructure design, risk-reduction and resource optimization in Bangladesh. <br/><br/>The PIRE project provides a compelling international education opportunity for all participants by collaboratively engaging them in research on an important fundamental problem, the results of which could reduce the impact of future delta-related hazards. It will train the next generation of U.S. earth and environmental scientists to work globally via international fieldwork, laboratory experiments and analysis, and modelling. Graduate students and undergraduates from PIRE institutions will be able to conduct research in Bangladesh and enroll in interdisciplinary field courses there; additional research trips and field schools will be open to students from institutions not directly involved in the PIRE research efforts. The project will also broaden participation across PIRE institutions and strengthen the geosciences dimensions of an interdisciplinary course on water issues in Bangladesh taught at the University of Minnesota. <br/><br/>The PIRE project will allow the U.S. institutions to build their capacity for international engagement. It will strengthen and link longstanding ongoing research involvement in Bangladesh on several campuses. It will couple the U.S. institutions in an international network of delta experts in Europe and South Asia. Members of the project will also take advantage of the unique ""Experimental Earthscape"" and computational facilities at the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED), an NSF-funded Science and Technology Center at the University of Minnesota. Linkage to NCED, which supports many researchers studying the Mississippi River delta, means this PIRE has the potential to have a large national impact by providing fundamental new insights into the behavior of delta systems. This award will also help build Bangladeshi research capacity and infrastructure via the collaboration with the Delta Study Centre (DSC) and Dhaka University Earth Obseratory (DUEO) at Dhaka University (DU). The project should help position DSC and DUEO as centers of excellence on deltaic sedimentary and tectonic processes and establish them as a focal points for GMBD research with strong faculty, archived sedimentary data, and oversight of critical seismic and GPS networks. <br/><br/>The collaborating institutions in the U.S. are Columbia University (NY), Vanderbilt University (TN), the University of Minnesota, and City University of New York, Queens College. Collaborating foreign institutions are the University of Dhaka (Bangladesh), Bremen University (Germany), Physical Research Laboratory (India), the Bengal Engineering and Science University (India), and Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (Italy). <br/><br/>This project is cofunded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Earth Sciences.","chartreuse"

So far, the largest event in the sequence is the April 1, 2014 magnitude 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake. The ground deformation caused by this large earthquake will persist long after the earthquake and decay over a period of years. Measurements of the surface deformation during and after the event can provide important information about the properties of the earth in the region, improve understanding of deformation processes, and aid in determining regions with a high likelihood of producing large aftershocks. Large dense GPS networks installed by U.S., German, French, Peruvian, and Chilean groups in Chile will record this deformation close to the earthquake epicenter but significant deformation is expected farther away in Bolivia, a very poorly instrumented region. This rapid response project will install new GPS networks in Bolivia, collect data from existing GPS sites in Chile and Bolivia, and analyze satellite synthetic aperture radar data in order to fully capture the ground motion associated with this event. These data will contribute to understanding the physics and hazard potential of large megathrust earthquakes in Chile and elsewhere, such as Cascadia, Alaska, and Japan.<br/><br/>The April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake was the largest event in an unusual sequence of earthquakes, which began in the northern Chile subduction zone on March 16, 2014. Based on the USGS preliminary teleseismic and surface wave inversion, slip occurred along a 250 km along-strike and about 150 km down-dip section of the Chile megathrust that last failed in an M 8.8 earthquake in 1877. U.S., Chilean, Peruvian, German, and the French groups have built relatively dense continuously operating GPS (CGPS) and survey mode GPS (SGPS) station networks in this region, thus the near-field inter-, co- and post-seismic transient signals will be well observed in northern Chile. However, there will be significant co-seismic and post-seismic transient motion up to 700 km from the main event, incorporating nearly all of the Altiplano and at least much of eastern Cordillera in Bolivia, and the Puna of northwestern Argentina. Measuring the mid- and far-field co- and post-seismic signals in the Altiplano and beyond will be critical to any geodynamic modeling effort. The Bolivian Altiplano, nevertheless, is very poorly instrumented and so cannot, at present, provide the observations required for accurate inversions of afterslip and lithospheric relaxation. In rapid response to the April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake, the research team will: (1) install 10 new CGPS stations in Bolivia; (2) reoccupy SGPS sites in Bolivia and Chile; (3) retrieve data from 5 CGPS stations within the PLUTONS network in Bolivia and Chile; and (4) acquire and analyze about 100 SAR scenes from Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X. Data will be made immediately available to the international earth science community through the UNAVCO Facility Archive. SAR data will be tasked and made available to the community with the password-protected restrictions required by the foreign space agencies through the WinSAR archive hosted by the UNAVCO Facility. Low latency geodetic data processing could be critical in determining regions with a high likelihood of producing large aftershocks and for hazard mitigation efforts because the largest aftershock (M 7.7 on April 3) was larger than expected, potentially indicating continued unusual activity with the neighboring segments thought to retain a large slip deficit.","hot_pink"

Roadtrip Nation is an independent, award-winning organization that empowers students to define their own roads in life through resources such as its annual public television series, live campus events, publicized books, multimedia online content, and innovative educational resources. The Roadtrip Nation Experience curriculum connects students to the vast Roadtrip Nation Interview Archive, which chronicles the diverse personal stories and pathways of successful individuals from across the United States and other countries around the world. The individuals featured within the Interview Archive share personal tales about navigating life's choices, overcoming obstacles, and working hard to define their own roads in life. They range from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies to scientists, mechanics, artists, TV producers, accountants, and beyond. To date, very few of the interviewees have been computer scientists or have even made use of computing in creative ways in their chosen careers. This pilot project will pilot the Roadtrip Nation approach for computing, building a small number of initial interviews and related materials that showcase computing careers in ways that are engaging to students. The goal would be to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach in expanding student appreciation of the wide range of applications of computing. If the approach is successful, it could expand into an entire Roadtrip focused on computer science.<br/><br/>Through this pilot project, Roadtrip Nation will lay the groundwork and provide proof-of-concept for a CS Roadtrip, leveraging a combination of multimedia deliverables, an evidence-based educational curriculum, and dynamic engagement strategies that will provide critical connections between students' natural interests, positive role models who align with those interests, and corresponding CS educational and career pathways. To that end, the CS Roadtrip Pilot will develop up to four student-facing videos that feature the stories of diverse computing professionals, appropriate for on-air, online, and classroom purposes, along with the appropriate Learning Guides. The materials and curriculum will be implemented in up to four partner schools in California. In partnership with the Educational Policy Improvement Center (EPIC), Roadtrip Nation will develop an evaluation strategy that measures the pilot project impacts, particularly with underserved students, and illuminates the potential of a fully developed CS Roadtrip Project.","olive"

A goal of the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet) is to add 50 new semi-permanently monumented, continuously operating, Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) stations spanning multiple Caribbean and Caribbean bordering nations. COCONet goals also call for the integration of GPS data from up to 50 existing stations operating in the Caribbean. The new cGPS stations will, in some cases, be co-located with existing tide gauges, thus supporting studies of sea level change in response to current global warming, and will be mated with surface meteorological observational equipment (Metpacks) to significantly expand spatiotemporal geodetic and atmospheric observational infrastructure in a region of complex tectonics with substantial earthquake, tsunami, volcanic, tropical storm and hurricane, flooding and landslide hazards. COCONet will provide a backbone fiducial and meteorologic observational network and COCONet data and data products that will be freely available through the UNAVCO archive will be available to serve a broad range of basic tectonic and atmospheric research investigations and enable observations of immediate relevance for advancing understanding, mitigating and perhaps predicting regional geohazards. Some specific questions that COCONet data could help to address include: 1) How rigid is the Caribbean plate?; 2) What are the slip rates along active faults that bound the Caribbean plate?; 3) How is stress released at convergent plate boundaries and how is stress transferred across plate boundaries?; and 4) How can we better understand and assess hazards in the Caribbean and Central American regions? Atmospheric questions that could be advanced by proposed GPS meteorological determinations and surface measurements of atmospheric physical properties include: 1) How sensitive is tropospheric water vapor content to changes in sea surface temperatures?; and 2) How does the distribution of precipitable water vapor across the Caribbean region influence the genesis, intensification and vectoring of tropical storms and hurricanes? <br/><br/>COCONet data will flow via the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) data management system and be available via the Web-accessible UNAVCO data archive. Low-latency data telemetry will be via cellular modem or through VSAT satellite communications to the PBO Network Operations Center in Boulder, Colorado. These data will be processed into derived geodetic products, including combined GPS station position and velocity estimates, simplified position time series and velocity field estimates in multiple formats, at the existing PBO GPS Analysis Centers at Central Washington University and New Mexico Tech and the Analysis Center Coordinator at MIT. In addition, UCAR will estimate tropospheric precipitable water vapor (PV) every 30 minutes from observations of GPS radio frequency signal propagation delays along the path length between the satellite transmitter and the receiver coupled with concurrent surface measurement of barometric pressure. The PV observations will feed into operational numerical weather models run several times per day. <br/><br/>The project will engage Caribbean researchers, their students and governmental agency representatives with the goal of empowering these nations to utilize COCONet data for both scientific and socioeconomic purposes. Real-time data from COCONet will be made available to the International GNSS Service (IGS) to help densify GPS observations in a region of the globe with few existing real-time data streams and thereby improve GPS satellite orbit calculations and help to refine the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF).","hot_pink"

NSF Geosciences previously supported the design, construction and initial operations of COCONet (Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network) to promote advances in in tectonic and weather hazards research in the pan-Caribbean region (EAR-1042906). COCOnet development represents a partnership with 28 sovereign nation and 41 distinct administrative entities in the circum-Caribbean region. A network of over 80 continuously operating Global Positioning System and meteorological observation stations (GPS/Met) that were procured and deployed or refurbished with support from the COCONet construction awards is now nearly complete. In addition, the managing institution, UNAVCO, was able to negotiate with Caribbean partners for the ingestion of an additional 62 GPS data streams engaging Caribbean country regional data centers in the process. All data are publically accessible via the UNAVCO Data archive. Most recently over 80% of all COCONet sites were delivering data to the UNAVCO archive and 45 of those stations deliver in near real time and at high rate (1 Hz). The COCONet data support: 1) constraints on the tectonics of the entire Caribbean region; 2) the enhancement of atmospheric observations that can be used to test and extend climate models; 3) improvement of the analysis of local geodetic measurements by providing access to an integrated backbone of reference stations; and 4) improved likelihood of forecasting natural hazards that pose such a significant threat to the region.<br/><br/>The focus of the workshop presentations and discussions will be on the scientific results, current status and operational requirements, identification of possible pathways to sustain operations into the future, and international capacity building opportunities afforded by the COCONet GPS/Met network. The proposed workshop will bring together scientists, government agency and emergency management officials to discuss the scientific achievements and operational success of COCONet to date, this will include scientists and students from several Caribbean region countries including representatives that are now in charge of established regional COCONet data centers. The workshop will address issues such as hardware and software standardization and will have focused talks highlighting regional partner experiences on the status of the network in their country and how they are planning to maintain and operate COCONet systems. Regional Data Center (RDC) directors from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Barbados will present the status of the data centers in their country and ideas about how to maintain these regional centers for the long-term. The workshop will engage student participation from Caribbean and U.S. academic institutions. This grant is made with support from multiple Programs in the Geosciences Directorate and the Office of International Science and Engineering. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of advancing understanding of geohazards that routinely impact the interests of the U.S. as well the training of students in geoscience research and research methods with potential downstream workforce benefits to earth science, meteorology, engineering and emergency management sectors.","hot_pink"

There are four strands in this work, three involving theoretical study of strongly-interacting particles and one managing a scientific data archive gateway. The thrust of the first strand is to understand from basic principles how a few fundamental building blocks, the quarks and gluons of QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics), generate the experimentally observed hadrons, such as the proton, neutron and other exotic particles, as well their properties and interactions. This work has significant relevance for nuclear physics. The second and third branches of this research program explore models of physics ""Beyond the Standard Model"", in particular investigating the possibility that the newly discovered Higgs particle might be a composite of ""quark-like"" particles, or even a manifestation of extra dimensional physics. Finally, the fourth part of this research program is the maintenance of a large, public, internationally accessible repository of lattice gauge theory data, allowing researchers around the world to access and build on the work of others, thereby significantly leveraging the investment in this work and that of other similar researchers.<br/><br/>The broader significance of this work is to advance our current understanding of the fundamental constituents, structure, and interactions of matter and the universe. The Standard Model of particle physics encapsulates the way that quarks and leptons interact, and explains all known accelerator data. This Model is much like the Periodic Table in chemistry at the turn of the 18th century: we have the table and its mathematical description of the interactions of its constituents, but we have no understanding of why the interactions take the form and structure that they do. In chemistry, the deeper understanding of the Periodic Table came with the next level of physics --- quantum theory, explaining why atoms have the properties and interactions that they do. We are at a similar crossroads now in our understanding of particle physics and the Standard Model, poised to break through to the next level of understanding of the structure of matter, and the results of this research project might potentially be one step in that direction. On the other hand, the data archive management component of this project uses the latest high-performance grid technologies to make the results of this work and other researchers around the world available to each other, greatly multiplying the return on the scientific investment made by the public.","forest_green"

With its launch in 2002, eBird opened a new era of live, online checklisting for birders, and it soon became one of the world's largest citizen-science projects. By 2012, eBird had amassed 100 million total bird observations, and early in 2014 that number is 170 million-on track to double the previous decade's worth of data in just 2 years. With more than 200,000 citizen-science participants worldwide, eBird acts as a global-scale, real-time bird monitoring mechanism that is innovating new models of conservation. For example, a first-of-its-kind conservation project in California is using eBird models to target the flooding of rice fields in the specific places, and at precisely the right times, for waterfowl and shorebirds during migration. eBird's openly available data has been downloaded by more than 6,000 students, educators, government staff, and researchers, resulting in more than 110 peer-reviewed scientific papers. True to its beginnings, eBird is still grounded in serving as an essential tool for birding. More than 7 million people access eBird every year to explore data through interactive exploration, visualization and analysis tools that help birders find more birds.<br/><br/><br/>Much of the research in basic and applied ecology is founded in descriptions of distribution and abundance of species. Long-term, well-organized data covering broad spatial scales are necessary for documenting change, generating hypotheses for their causes, and ultimately understanding how these changes relate to overall ecosystem health and function. While collecting a single-species occurrence datum is a well-understood process, the coordinated collection, curation, access, and storage of these data is no small task. Appropriately structured and sustained, the cyberinfrastructure that supports large species occurrence datasets can add value to the data, instead of merely acting as a tool for aggregating observations. The eBird data management infrastructure provides a unique resource for students, scientists, land managers, governments and amateurs. eBird's data: (1) come from a single, consistently gathered and curated source that is openly available and widely in use, (2) represents a substantial proportion of all available data on distribution of all organisms globally, and (3) provides these data in not just minimal form but as a set of value-added products that lower the threshold of data management needed to use these data.

Microbes are of particular interest because, unlike most animals and plants, they can survive very long periods of extreme conditions. Therefore, it is possible that some microbes in permafrost are not fossils but are still alive -- essentially, living fossils. This research addresses an unresolved question of whether microbes embedded in permafrost are extinct, representing ancient terrestrial surface or marine communities preserved through time, or actively living communities that have been evolving since being buried. To determine how long microbial communities can live in permafrost, this project will study permafrost collected from the oldest known sediments of the Northern Hemisphere, which occur in Siberia. These intriguing marine and lake sediments are five thousand to three million years old and are found in stratified cliffs. This project will help scientists understand how biological communities respond to large changes in the environment, and its results will be shared with university students and high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>This five year project will document evolution of taxonomic, genetic and functional biodiversity over time using state of the art ""omic"" approaches combined with single cell genomic, cultivation studies and physical-chemical characterization of permafrost sediments. One of the key challenges of this project will be the application of evolutionary models to the DNA sequence datasets to distinguish between permafrost strata containing fossil archive models versus contemporary community models. The data will elucidate evolutionary mechanisms that shape taxonomic, genetic and functional diversity, providing insight into genome evolution and microbial adaptation to low temperatures. Functional, population genetic and phylogenetic approaches will be integrated. The international nature of this project provides a platform to expand a network of collaborative permafrost research with open system data management and sharing. This project will train scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels, and engage high school teachers through molecular biology workshops. Interaction with Russian collaborators and travel to the Siberian study sites will promote international cooperation and provide training to students in how to conduct research with colleagues from different cultures.","salmon"

The ability to use DNA to predict the traits of a grown plant, from its development to its productivity, remains one of the recognized grand challenges of plant biology. Even more relevant and incomplete is the understanding of the chain of events that lead from DNA to trait. A complete understanding of a plant's biological system will allow the identification of the key regulatory points that impact its traits of economic importance, while also allowing their prediction. In this project novel approaches will be developed to predict the development and the growth properties of plants, and their immediate regulators. These approaches will integrate information beyond DNA to include gene expression data, and create a more complete description and prediction of trait regulation. Tools developed here will be disseminated to the community by the release of analysis software packages, and workshops will be conducted to enhance teaching of quantitative genetics and statistical methods in predictive models to the scientific community. The project incorporates a training component focused on high-school teachers and students. High-school teachers will join the investigator laboratories to learn about real-world applications of genomics and develop curriculum with support of the University of Florida Center for Precollegiate Education and Training (CPET). Students from underrepresented groups will be trained in science through CPET's Student Science Training Program. The proposed research will also provide ample opportunities to train graduate students at the intersection between quantitative and statistical genetics, and genomics. <br/><br/>Genomic prediction of complex traits is a critical tool in animal and plant breeding. However, the ability to fully explain a phenotypic trait is still limited, in part because several dimensions of information are either not available or not incorporated to prediction models. In this project, genome sequence information will be used initially to predict gene expression, and gene expression of the ensemble of genes will be applied to predict whole-plant phenotypes. As a last step, genome sequence and transcriptome data will be integrated for prediction of phenotypes and their regulators. Thus, a model for prediction that incorporates multiple layers of information will serve as a tool for prediction of plant molecular properties (e.g. gene expression), as well as growth and developmental traits. This project will make use of a large Populus deltoides association population for which abundant genome, transcriptome and phenotypic resources are already available or will be developed here. Prediction tools will also be applicable to other species for which similar type of resources are available. The research methods to be applied to each aim will consist of four components: (1) detection of large-effect factors (e.g., individual or groups of variants with large regulatory effects) using single-factor regression methods, (2) development of prediction models that combine whole-genome information from large and small-effect factors, (3) biological validation of findings using genetic modification, and (4) statistical validation using an independent population. Genotypic and gene expression data will be publically available in NCBI's dbSNP and the sequence read archive/gene expression omnibus databases (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Analysis packages will be deposited in the R Archive (http://cran.r-project.org/), and project details and plant resource access procedures will be described in the project web site (http://sfrc.ufl.edu/forestgenomics/Kirstlab/).","teal"

Understanding these changes and their consequences requires an understanding of the complex chemistry of the dissolved carbon dioxide (or carbonate) system in seawater, and the ability to accurately and precisely measure small changes in carbonate system parameters. Such measurements require specialized training and are beyond the specific expertise of many investigators who would like to pursue research related to ocean acidification. This project will support the development of a portable, automated instrument that will enable investigators with limited backgrounds in chemistry to collect high-quality carbon-system data, providing essential quantitative context for their ocean acidification research. The sensor will be a compact, relatively low-cost, robust instrument designed to collect pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity data from discrete samples, shore-based stations, and a variety of surface platforms. <br/><br/>The specific objective of this proposal is to develop a third-generation ""Multi-parameter Inorganic Carbon Analyzer"" (MICA III), which will enable straightforward measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and pH in the field. This multi-parameter sensor will be easy to operate and highly portable, with virtually no supporting infrastructure requirements. The underlying carbon system measurement protocols were previously demonstrated in the field using MICA I. DIC and pH will constitute the fundamental pairing from which other parameters (the partial pressure of CO2, TA, and carbonate ion concentration) will be calculated. An additional directly measured parameter (TA) will allow assessments of internal thermodynamic consistency among our calculated and measured properties. To enable TA measurements within a compact instrument, the investigators will use a novel equilibration design as an alternative to the standard titration methods. With this approach, they plan to substantially simplify the instrument, eliminating requirements for highly precise acid metering. State-of-the-art optical, mechanical, and electrical design software will be employed in conjunction with laboratory and field tests, using an iterative approach to develop and refine the design of MICA III over a three-year period. One of the intended impacts of this project - generating awareness of ocean acidification - will be realized in three ways. First, by developing a technology to substantially facilitate carbon-system measurements, this project will enable researchers with diverse objectives to collect and disseminate observations of the carbon system on a much larger scale. Since the proposed technology is fully consistent with best-practice protocols, results from different investigations will be directly comparable in terms of their chemical context. In turn, this will reduce uncertainties surrounding observations and interpretations. Second, the proposed activities include development of an ocean acidification discussion and technology demonstration. This discussion will be presented to students at the new Cousteau Center for Marine Studies at the Canterbury School and at the St. Petersburg Science Festival, both in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Science Festival is a locally sponsored event for the general public with attendance of about 12,000-15,000 residents. Finally, the results of this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national meetings. Field data and associated metadata collected during this effort will be submitted to the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office, which will also archive the data in the appropriate national archive facility.","lavender"

The workshops will be attended by key stakeholders from across the circumpolar nations who are interested in working together on the creation of an integrated Arctic Library Portal. This effort aims to build a unified digital access point for some of the world's largest Arctic collections, in conjunction with encouraging the initial digitization of an extensive new base of primary sources and the encouragement of more extensive scanning for efforts that may have begun, on numerous Arctic subjects that include social, economic, geographic, cultural, ethnographic, environmental, and historical topics. This effort will enable and potentially inspire increased awareness of available tools, networks and best practices that can be replicated across the Arctic and the globe. In addition, it has the potential to make large library materials available not only to academic scholars but to Arctic community members, and other members of the public many of whom have a great interest but do not possess the resources to gain access to these collections. This project supports the ""democratization"" of sources and scholarship, access for all. <br/><br/>The first workshop will bring together key archive, library and museum personnel from across the circumpolar north to not only discuss the potential for collaboration on an Arctic Library Portal but to identify the most endangered collections, e.g. deteriorating analog tapes; animal infested paper collections; fading photographs and negatives and brittle film, etc. that could be part of a phase two project for salvaging such collections. <br/><br/>The second workshop is a meeting in Boston to engage the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) and the broader academic community at Harvard, MIT, and other local universities that have been working on novel ways to categorize and integrate topical materials from widely scattered collections. This second gathering will focus on technical issues surrounding the creation of the Arctic Library Portal as well as ways to integrate this project within the expansion of a larger national digital infrastructure that has been envisioned by DPLA. New content teams in DPLA at the Boston Public Library are also framing an innovative approach to synthesizing digital content in new user-friendly formats for both specialists and the wider public, an effort that has been especially fruitful for integrating related materials by topic across a distributed platform.","plum"

This project addresses this challenge, with an emphasis on easing the burden on the user, building a solution that is sustainable over the long term, and delivering performance that scales in the number of collaborators. <br/><br/>The project's technical approach is to deploy a general-purpose storage platform, called Syndicate, that harnesses a collection of available storage components to provide a global, scalable, and secure storage service. These include public and private cloud storage (for data durability), network caches and content distribution networks (for scalable read bandwidth), and local disks (for local reads/write performance). The project's goal is to make it possible for applications to access data independent of where it is stored, where Syndicate simultaneously: (1) minimizes the operational burden imposed on users, (2) maximizes the use of commodity infrastructure; and (3) maximizes aggregate I/O performance. At its core, Syndicate's value proposition is to fully decouple storage semantics from infrastructure. This lets users select infrastructure based on its cost/performance trade-off, while ensuring that their domain-specific storage requirements are met. And to demonstrate this value, the project is building a pilot deployment that spans edge resources on nine campuses, and operating the capability on behalf of a diverse set of application domains, ranging from biology to network analytics to personalized medicine to retail and consumer analysis.","mauve"

Disease epidemics rarely end in the complete extinction of host populations. Especially in highly lethal diseases, theory predicts a shift away from the outbreak phase to a post-outbreak stage where hosts and pathogens persist in a shared environment. Such transitions in disease states present a moving target that limits the development of successful intervention strategies. This research investigates the factors that drive evolutionary shifts in disease dynamics by focusing on one of the most devastating infectious diseases of vertebrates in recorded history, amphibian chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungal pathogen that can spread rapidly through amphibian populations and cause extremely high levels of mortality, suggesting that it is a strong agent of natural selection. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators are using an in-depth understanding of chytridiomycosis to develop science-based conservation strategies. The research is integrated with educational outreach, including public workshops and presentations centered on the annual International Save the Frogs Day. <br/><br/>This research capitalizes on a decade of research in Central America and on an unprecedented archive of disease data, pathogen isolates, and host samples. Pathogen isolates and host samples were collected and archived during the outbreak phase of the disease and similar data are being collected during the endemic phase, beginning eight to ten years later. The researchers are using experimental and molecular methods to investigate the hypotheses that (1) the level of pathogen virulence has shifted since the original outbreaks and (2) that hosts have evolved to be more tolerant of infection. To test these hypotheses, the investigators are testing the historic and contemporary samples to identify phenotypic and genetic differences linked to pathogen virulence host immune defenses. The results will provide insights for safeguarding amphibian biodiversity and for understanding the role of evolution in shaping post-epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases.","salmon"

The dipole moment is our primary shield against energetic particles in the solar wind, controlling the production of cosmogenic isotopes in the upper atmosphere. Estimates of past dipole moment are used to infer cosmogenic isotope production and hence contribute to proxies for solar flux in paleoclimate studies. They also help inform us about expected hazard levels associated with space weather. The geomagnetic field exhibits large changes on a range of temporal and spatial scales, but the focus here is on the past 100 ka. Time varying representations of the field derived from paleo and archeomagnetic data reveal an overall geographic asymmetry in field structure for the past 10 ky with stronger average fields in the northern hemisphere and more active secular variation in the southern hemisphere. There is a long-term increase in the dipole from about 6000 BC until 300 AD, and one interval exhibiting particularly strong growth corresponds to the rapid appearance of regional spikes in field strength in the Levantine region. Since 300 AD the axial dipole strength has generally declined from its peak of around 120 ZAm2 to the present day value near 80 ZAm2. The regional extent and impact of the Levantine field spikes has yet to be fully elucidated, and it remains an open question whether similar features occur at other places and times. This proposal has two major goals. The first is to explore the relationship between spike-like behavior, dipole growth, and other field properties. The second is to understand changes that lead to intervals of decreasing dipole moment as is happening today and occurred in more dramatic form during the Laschamp excursion centered about 41 ka. Results will contribute to numerous areas where general or specific knowledge is needed about the geomagnetic field and its variability on centennial to million year time scales. Systematic electronic archiving of tools and products in the EarthRef Digital Archive community database will make them useful to other US and international researchers in geo- and paleo-magnetism, and for research and educational purposes at multiple levels. This project will enhance future STEM activities and research through mentoring and training of both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>Part 2: Careful analysis of data uncertainties and improvements in inversion strategies have resulted in greatly improved time varying global spherical harmonic paleomagnetic field models over the time spans from 0-10 ka and 0-100 ka, These models are limited in local temporal and spatial complexity, and do not capture the full complexity of features such as the Levantine spike. However, robust features in the results indicate they can be used as the basis for hypothesis testing about the dynamic structural evolution of the magnetic field. Assuming flux spikes originate as small scale but large amplitude changes at the core-mantle boundary allows quantification of the spatial extent over which changes should be visible at Earth's surface. Paleofield models for 0-10 ka and 0-100 ka will be used to explore two periods of change in geomagnetic dipole moment: (i) the dipole moment decay and subsequent recovery in a period of 20 ky surrounding the Laschamp excursion, and (ii) growth in dipole moment from about 6000 BC to 300 AD and transition to the decay seen in the present field.","hot_pink"

As populations stop speaking them, languages, especially unwritten ones, become even more fragile than physical sites and all knowledge held within may easily be lost. This is true of endangered languages all over the world including Kawaiisu, a Uto-Aztecan language of Kern County, California, where just two Native American elder speakers remain. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. This project will involve a linguist, Kawaiisu second language speakers, and the elder speakers to transcribe, translate, and analyze recordings covering fifty years of Kawaiisu speech. The broader impacts of this include broadening participation as Native American citizen scientists research their heritage language, as well as the implementation of an exemplary partnership between academic linguists and Native American communities. The resulting analyzed Kawaiisu materials will be publicly accessible and will generate data of scholarly interest to linguists and to other disciplines that depend on language-related material (i.e., anthropology, history, geography) in their research.<br/><br/><br/>Fortunately, technology has left a record of the sounds of Kawaiisu. The oldest audio recordings, made in 1958 by Sheldon Klein, clearly present the cadence, sounds, and linguistic patterns of 60 years ago, when Kawaiisu was in more regular use. Later Klein recordings from the 1980s are the bridge between these older ways of speaking and later usage in fluent conversations video-recorded at culturally significant sites by the Kawaiisu Language and Cultural Center between 2011 and 2015. Less than 10 percent have been translated. Kawaiisu is Uto-Aztecan language family, which has played an important role in many areas of linguistics, including linguistic classification, historical reconstruction, typology and theoretical linguistics. Despite this importance, there are still many questions about the family, including Kawaiisu and its place in the Numic branch of the family. This project will augment scientific knowledge of Kawaiisu and its relatives.<br/><br/><br/>Researchers will investigate language change via this newly annotated documentation. The conversational data spans a critical period in history when major shifts were occurring within indigenous communities, as well as throughout California and the United States. The involvement of Kawaiisu team members ensures that the knowledge gained will remain with the community as they mobilize data in their linguistic and cultural revitalization programs. Recordings and transcriptions will be archived at the California Language Archive at the University of California, Berkeley, where they will be accessible to other researchers and the general public.","maroon"

The current project contributes to this goal by thoroughly documenting two neighboring related languages, Matngele and MalakMalak, spoken in remote northern Australia.<br/><br/>Lenore Grenoble and Dorothea Hoffman, experienced language documenters from the University of Chicago, will create an annotated database which will include indigenous historical and personal narratives, natural conversation, and data from targeted elicitation.

In these narratives, landscape features are inherent elements of the grammar and are expressed in substantial uses of deictic and spatial determiners, coverbs, and suffixes. The very structure of the narratives is determined by spatial ordering and the use of motion descriptions at episode boundaries. MalakMalak and Matngele narratives and other spontaneous speech samples are also excellent sources of data for optional ergative/absolutive case-marking syntactic structure that is governed by prosody, information structure, and discourse environment. Similarly, one finds information on complex predicates whose ordering is not fixed but also potentially determined by information structure. There are also a small number of optional noun classifiers whose usage is subject to discourse constraints. <br/><br/>Finally, the two tribes of MalakMalak and Matngele have been in close cultural and linguistic contact for a long time. Unique storytelling techniques and bilingualism in this setting offer exceptional insight into language and literary contact in a highly diverse multilingual and multicultural setting.<br/><br/>By involving, speakers, local schools, and adults no longer actively speaking the languages, the proposed project may be able to encourage revitalization processes of both languages.

The network is expected to result in collaborations on methodological and data quality issues, new research on employment distributions and discrimination, organizational population dynamics, and new opportunities for researchers in multiple scientific areas. <br/><br/>The research network will also create a metadata repository to reduce the barriers to entry for researchers, as well as to open up the use of data in creative ways. Currently, data access restrictions limit the formation of collaborative research networks among scientists. Researchers new to the data typically invent (or reinvent) data management, measurement, and sampling protocols. As a result replication is rare and research programs are individual rather than collective. The project will create a virtual metadata repository to insure that current published work and non-confidential data products are broadly disseminated to the scientific community. The project will also develop plans for the creation of a permanent data archive and research portal to preserve and magnify these scientific synergies. Together the network and virtual metadata repository will generate new connections across currently siloed research communities and will connect the data to entirely new areas of scientific research. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/>The core contribution of research using the EEOC data is to further our understanding of gender, racial, ethnic, religious, age, disability and sexual orientation employment integration and discrimination. This will be accomplished by encouraging scientific exploration and making data more accessible to both the scientific community and to the public. The broadest impact of the project will be to enhance the public's and policymakers' understanding of the societal and organization processes which lead to diverse workplaces and reductions in discrimination and inequality.","aquamarine"

These workshops enable 80 faculty, selected on the basis of proposals for tractable projects examining differential gene expression or transcriptome sequencing, to develop good data sets and curriculum plans. Data analysis utilizesboth the student-oriented Green Line of the DNA Subway (www.dnasubway.org) and the research-grade tools available at the iPlant Collaborative (www.iplantcollaborative.org), which use high performance computing resources of NSF's Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (www.xsede.org). The training is designed to transition from in-person workshops to online webinars and self-paced learning in year three. Development of a multi-faceted assessment of impacts on students and faculty is in process.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Bringing next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and data analysis into the undergraduate classroom has the potential to transform biology teaching nation-wide. This project specifically enables one such approach, RNA-seq, which makes possible dynamic experiments to assess utilization of genomes. The goal is to enable faculty at small and/or primarily undergraduate institutions - those that do not have access to a DNA sequencer, a supercomputer, or an experienced bioinformatician - to generate and/or utilize NGS datasets in the college classroom and to invite students [to be] co-investigators in the exploration of eukaryotic genomes.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: Attention is being paid to including faculty from a variety of institutions; about 25% of the faculty are being recruited from minority-serving institutions. The aim of the proposal is to further extend the egalitarian nature of genome research. All curriculum materials are being made freely available; primary sequence data will be archived in the NCBI-SRA (National Center for Biotechnology Information-Sequence Read Archive) and in the iPlant Data Store.

The goal of this project is to associate genome-wide diversity to functional plant phenotypes using high-throughput phenotyping under field conditions and new analytical tools in balsam poplar, Populus balsamifera, a keystone tree species. This project will provide cross-disciplinary training in the latest techniques in ecological genomics, remote sensing, and spatial modeling to undergraduate and graduate students. Minority and first-generation undergraduate students will be recruited through partnerships with Frostburg State University's McNair Program and other organizations. Public outreach to rural communities will be conducted through a multi-faceted science program centered on engaging the public in the science of genomics, plant phenology, and climate change, in collaboration with the National Phenology Network (www.usanpn.org/). <br/><br/>This project will develop and integrate tools from genomics, remote sensing, and geospatial modeling to study the genetic basis of climate adaptation in Populus balsamifera, balsam poplar. Sampling will be focused on balsam poplar's southern range edge in order to study the physiological adaptations of populations to the warmest, earliest onset growing seasons within its geographic range. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data will be generated for 600 poplar genotypes and used to perform genome scans for local adaptation and association mapping for phenology, growth, and water use efficiency traits. Regions of the genome associated with climate adaptation will be used to predict field performance using an independent sample of genotypes and an innovative remote sensing approach to measure phenology. New spatial analytical methods will be developed to characterize the associations between genomic variation and environmental gradients of climate and growing season length, and to visualize the landscape surface of adaptive variation under both current and projected climates. Genomic sequence data will be publically available through NCBI's sequence read archive and DOE's Knowledgebase. SNP genotypes, phenotypic traits, and remotely sensed phenology data will be publically accessible through Data DRYAD (www.datadryad.org).

Such a view, implemented as an integrated archive, consolidates temporal information from different data sources and creates significant added value by making explicit the times when facts about the entities are true. The task of creating an integrated archive remains non-trivial even with the state-of-the-art data integration techniques. This is a high-risk research project that targets challenging problems in the nexus of several research areas: data exchange, temporal databases, conflict resolution and data inconsistency. This project has the potential to make significant societal impact through the development of a foundational framework that facilitates the process of consolidating temporal data from different heterogeneous temporal data sources. It is anticipated that the availability of such a platform will lead to new classes of applications, particularly those involving profiling, tracking, monitoring, and understanding of the evolution of entities over time. This project will involve the research and training of graduate and undergraduate students in science and engineering, including members of groups underrepresented in computer science, in pertinent areas of data integration. Results obtained from this investigation will be incorporated into advanced graduate data management courses on large-scale data integration that will be developed and taught at both SUNY at Buffalo and UC Santa Cruz. Selected material from the outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into upper-division undergraduate database courses taught at both universities. <br/><br/>This proposal will develop formal foundations and principled solutions to the problems of exchanging temporal data (i.e., transformations of temporal data from one format into another) and resolving conflicts of temporal data. The unique challenge in managing temporal data that underlies all aspects of this proposal is the management of the discrepancy between the abstract declarative view of temporal data and its corresponding concrete implementation view. The general approach adopted by this proposal will be two-tiered: data exchange and conflict resolution over temporal data are declaratively specified using the declarative point-based view, while computational tasks required to exchange data and resolve conflicts manipulate the underlying time intervals. Results from this investigation will also lay the groundwork for longer-term research such as answering queries over inconsistent temporal databases.

The Cariban languages, which constitute one of the largest linguistic families of South America, are a good testing ground for this expectation since closely related Cariban languages often show dissimilar changes.<br/><br/>Spike Gildea of the University of Oregon along with linguist Natalia Cï¿½ceres and lexicographer Marie-Claude Mattei Muller will document a critically endangered Cariban language Yawarana [yar]. Extant data for Yawarana show surprising phonological differences (e.g., syllable reduction, stress) with closely related languages, Mapoyo and 'Pï¿½mono. In addition, there are dramatic differences in morphosyntax (e.g., case alignment, verbal conjugations) between Yawarana, Mapoyo, and 'Pï¿½mono and their Cariban neighbors Panare, 'Tamanaku, and Ye'kwana. Particularly striking are differences between main clause verb forms resulting from nominalizations (like English 'eating' or 'eater' based on 'eat') or a participial (like English 'eaten' based on 'eat'). All languages change, and some entirely replace verb conjugations with nominalizations and participles, but it is unusual for a language or language group to have made so complete a change when the nearest related languages have not.<br/><br/>To investigate these and additional grammatical features of Yawarana, this team will work with the last speakers of the language to produce a state-of-the-art documentary corpus, including audio and video recordings of Yawarana speech with annotations and analysis of speech samples. The final products will include a reference grammar and a Yawarana-Spanish bilingual dictionary. The resulting data will elucidate the nature of language change in Cariban and will have implications for theories of language change.<br/><br/>Gildea and his team will collaborate with the Venezuelan Ministry of Education in their efforts to produce educational materials about the Yawarana language for use in speech community schools. The documentary corpus created for this project will be archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Languages of Latin America (University of Texas).<br/><br/>The project is supported by co-funds from the National Science Foundation's International Science and Engineering Office.","maroon"

The AMNH has one of the largest primate collections in the world, including over 10,000 specimens collected on dozens of museum expeditions to South America, Africa, and Asia. The AMNH collection preserves host specimens from large field surveys of scientifically important microbes and parasites and is an archive of biological diversity in many formerly pristine landscapes subsequently altered by human activities. This collection is a national resource for training undergraduate, graduate-student, and postdoctoral researchers from the United States and abroad. Primates are also studied by anthropologists for clues about human evolution, and primate research is also important for understanding the origins of human diseases (like AIDS and malaria), which are caused by microbes that evolved in monkeys and apes. Additionally, the collection is often used as a basis for illustrations in field guides used by the public. Specimens for public exhibits are viewed by millions of museum-goers every year. <br/><br/>This award will contribute to the long-term research and societal value of the AMNH primate collection by protecting vulnerable specimens on archival substrates in new dust- and insect-proof cabinetry, cleaning and repairing specimens, decompressing and reorganizing the collection, georeferencing, and improving data quality. Currently, much of this collection is stored in old cabinets, where skins are discolored by dust and urban soot and at risk from insect pests. AMNH houses one of the largest and most heavily used mammal collections in the world. On average, more than 200 unaffiliated researchers visit the AMNH mammal collection every year, the AMNH Department of Mammalogy loans about 1800 specimens annually to researchers at other institutions, and an online collection database provides access to specimen data. Primates comprise a uniquely important part of the mammal collection. Primate researchers account for more than 40 percent of total visitor activity in the Department of Mammalogy and account for a substantial fraction of publications based on AMNH mammals. Traditional museum research with this material has produced hundreds of scientific publications over the last 100 years, and new technologies (such as CT scanning and 3D laser-imaging) allow modern researchers to use AMNH primate specimens for a wide range of non-traditional research purposes. A professionally produced video posted on the AMNH main website and its YouTube channel (the latter with more than 41,000 subscribers and millions of annual visitors) will serve to educate viewers about these important functions and about the challenges of museum specimen conservation.","puce"

Modern solid-state physics explains the physical properties of numerous materials, such as traditional metals, semiconductors, and insulators which provide the basis of our modern technological society. But materials with electrons derived from d- and f-electron shells tend to fall outside the scope of this theory and have remarkable properties.

Like other Northeast U.S. forests, the Ca cycle was significantly perturbed by acid deposition beginning in the early 1950's resulting in increased Ca loss from bio-available soil pools and detrimental effects on forest growth. Additionally, several of the first order watersheds at HBEF have been experimentally logged allowing examination of the relationship between harvesting, Ca cycling and forest ecology. Research will address the following questions: How do the Ca isotope ratios of streamwater and soil change in response to disturbances including acidification and deforestation? What can such data tell us about the mechanisms of Ca loss from forest ecosystems and changes in Ca cycling resulting from disturbance? An isotope-tracer box model indicates that soil and streamwater Ca isotopes reflect the relative magnitudes of important fluxes in the forest Ca cycle (external supply, plant uptake, and recycling to soil), leading to a series of testable hypotheses related to the ecosystem-level response to these perturbations. The main hypothesis is that forest growth will take up Ca, limiting it's input to streamwater, while deforestation will increase streamwater Ca as runoff from soil. To address questions and hypotheses, Ca isotope ratios and elemental concentrations will be determined on a carefully selected group of archived soil parent material, precipitation, streamwater, soil, and vegetation samples.<br/><br/>Ca biogeochemistry has important implications for forest sustainability, both in the NE US, Northern Europe, and China. Ca isotopes, like other tracers of Ca cycling, has the potential to resolve some of the uncertainties in the sources of Ca loss from forests that are not apparent from mass balance studies alone. This information is important beyond biogeochemical research, with implications for forest management and regionally important agribusiness, such as maple syrup production. This project will primarily support a graduate student in Boston University's new Terrestrial Biogeosciences PhD program. The graduate student and the PI will create modules for use by a future year's cohort of GLACIER graduate students that introduce middle school students to New England biogeochemistry, acid rain, and forest sustainability. The results of this project will further be communicated to the about 300 students at Boston University and Tufts that the PI teaches annually.","hot_pink"

When there is an imbalance within a community, this can lead to severe effects, such as disease in the human gut or the inability for plants to grow efficiently in soil. An understanding of the composition and interplay within the communities allows us to potentially manipulate them. Metagenomics is the study of these different micro-organism communities, which is achieved by isolating the DNA from the organisms within an environmental sample (e.g. water, soil, animal stool), sequencing the DNA, followed by the computational analysis to decode which organisms are present and the functions they might be performing. This computation is complicated: 1) there is a huge amount of data; 2) The sequence data is a jumbled mix of fragments from different organisms; 3) Decoding the DNA is hard - typically >90% of organisms within a sample are not well characterized. This proposal brings together three major resources within the field of metagenomics data archiving and analysis. The most immediate beneficiaries of the outputs from this proposal and associated resources will be the scientists worldwide who are involved in metagenomics research. This diverse, extensive and expanding community includes (but is not limited to) microbiologists interested in understanding microbial community structure and interactions, biochemists aiming to discover new proteins with functional applications, and clinicians seeking to investigate and modulate the microbial communities associated with healthy or diseased states. <br/><br/>The European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is a repository of DNA sequence data. Importantly, ENA also captures metagenomic contextual data, such as where and when the sample was taken, how the DNA was extracted and sequenced. The EBI metagenomics portal (EMG,UK) and MG-RAST (MGR,US) are 2 metagenomics sequence analysis platforms. The aim of this project is to initiate a long-term collaboration between the EMG and MGR platforms to build and operate a comprehensive data exchange system, the Metagenomics Exchange (ME). This resource will ensure that metagenomic sequence reads, derived data and associated metadata are permanently preserved and made available for the broadest future use. Crucially, it will ensure that these scientists can discover and mine pre-processed datasets and compare their analysis across varying platforms. There will no longer be the time consuming need for exhaustive searching of ENA, MG-RAST (MGR) and EBI metagenomics (EMG) to discover data, nor will there be the need to submit to both MGR and EMG-the cross submission will simply happen automatically. Furthermore, as a result of the work to make MG-RAST and EMG?s pipelines interoperable, scientists will have access to enhanced analyses that utilize a common set of parameters and allow mixing and matching of pipeline components to suit the data that is being processed, improving and enriching their analysis results.

Both groups will directly benefit from the collection of new Tlingit language data, given the language's status as highly endangered. In addition, study of the specific linguistic phenomena identified in this project will make distinct, important contributions to diverse areas of linguistic theory. For example, the investigation of word-order and sentence structure in Tlingit is expected to establish for linguists the existence of 'covert A-scrambling', a grammatical process whose existence is predicted by theory, but which has thus far not been definitively documented. Furthermore, study of the grammatical means by which Tlingit expresses the concepts of time and possibility will inform specific debates surrounding the extent to which languages vary in the expression of these concepts, thus probing deep and long-standing questions relating to human nature and the structure of human cognition.<br/><br/>Beyond these technical results, this project will advance ongoing efforts to document, maintain and revitalize the growing number of endangered languages throughout the world, mitigating the inevitable and catastrophic language death that will occur by the end of this century. This project will uncover subtle grammatical generalizations of no small importance to the growing number of persons learning Tlingit as a second language. Moreover, the digital recordings and field reports made during this project will be added to the archives stored at the Sealaska Heritage Institute and the Alaska Native Language Archive, preserving for future Tlingit generations the voices and the words of their forebears.","maroon"

A goal of the Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet) is to add 50 new semi-permanently monumented, continuously operating, Global Positioning Satellite (cGPS) stations spanning multiple Caribbean and Caribbean bordering nations. COCONet goals also call for the integration of GPS data from up to 50 existing stations operating in the Caribbean. The new cGPS stations will, in some cases, be co-located with existing tide gauges, thus supporting studies of sea level change in response to current global warming, and will be mated with surface meteorological observational equipment (Metpacks) to significantly expand spatiotemporal geodetic and atmospheric observational infrastructure in a region of complex tectonics with substantial earthquake, tsunami, volcanic, tropical storm and hurricane, flooding and landslide hazards. COCONet will provide a backbone fiducial and meteorologic observational network and COCONet data and data products that will be freely available through the UNAVCO archive will be available to serve a broad range of basic tectonic and atmospheric research investigations and enable observations of immediate relevance for advancing understanding, mitigating and perhaps predicting regional geohazards. Some specific questions that COCONet data could help to address include: 1) How rigid is the Caribbean plate?; 2) What are the slip rates along active faults that bound the Caribbean plate?; 3) How is stress released at convergent plate boundaries and how is stress transferred across plate boundaries?; and 4) How can we better understand and assess hazards in the Caribbean and Central American regions? Atmospheric questions that could be advanced by proposed GPS meteorological determinations and surface measurements of atmospheric physical properties include: 1) How sensitive is tropospheric water vapor content to changes in sea surface temperatures?; and 2) How does the distribution of precipitable water vapor across the Caribbean region influence the genesis, intensification and vectoring of tropical storms and hurricanes? <br/><br/>COCONet data will flow via the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) data management system and be available via the Web-accessible UNAVCO data archive. Low-latency data telemetry will be via cellular modem or through VSAT satellite communications to the PBO Network Operations Center in Boulder, Colorado. These data will be processed into derived geodetic products, including combined GPS station position and velocity estimates, simplified position time series and velocity field estimates in multiple formats, at the existing PBO GPS Analysis Centers at Central Washington University and New Mexico Tech and the Analysis Center Coordinator at MIT. In addition, UCAR will estimate tropospheric precipitable water vapor (PV) every 30 minutes from observations of GPS radio frequency signal propagation delays along the path length between the satellite transmitter and the receiver coupled with concurrent surface measurement of barometric pressure. The PV observations will feed into operational numerical weather models run several times per day. <br/><br/>The project will engage Caribbean researchers, their students and governmental agency representatives with the goal of empowering these nations to utilize COCONet data for both scientific and socioeconomic purposes. Real-time data from COCONet will be made available to the International GNSS Service (IGS) to help densify GPS observations in a region of the globe with few existing real-time data streams and thereby improve GPS satellite orbit calculations and help to refine the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF).","hot_pink"

Understanding these changes and their consequences requires an understanding of the complex chemistry of the dissolved carbon dioxide (or carbonate) system in seawater, and the ability to accurately and precisely measure small changes in carbonate system parameters. Such measurements require specialized training and are beyond the specific expertise of many investigators who would like to pursue research related to ocean acidification. This project will support the development of a portable, automated instrument that will enable investigators with limited backgrounds in chemistry to collect high-quality carbon-system data, providing essential quantitative context for their ocean acidification research. The sensor will be a compact, relatively low-cost, robust instrument designed to collect pH, total dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity data from discrete samples, shore-based stations, and a variety of surface platforms. <br/><br/>The specific objective of this proposal is to develop a third-generation ""Multi-parameter Inorganic Carbon Analyzer"" (MICA III), which will enable straightforward measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), total alkalinity (TA), and pH in the field. This multi-parameter sensor will be easy to operate and highly portable, with virtually no supporting infrastructure requirements. The underlying carbon system measurement protocols were previously demonstrated in the field using MICA I. DIC and pH will constitute the fundamental pairing from which other parameters (the partial pressure of CO2, TA, and carbonate ion concentration) will be calculated. An additional directly measured parameter (TA) will allow assessments of internal thermodynamic consistency among our calculated and measured properties. To enable TA measurements within a compact instrument, the investigators will use a novel equilibration design as an alternative to the standard titration methods. With this approach, they plan to substantially simplify the instrument, eliminating requirements for highly precise acid metering. State-of-the-art optical, mechanical, and electrical design software will be employed in conjunction with laboratory and field tests, using an iterative approach to develop and refine the design of MICA III over a three-year period. One of the intended impacts of this project - generating awareness of ocean acidification - will be realized in three ways. First, by developing a technology to substantially facilitate carbon-system measurements, this project will enable researchers with diverse objectives to collect and disseminate observations of the carbon system on a much larger scale. Since the proposed technology is fully consistent with best-practice protocols, results from different investigations will be directly comparable in terms of their chemical context. In turn, this will reduce uncertainties surrounding observations and interpretations. Second, the proposed activities include development of an ocean acidification discussion and technology demonstration. This discussion will be presented to students at the new Cousteau Center for Marine Studies at the Canterbury School and at the St. Petersburg Science Festival, both in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Science Festival is a locally sponsored event for the general public with attendance of about 12,000-15,000 residents. Finally, the results of this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national meetings. Field data and associated metadata collected during this effort will be submitted to the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office, which will also archive the data in the appropriate national archive facility.","lavender"

As part of ECR, this project is funded by the Research on Gender in Science and Engineering (GSE) program. GSE seeks to understand and address gender-based differences in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and workforce participation through education and implementation research that will lead to a larger and more diverse domestic STEM workforce. The proposed research will support the survey and synthesis of the social, educational, and behavioral science literatures regarding the relationship of K-12 diversity to STEM outcomes in two and four-year colleges. Findings from the resulting narrative syntheses, vote-counting and meta-regression analyses will contribute to enhancing the educational infrastructure necessary to diminish gaps in US students' STEM performance and developing a globally competitive STEM workforce. Gaining insight into trajectories to college STEM success among underserved populations is particularly important because youths from these backgrounds continue to lag in their participation in STEM and they are growing as a percent of the US student population. The results of these syntheses will promote learning in STEM, the narrowing of many extant K-16 gaps in STEM outcomes, the improvement of articulation agreements between community colleges and four-year institutions so that transfer students are more likely to succeed in STEM once they matriculate to the latter, and the preparation of students as productive workers in the globalizing economy. It will also stimulate future research by developing a theoretical model of K-12 diversity's mechanisms with respect to two- and four-year college STEM outcomes.<br/><br/>Most basic research and policy studies about college STEM outcomes investigate the roles of student, family, and teacher characteristics, or the influences of pedagogy and curricula on STEM outcomes. This study will focus on the organizational characteristics of K-12 schools and classrooms in conjunction with the former set of factors. The syntheses have the potential to illuminate the relationship of variations in organizational characteristics of K-12 schools on college STEM outcomes, especially among underserved student populations. First, the syntheses will summarize the relationship of race/ethnic, socio-economic status, and immigrant diversity in K-12 schools and classrooms to STEM outcomes in higher education, paying attention to variations in the relationships by student subpopulations. Second, the researchers will investigate higher education outcomes at both two- and four-year institutions, and the transitions to them, and thereby capture the dynamics of the full STEM educational pipeline, particularly given the critical role of community college transfer options for underserved college students. The focus on two-year institutions is important due to the growing interest in how community colleges can contribute to creating a larger pool of STEM workers. Third, the study will identify and synthesize research about populations currently insufficiently discussed in the literature: Latinos/as, Asians, immigrants, and low-income students. Fourth, the syntheses will permit the development of a much-needed testable theoretical model that accounts for school and classroom compositional effects on STEM outcomes in two- and four-year colleges for all student populations. Finally, the results of this project will be a public resource that could contribute to the advancement of STEM teaching, learning, and participation, through the Spivack Archive, an extant searchable electronic database that presently holds abstracts of 550 research studies about the relationship of K-12 socio-economic status and racial composition to K-12 outcomes. The award will enable the researchers to add studies of higher education outcomes related to STEM to this archive.","azure"

Research products will include a linguistically annotated database, a reference grammar for Desano, audio and video documentation and preliminary description of Siriano. Silva's research will be useful in reconstructing the genetic relationship among languages of the Vaupï¿½s Linguistic Area to which Desano and Siriano belong. Understanding the structures of these closely related languages of the Eastern Tukanoan branch of the Tukanoan family will shed light on the nature of language change through contact with other languages.<br/><br/>This project has strong support from the communities and their leaders, and involves close collaboration between researchers and community members in Colombia and Brazil where these languages are spoken. The corpus of audiovisual and audio recordings collected as a result of this research will be archived at the Archive of the Indigenous Language of Latin America at the University of Texas at Austin and at the Museum of the Indian at National Foundation of the Indian (Museu do ï¿½ndio at the Fundaï¿½ï¿½o Nacional do ï¿½ndio), Brazil.","maroon"

The most evident symptom and important consequence of Al toxicity is root growth inhibition on acidic soils. A prominent example is barley, which is one of the most important crops in temperate regions including Europe and North America. Barley is very sensitive to Al toxicity and yield losses of up to 30% have been associated with growth in acidic soils. It has been previously argued that Al toxicity was an intractable problem due to its apparent complexity. The goal of this project is to define the biochemical mechanism that underlies inhibition of root growth in Arabidopsis and barley following chronic exposure to Al. It is the expectation that an inclusive understanding of this novel process will enable the development of agricultural crop plants that can grow and thrive in the presence of Al. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide research training opportunities for a diverse group of high school, undergraduate and graduate students from a range of ethnic and social backgrounds. Student training will be enhanced by international research exchanges and collaborations with colleagues from Belgium, Germany and Poland who lead the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project entitled ""Towards a molecular understanding of aluminium genotoxicity for crop improvement (Al-UCIDATE)"". Finally, the project will provide a summer research training internship for a local high school teacher from a local school district that serves a significant Hispanic student population.<br/><br/>Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. When found in acidic environments, Al converts to the highly toxic Al3+ form. While the mechanisms of Al exclusion from plants are relatively simple, little is known about the biochemical basis of Al toxicity and why Al leads to severe root growth inhibition with profound effects on yield. Recent work in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that Al may act as a genotoxic agent, with DNA damage caused by Al triggering a cell cycle checkpoint pathway that is regulated largely by the cell cycle checkpoint factor Ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR). Specifically, mutations in ATR appear to confer substantial Al tolerance to the plant by suppressing cell cycle progression which forces terminal differentiation of the root in response to Al. The finding that Al acts as a DNA-stress inducing compound represents a new perspective on Al toxicity that bears further investigation. The goal of this project is to study this novel effect of Al on root growth in barley and Arabidopsis using a combination of transcriptomic, phylogenetic, genomic and phenotypic analyses. By developing a model by which root growth is halted following chronic exposure to Al, it is anticipated that the information will enable the exploitation of checkpoint control to confer Al tolerance to economically important crop plants. All data and resources generated through this project will be publicly accessible. Genome, sequence, and proteome datasets will be accessible through a consortium website and through publicly available data repositories that include ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) and the PRIDE Archive (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) for proteomics data. Biological materials (seeds, plasmids, etc.) will be made available upon request. Seeds of key lines will also be deposited at and disseminated through the appropriate stock centers such as the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) and Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC) for Arabidopsis lines.","teal"

By the end of the grant period, the TA will extend across the entire US and the proposed research will produce a synoptic view of the seismic and thermal structure of the North American continent. The primary focus is to construct 3D models of radial and azimuthal anisotropy in the crust and uppermost mantle across the contiguous United States using surface waves extracted from ambient noise and earthquake data as well as receiver functions. Thermal modeling of isotropic velocities via thermodynamically constrained inversions will allow estimates of uppermost mantle temperature, mantle heat flux, and the thickness of the thermal lithosphere across the continent. All inversions leverage recent advances in surface wave tomography methods (e.g., eikonal and Helmholtz tomography) to improve the fidelity of estimated wave speeds. A key component of this work is the estimation of uncertainties using Monte Carlo and related Bayesian statistics from primary measurements to the final seismological models.<br/>The proposed research possesses a substantial technical component, involving the application of recently developed methods of seismic data processing and tomography to USArray TA data observed between 2011 and 2015. The scientific motivations, however, are (1) to improve understanding of crustal and uppermost mantle anisotropy, which holds the key to knowledge of the deformation undergone by the continent and the vertical distribution of mechanical coupling in the crust and uppermost mantle, and (2) to illuminate the thermal state of the uppermost mantle. Ambient noise provides unique sensitivity to crustal structure and the ability to separate crustal from mantle anisotropy. The introduction of receiver function data further improves the vertical resolution of the model. Thermodynamically constrained inversions promise new information on the thermal state of the uppermost mantle across the entire contiguous US.<br/><br/>The seismological models and the data used to construct them will be archived and shared with the broader geoscience community. A collaboration with the IRIS-DMS has allowed the DMC to archive and distribute ambient noise cross-correlations and continued development of similar products is envisioned. Higher level data products such as dispersion maps, 3-D models, receiver functions, and research codes are delivered to the general public through dynamically updated, internet-accessible databases at CU-Boulder: http://ciei.colorado.edu/ritzwoller_m. The proposal will support two PhD graduate students. Finally, the PI is collaborating with the USGS to use the 3-D models from CU-Boulder to improve location capabilities for small earthquakes across the US. The proposed research will allow these improvements to extend into the central and eastern US where the proposed research will construct a high resolution 3-D model of the crust and uppermost mantle, providing a lasting element to the legacy of the USArray TA.","hot_pink"

The Science Coordination Office (SCO) was established to represent the research community and facilitates the project by working with support organizations responsible for logistics, drilling, and core curation. During the last five years, 26 projects have been individually funded to work on this effort and 1,511 m of the total 3,470 m of ice at the site has been collected. This proposal seeks funding to continue the SCO and related field operations needed to complete the WAIS Divide ice core project. Tasks for the SCO during the second five years include planning and oversight of logistics, drilling, and core curation; coordinating research activities in the field; assisting in curation of the core in the field; allocating samples to individual projects; coordinating the sampling effort; collecting, archiving, and distributing data and other information about the project; hosting an annual science meeting; and facilitating collaborative efforts among the research groups. The intellectual merit of the WAIS Divide project is to better predict how human-caused increases in greenhouse gases will alter climate requires an improved understanding of how previous natural changes in greenhouse gases influenced climate in the past. Information on previous climate changes is used to validate the physics and results of climate models that are used to predict future climate. Antarctic ice cores are the only source of samples of the paleo-atmosphere that can be used to determine previous concentrations of carbon dioxide. Ice cores also contain records of other components of the climate system such as the paleo air and ocean temperature, atmospheric loading of aerosols, and indicators of atmospheric transport. The WAIS Divide ice core project has been designed to obtain the best possible record of greenhouse gases during the last glacial cycle (last ~100,000 years). The site was selected because it has the best balance of high annual snowfall (23 cm of ice equivalent/year), low dust Antarctic ice that does not compromise the carbon dioxide record, and favorable glaciology. The main science objectives of the project are to investigate climate forcing by greenhouse gases, initiation of climate changes, stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and cryobiology in the ice core. The project has numerous broader impacts. An established provider of educational material (Teachers? Domain) will develop and distribute web-based resources related to the project and climate change for use in K?12 classrooms. These resources will consist of video and interactive graphics that explain how and why ice cores are collected, and what they tell us about future climate change. Members of the national media will be included in the field team and the SCO will assist in presenting information to the general public. Video of the project will be collected and made available for general use. Finally, an opportunity will be created for cryosphere students and early career scientists to participate in field activities and core analysis. An ice core archive will be available for future projects and scientific discoveries from the project can be used by policy makers to make informed decisions.","plum"

The intent is to broaden student appreciation for and interest in the field, while also strengthening them technically. Typically most of the field's major directions are represented in the lectures: hot and cold nuclear matter, electromagnetic physics, weak interactions, astrophysics, and nuclear structure. Advanced graduate students and beginning postdoctoral researchers are the target audience. School organizers are charged with identifying outstanding lecturers from theory and experiment, conducting the school in a manner that encourages discussion and interaction, and developing supporting materials, including an online archive of lectures that can serve as a long-term reference for participating students and for others who are interested in the current status of nuclear physics. School organizers are assisted by the Principal Investigators and by a Steering Committee appointed by the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.<br/><br/>The school is often the first opportunity for students to recognize the breadth of nuclear physics and to interact across subfields. Thus, it plays an important role in building a nuclear physics community. Student morale is enhanced by this opportunity and by the chance to meet with some of the field's leading researchers. The school allows students from under-represented groups to network with their peers. Students leave the school with stronger backgrounds in nuclear physics, and with new knowledge of their chosen specialties. As the lectures are preserved in an on-line archive, the students can return to this material when a need arises during their subsequent training and research. Students are given a chance to present talks and thus to gain experience in making presentations to a diverse audience.","forest_green"

Massive corals are one such geologic archive. Strontium-to-calcium elemental ratios (Sr/Ca) in coral skeletons are influenced by the temperature of the water in which the coral grew. This relationship, combined with the relatively fast growth rates and long life-span of some corals, enables scientists to reconstruct centuries-long records of tropical ocean temperatures from coral geochemistry. A major assumption underlying coral Sr/Ca-based temperature reconstructions is that the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater is the same everywhere in the ocean and is constant over at least the time period spanned by the coral record. However, there are processes that may cause variations in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater, especially in shallow coastal areas where corals grow. This research investigates the magnitude of seawater Sr/Ca fluctuations over time and space in different coral reef settings using an analytical method that will be developed for rapid, inexpensive seawater Sr/Ca determinations. The method is designed to enable seawater Sr/Ca measurements to be a routine part of coral paleoclimate sample collection. The anticipated findings will enable valuable recommendations to the scientific community regarding site selection criteria and seawater sampling for future coral Sr/Ca-based paleoclimate research and should ultimately lead to greater accuracy and reliability of this important scientific tool.<br/><br/>The project will include substantial efforts to communicate the research to lay audiences. With help from the University of Maryland's Chesapeake Biological Laboratory (CBL) outreach coordinator, a secondary school teacher will be invited to participate in a field expedition. Both of these educational specialists will work with the project Principle Investigators to maintain a blog, create a video journal, and develop/disseminate a lesson plan compatible with new curriculum standards and used in the classroom as well as in educational activities of the CBL Visitor Center. By sharing the science with teachers, their students, and Visitor Center volunteer staff and patrons, the project participants will engage citizens in the local community as well as the nearly 2700 tourists that enjoy the Visitor Center annually. <br/><br/>The scientific approach will be to conduct a spatially and temporally intensive study of seawater Sr/Ca ratios and other associated variables on fringing reefs in three physiographic settings: a continental-scale carbonate platform (Florida Keys), a small siliciclastic island (St. John, US Virgin Islands) and a small carbonate island (Anegada, British Virgin Islands). Analysis of Sr/Ca ratios in the seawater samples will be based on the existing ICP-AES method for aragonite analysis modified to consistently attain accuracy and precision of 0.1% or better in a complex seawater matrix. Other techniques, including ICP-MS or ion chromatography will be used to verify the accuracy of measured Sr/Ca ratios and to analyze complementary geochemical data. Seawater samples will be collected in the winter and summer from channel cuts, lagoon, patch reef, reef crest, fore reef, and open ocean sites in the Florida Keys. Continuous records will be collected with osmosampler pumps in these locations during the intervening periods. Concurrent measurements of temperature with thermistors, and subsequent Sr/Ca analysis of coral nubbins placed near the equipment will enable verification and quantification of the impact of both water chemistry and temperature on coral aragonite Sr/Ca ratios. This sampling scheme will allow assessment of the influences of salinity, upwelling, river and groundwater inputs, and variations in productivity. The impacts of different physiographic environments on coastal seawater Sr/Ca will be assessed by comparisons between similar data collected in the FL Keys and British Virgin Islands. Differential effect of various parameters on the entire dataset in space and time will be determined by a combination of time series and principal components analysis.","lavender"

Microbes are of particular interest because, unlike most animals and plants, they can survive very long periods of extreme conditions. Therefore, it is possible that some microbes in permafrost are not fossils but are still alive -- essentially, living fossils. This research addresses an unresolved question of whether microbes embedded in permafrost are extinct, representing ancient terrestrial surface or marine communities preserved through time, or actively living communities that have been evolving since being buried. To determine how long microbial communities can live in permafrost, this project will study permafrost collected from the oldest known sediments of the Northern Hemisphere, which occur in Siberia. These intriguing marine and lake sediments are five thousand to three million years old and are found in stratified cliffs. This project will help scientists understand how biological communities respond to large changes in the environment, and its results will be shared with university students and high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>This five year project will document evolution of taxonomic, genetic and functional biodiversity over time using state of the art ""omic"" approaches combined with single cell genomic, cultivation studies and physical-chemical characterization of permafrost sediments. One of the key challenges of this project will be the application of evolutionary models to the DNA sequence datasets to distinguish between permafrost strata containing fossil archive models versus contemporary community models. The data will elucidate evolutionary mechanisms that shape taxonomic, genetic and functional diversity, providing insight into genome evolution and microbial adaptation to low temperatures. Functional, population genetic and phylogenetic approaches will be integrated. The international nature of this project provides a platform to expand a network of collaborative permafrost research with open system data management and sharing. This project will train scientists at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels, and engage high school teachers through molecular biology workshops. Interaction with Russian collaborators and travel to the Siberian study sites will promote international cooperation and provide training to students in how to conduct research with colleagues from different cultures.","salmon"

This project will provide a continuation of USA support for a further five years, 2011-2016. A continuation of funding by the USA will help maintain core monitoring by the CPR routes in the western Atlantic from Iceland down to the eastern margin of the USA. There is a growing awareness that the quality of marine ecosystems is subject to a wide range of impacts from climate change, acidification, eutrophication, loss of biodiversity to over fishing. Long-term observations like the CPR survey are critical in evaluating and quantifying the scale and effects of such issues as well as providing a macroscale ""backbone"" to an ecosystem approach to environmental management. As a long-term program the main objective of the CPR survey is to maintain the spatial and temporal integrity of the survey and to continue to add further years to the time series. Other objectives include: facilitating innovative marine ecological research, data provision and model validation, contributing to international and integrated observing systems and to knowledge/policy transfer.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit: The project will help monitor and describe the long-term, pelagic variability and diversity in the NW Atlantic. The data collected during this program will help scientists to interpret marine biological changes and begin to distinguish between anthropogenic, climatically forced and natural plankton variability. More specifically scientific research will be directed along four science themes: (i) Macroecology and climate change impacts including ocean acidification; (ii) Biodiversity and changes to ecosystem functionality including monitoring invasive species; (iii) Sustainable use of marine bioresources; (iv) Environment, pollution and ecosystem health including monitoring microplastics. All these four themes are crucial to increasing our scientific understanding of our changing oceans and are highly relevant USA marine policy requirements. Throughout the duration of the project it is envisaged that the data collected will provide invaluable information in addressing these highly topical themes and understanding these impacts on the marine ecosystems of the NW Atlantic.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The broader impact of this proposed project will be wide and will not only contribute to addressing U.S marine issues but will also significantly contribute to international programs such as IGBP/SCOR international programs as well as the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). New technologies have allowed CPR samples to be analyzed using molecular techniques and collect additional oceanographic information. Products from the survey are also being used to construct and validate a new generation of ecosystem, fishery and climate models. Securing the long-term maintenance of the CPR sample archive as well as the new microbial and metazoan archive will maximize its use by the wider scientific community by making it available for molecular, biogeochemical and other studies.

The core of a knowledge base is its objects (""entities"", such as proteins, people, organizations and locations) and its connections between these objects (""relations"", such as one protein increasing production of another, or a person working for an organization). This project aims to greatly increase the accuracy with which entity-relations can be extracted from text, as well as increase the fidelity which many subtle distinctions among types of relations can be represented. The project's technical approach -- which we call ""universal schema"" -- is a markedly novel departure from traditional methods, based on representing all of the input relation expressions as positions in a common multi-dimensional space, with nearby relations having similar meanings. Broader impacts will include collaboration with industry on applications of economic importance, collaboration with academic non-computer-scientists on a multidisciplinary application, creating and publicly releasing new data sets for benchmark evaluation by ourselves and others (enabling scientific progress through improved performance comparisons), creating and publicly releasing an open-source implementation of our methods (enabling further scientific research, easy large-scale use, rapid commercialization and third-party enhancements). Education impacts include creating and teaching a new course on knowledge base construction for the sciences, organizing a research workshop on embeddings, extraction and knowledge representation, and training multiple undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/>Most previous research in relation extraction falls into one of two categories. In the first, one must define a pre-fixed schema of relation types (such as lives-in, employed-by and a handful of others), which limits expressivity and hides language ambiguities. Training machine learning models here either relies on labeled training data (which is scarce and expensive), or uses lightly-supervised self-training procedures (which are often brittle and wander farther from the truth with additional iterations). In the second category, one extracts into an ""open"" schema based on language strings themselves (lacking ability to generalize among them), or attempts to gain generalization with unsupervised clustering of these strings (suffering from clusters that fail to capture reliable synonyms, or even find the desired semantics at all). This project proposes research in relation extraction of ""universal schema"", where we learn a generalizing model of the union of all input schemas, including multiple available pre-structured KBs as well as all the observed natural language surface forms. The approach thus embraces the diversity and ambiguity of original language surface forms (not trying to force relations into pre-defined boxes), yet also successfully generalizes by learning non-symmetric implicature among explicit and implicit relations using new extensions to the probabilistic matrix factorization and vector embedding methods that were so successful in the NetFlix prize competition. Universal schema provide for a nearly limitless diversity of relation types (due to surface forms), and support convenient semi-supervised learning through integration with existing structured data (i.e., the relation types of existing databases). In preliminary experiments, the approach already surpassed by a wide margin the previous state-of-the-art relation extraction methods on a benchmark task. New proposed research includes new training processes, new representations that include multiple-senses for the same surface form as well as embeddings with variances, new methods of incorporating constraints, joint inference between entity- and relation-types, new models of non-binary and higher-order relations, and scalability through parallel distribution. The project web site (http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/projects/natural-language-relation-extraction-and-implicature-through-universal-schema-using-embeddings) will include information on the project and provide access to data sets, source code and documentation, teaching and workshop materials, and publications. In addition, datasets will be disseminated via UCI Machine Learning Repository (or other similar archive location for machine learning data) to facilitate sharing with other researchers and ensure long-term availability, and GitHub will be used to facilitate release, sharing, and archiving of code.","indigo"

Subduction produces most of Earth's deadliest earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, for example around the Pacific Ocean rim's ""Ring of Fire"". ExTerra (Exhumed Terranes) is a broad US geosciences consortium that investigates rocks exhumed from fossil subduction zones - rocks whose evolution uniquely illuminates processes otherwise obscured beneath the surface of active subduction zones. ExTerra will partner with our sister European organization ZIP (Zooming In between Plates) using novel field institutes to promote collaborative research among US and European researchers focused on subduction zone processes. The E-FIRE project develops a new paradigm for collaborative geological research that focuses on collaborative field work to collect materials held communally, augmented by broad interactions through workshops and student exchanges. Each researcher contributes a different analytical expertise to a combined effort aimed at transforming our understanding of active subduction zone processes. International partnership is critical because European researchers actively investigating the geology of each field area will provide foundational field knowledge of the region and actively participate in analysis and interpretation with US researchers. The project will integrate students and post-doctoral scholars (Early-Stage Researchers, ESRs) into a developing international network of scientists, help train ESRs in research and education, and provide a model for future geoscience collaborations across disciplines. E-FIRE will also create a uniquely valuable sample archive that will be made accessible to the greater research community along with the data generated by this project.<br/><br/>Technical abstract OIA1545903 ""PIRE: ExTerra Field Institute and Research Endeavor (E-FIRE)""<br/>The purpose of E-FIRE is to trace the cycle of rocks and fluids through the subduction process, as recorded in Earth's premier example of a fossil subduction zone - the Western Alps, Europe. The processes by which rocks, melts, and aqueous fluids exchange and interact among different physical components of the subduction system control all aspects of subduction. These processes occur deep within subduction zones, and a full understanding of these deep processes is a challenge both for investigations using remote geophysical methods and for scientists investigating active volcanoes above subduction zones. Investigations of exhumed rocks from within the subduction zone provide a unique, direct source of information regarding these processes. Specific research questions that we will explore include: 1) How do elements cycle among crust, mantle and Earth's surface? 2) What are the depths, temperatures, and timescales of rock transformation and fluid release within subduction zones? and 3) What is the mechanical behavior of materials within subduction zones? The proposed projects will adopt a variety of approaches to address these questions, including mineralogical and petrological analysis; textural characterization; geochemical analysis of major elements, trace-elements (e.g. HFSE, REE, etc.), stable isotopes (e.g. &#948;37Cl, &#948;13C), and radiogenic isotopes (U-Pb and Sm-Nd); and thermodynamic modeling. E-FIRE will implement a series of Field Institutes and Workshops aimed at developing an international, interdisciplinary network of scientists focused on subduction zone processes. These activities, along with student exchanges among participating institutions, will train early stage researchers (ESRs: students and post-doctoral scholars) in research, communication, and collaborative practice, ultimately developing a career-long collaborative network. Samples and data collected during E-FIRE will be archived and made available to the greater research community.","chartreuse"

Graham Coop, Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra, and Julin Maloof.<br/><br/>Domestication of wild plants has produced the diversity of crop plants available today. During crop breeding, ancestral wild genomes gradually changed as domestication specific traits were selected. The process is a type of genome adaptation similar to natural selection. This project investigates genome adaptation in two crop species, maize and tomato, by comparing gene regulatory changes between the crops and their wild relatives. Expression of genes will be compared and bioinformatics methods will be developed to assess and compare genome change. The information will uncover key regulatory networks that are at the foundation of breeding programs and in the long run could provide new tools for genome-assisted breeding strategies. Workshops at high schools, public presentations and research experiences for undergraduates will expose diverse audiences to basic knowledge about agriculture from a genomic perspective. <br/><br/>Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation has been a longstanding goal of researchers studying evolution through natural and domestication selection. Polygenic adaptation, which is thought to be particularly important for domestication, is difficult to detect with current population genetic methods. This research will develop methods to detect coordinated changes in gene expression systematically across regulatory networks due to polygenic adaptation. These methods will be applied to two systems: domestication in maize, using publicly available data, and environmental adaptation in wild tomatoes, using gene expression data that will be generated as part of the research.

Especially in highly lethal diseases, theory predicts a shift away from the outbreak phase to a post-outbreak stage where hosts and pathogens persist in a shared environment. Such transitions in disease states present a moving target that limits the development of successful intervention strategies. This research investigates the factors that drive evolutionary shifts in disease dynamics by focusing on one of the most devastating infectious diseases of vertebrates in recorded history, amphibian chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungal pathogen that can spread rapidly through amphibian populations and cause extremely high levels of mortality, suggesting that it is a strong agent of natural selection. This disease has caused - and continues to cause - dramatic losses of amphibian biodiversity around the world. The investigators are using an in-depth understanding of chytridiomycosis to develop science-based conservation strategies. The research is integrated with educational outreach, including public workshops and presentations centered on the annual International Save the Frogs Day. <br/><br/>This research capitalizes on a decade of research in Central America and on an unprecedented archive of disease data, pathogen isolates, and host samples. Pathogen isolates and host samples were collected and archived during the outbreak phase of the disease and similar data are being collected during the endemic phase, beginning eight to ten years later. The researchers are using experimental and molecular methods to investigate the hypotheses that (1) the level of pathogen virulence has shifted since the original outbreaks and (2) that hosts have evolved to be more tolerant of infection. To test these hypotheses, the investigators are testing the historic and contemporary samples to identify phenotypic and genetic differences linked to pathogen virulence host immune defenses. The results will provide insights for safeguarding amphibian biodiversity and for understanding the role of evolution in shaping post-epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases.","salmon"

It consists of two pieces: a deep, multi-band map covering 5000 square degrees, and a ""cosmic movie"" of a thirty square-degree region obtained by revisiting that area at least once every six nights. The wide-area survey will measure positions, shapes, fluxes, and approximate (photometric) redshifts for around 300 million galaxies, and the time-domain survey will discover and measure light curves for several thousand supernovae and other transients. Data collection began in August 2013 and is planned to run for five annual, six-month observing seasons. Wide community and public access to the DES data are a vital component of the DES Data Management system, and will make the survey valuable in the long run to groups far beyond those actually carrying out the survey. DES uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a new wide-field, facility instrument built by the DES collaboration and installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.<br/><br/>This award supports continued operation of the DES Data Management (DM) system at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) from January 2016 to August 2021, that is, through the end of DES survey science operations. A fully calibrated and completely re-reduced public dataset covering the entire survey will be issued around the end of FY 2020. DESDM processes raw images into science-ready data products. This involves: (1) nightly processing of DES images, (2) annual processing of all images at the end of each observing season and release of a database to the Collaboration; (3) improvements in reduction algorithms, in close concert with the science working groups; (4) production of calibrated, single-epoch images released via the Science Archive at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory; (5) production and dissemination of two major public releases of data products, one based on the first two DES observing seasons (DR1), and the second based on the full DES survey (DR2).<br/><br/>In addition to their use for the primary science goals, the public release of DES images and catalogs stimulates a wide variety of research by the astronomy community, as well as significant engagement in citizen science by the general public.

The geologic record of Earth's past offers a glimpse of what could be in store for the future. Research by Ivany and her team looks to Antarctica during a time of past global warmth to see how seasonality of temperature and rainfall in coastal settings are likely to change in the future. They will use the chemistry of fossils (a natural archive of these variables) to test a provocative hypothesis about near-monsoonal conditions in the high latitudes when the oceans are warm. If true, we can expect high-latitude shipping lanes to become more hazardous and fragile marine ecosystems adapted to constant cold temperatures to suffer. With growing information about how human activities are likely to affect the planet in the future, we will be able to make more informed decisions about policies today. This research involves an international team of scholars, including several women scientists, training of graduate students, and a public museum exhibit to educate children about how we study Earth's ancient climate and what we can learn from it.<br/><br/>Antarctica is key to an understanding how Earth?s climate system works under conditions of elevated CO2. The poles are the most sensitive regions on the planet to climate change, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and the degree to which high-latitude warming is amplified are important components for climate models to capture. Accurate proxy data with good age control are therefore critical for testing numerical models and establishing global patterns. The La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island is the only documented marine section from the globally warm Eocene Epoch exposed in outcrop on the continent; hence its climate record is integral to studies of warming. Early data suggest the potential for strongly seasonal precipitation and runoff in coastal settings. This collaboration among paleontologists, geochemists, and climate modelers will test this using seasonally resolved del-18O data from fossil shallow marine bivalves to track the evolution of seasonality through the section, in combination with independent proxies for the composition of summer precipitation (leaf wax del-D) and local seawater (clumped isotopes). The impact of the anticipated salinity stratification on regional climate will be evaluated in the context of numerical climate model simulations. In addition to providing greater clarity on high-latitude conditions during this time of high CO2, the combination of proxy and model results will provide insights about how Eocene warmth may have been maintained and how subsequent cooling came about. As well, a new approach to the analysis of shell carbonates for 87Sr/86Sr will allow refinements in age control so as to allow correlation of this important section with other regions to clarify global climate gradients. The project outlined here will develop new and detailed paleoclimate records from existing samples using well-tuned as well as newer proxies applied here in novel ways. Seasonal extremes are climate parameters generally inaccessible to most studies but critical to an understanding of climate change; these are possible to resolve in this well-preserved, accretionary-macrofossil-bearing section. This is an integrated study that links marine and terrestrial climate records for a key region of the planet across the most significant climate transition in the Cenozoic.","plum"

The isotopic composition of nitrate has been shown to contain information about the source of the nitrate (i.e. nitrogen oxides = NOx = NO+NO2) and the oxidation processes that convert NOx to nitrate in the atmosphere prior to deposition. A difficulty in interpreting records in the context of NOx sources is that nitrate can be post-depositionally processed in surface snow, such that the archived record does not reflect the composition of the atmosphere. This intellectual merit of this work specifically aims to investigate variability in the isotopic composition of nitrate in snow and ice from the WAIS in the context of accumulation rate, NOx source emissions, and atmospheric chemistry. These records will be interpreted in the context of our understanding of biospheric (biomass burning, microbial processes in soils), atmospheric (lightning, transport, chemistry), and climate (temperature, accumulation rate) changes over time. A graduate student will be supported as part of this project, and both graduate student and PI will be involved in communicating the utility and results of polar research to elementary school students in the Providence, RI area.

Robin Buell (Michigan State University) <br/><br/>Co-PIs: Yuehua Cui and David Douches (Michigan State University), Jiming Jiang (University of Wisconsin-Madison), and Richard Veilleux (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University)<br/><br/>Potato is the third most important food crop in the world following rice and wheat and is cultivated for its tuber, a below-ground storage organ. Potato is distinct from many other major crops in that it is asexually propagated, has four sets of chromosomes (tetraploid), and all cultivars are highly heterozygous. As a consequence, potato has a greater probability of retaining deleterious gene mutations than sexually propagated diploids such as rice, maize, and soybean. These three characteristics make genetic improvement of potato slow and unpredictable due to a lack of understanding of the interaction of genetic elements in a complex background. Furthermore, there is limited knowledge regarding the molecular nature of heterozygosity and allelic composition in the potato genome and how these correlate with phenotype. The objectives of this project are to understand the contribution of genes/alleles, transcripts, copy number variation and epigenomic features to a complex of phenotypic traits associated with fitness in potato. Data to be generated from this project will include characterization of the genome, transcriptome and epigenome from multiple potato populations with differential degrees of chromosome number and heterozygosity and statistical analyses to identify genes and alleles associated with a set of phenotypes associated with vigor. These data will also facilitate modeling genomic features into phenotype. <br/><br/>Many of the genetic and genomic questions associated with potato cannot be readily addressed by using diploid model plants. Project efforts to probe the genetic complexities of potato will serve as a model genomics system for other vegetatively propagated, highly heterozygous crops with similarly intractable breeding systems, including alfalfa, banana, cassava, grape, strawberry, sugarcane, sweet potato, yam and scores of minor horticultural crops, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic machinery underlying phenotypic diversity. Through outreach activities in this project, the public will gain knowledge of plant biology, specifically in the uses of potato and its unique biology, through a suite of activities with the Michigan State University Children's and Horticulture Garden involving all age groups. Through engagement of high school and under-represented groups, this project will provide opportunities for students to see science as a viable career opportunity and increase the representation of women in computer-related science/technology disciplines. The techniques and approaches used in this project will provide a rich training environment for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in relevant and emerging disciplines of bioinformatics, genomics, and epigenomics. The data to be generated in this project through publication and deposition in public databases will provide the first high-resolution map of genome variation and its association with gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and phenotypic traits in potato. Sequence data will be made public through the project website (to be accessible via http://buell-lab.plantbiology.msu.edu/), the SOL Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net/) and through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive and the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus for permanent archiving.

The Science Coordination Office (SCO) was established to represent the research community and facilitates the project by working with support organizations responsible for logistics, drilling, and core curation. During the last five years, 26 projects have been individually funded to work on this effort and 1,511 m of the total 3,470 m of ice at the site has been collected. This proposal seeks funding to continue the SCO and related field operations needed to complete the WAIS Divide ice core project. Tasks for the SCO during the second five years include planning and oversight of logistics, drilling, and core curation; coordinating research activities in the field; assisting in curation of the core in the field; allocating samples to individual projects; coordinating the sampling effort; collecting, archiving, and distributing data and other information about the project; hosting an annual science meeting; and facilitating collaborative efforts among the research groups. The intellectual merit of the WAIS Divide project is to better predict how human-caused increases in greenhouse gases will alter climate requires an improved understanding of how previous natural changes in greenhouse gases influenced climate in the past. Information on previous climate changes is used to validate the physics and results of climate models that are used to predict future climate. Antarctic ice cores are the only source of samples of the paleo-atmosphere that can be used to determine previous concentrations of carbon dioxide. Ice cores also contain records of other components of the climate system such as the paleo air and ocean temperature, atmospheric loading of aerosols, and indicators of atmospheric transport. The WAIS Divide ice core project has been designed to obtain the best possible record of greenhouse gases during the last glacial cycle (last ~100,000 years). The site was selected because it has the best balance of high annual snowfall (23 cm of ice equivalent/year), low dust Antarctic ice that does not compromise the carbon dioxide record, and favorable glaciology. The main science objectives of the project are to investigate climate forcing by greenhouse gases, initiation of climate changes, stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and cryobiology in the ice core. The project has numerous broader impacts. An established provider of educational material (Teachers? Domain) will develop and distribute web-based resources related to the project and climate change for use in K?12 classrooms. These resources will consist of video and interactive graphics that explain how and why ice cores are collected, and what they tell us about future climate change. Members of the national media will be included in the field team and the SCO will assist in presenting information to the general public. Video of the project will be collected and made available for general use. Finally, an opportunity will be created for cryosphere students and early career scientists to participate in field activities and core analysis. An ice core archive will be available for future projects and scientific discoveries from the project can be used by policy makers to make informed decisions.","plum"

Integrating stable biochar into carbon-constrained agricultural systems in developing countries may be able to address long term productivity constraints. Despite its significant potential, it is less known whether biochar inoculants can be developed that enhance crop growth by improving growth conditions for nitrogen fixing bacteria, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The objective of this project is to provide fundamental knowledge of how to best develop and use biochar inoculants within smallholder agriculture systems in Kenya. Resource opportunities are mapped for entire farms, and biochar cook stoves optimized to generate clean household energy as well as agronomically valuable and environmentally safe, stable biochar products. The ability of biochars to provide improved growth conditions for beneficial microorganisms is determined using incubations under a range of soil conditions where organisms are imaged using advanced microscopy. A mechanistic understanding of the way certain biochar traits improve inoculant behavior are obtained by relating microbial occurrence to physical and molecular properties of biochars. The investigation of microbe-biochar interactions are novel and are expected to provide fundamental knowledge at the frontier of soil health science. For the broader community, project outcomes will inform about biomass use and optimization in agricultural systems, cook stove optimization, and mechanisms of microbial inoculant processes, which will significantly strengthen our understanding of soil health management and improve small holder agricultural systems in developing countries.<br/><br/>This project will generate innovative ways to sustainably enhance soil resources in developing countries. It is the first of its kind to embrace a full life-cycle approach to solving carbon constraints in small-holder agriculture that can be locally implemented and managed. This project will build local capacity in teaching, learning and research both in Kenya and the US. Students at the undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate levels will be trained using a wide array of new molecular technologies and approaches to system science. This project will make use of our existing linkages to the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, and communicate results directly to national organizations in Africa involved in education, research and policy making. The project is making results available through a project website, a permanently archived database on Cornell University's D-space archive, and a CD-ROM which will include cook stove designs, biochar-inoculant production and application protocols. Information will also be disseminated through workshops on biochar-inoculant methods, publications, project briefs, and presentations.","teal"

The collection is threatened by the increasing failure rate of old jar lids, which will be addressed by replacing the lids with ones made of archival materials. The collection contains about 1.5 million specimens from 140 countries. Endangered and extinct species are represented in more than 1,000 samples containing more than 200,000 specimens. Much of the fluid-preserved collection is appropriate for DNA analysis, in addition to being suitable for dissections. Ensuring that this material is properly archived and that information about is available online supports research on molluscan biology and conservation throughout the world. The project will train four undergraduate students from Drexel University in molluscan systematics, taxonomy, and curatorial techniques. Each student will work full-time for six months as a curatorial assistant at ANSP, learning conservation and preservation techniques. Students will receive an introduction to molluscan diversity and learn about the value of systematic collections for research in evolutionary and conservation biology. The general public will be introduced to the project at the annual Members' Night at ANSP, which was attended by more than 1,000 people in 2014, and at the annual Philadelphia Shell Show, which attracts about 1,500 visitors.<br/><br/>The project will rehouse in archival materials 41,000 samples from ANSP and integrate about 9,500 samples received from other institutions. Many of the jar lids in the collection are made of bakelite or steel, materials now known not to be archival for fluid preservation. When lids fail, the specimens dry out, reducing their scientific value; all non-archival lids will be replaced with archival ones. Jars will be moved from standing directly on shelves into aluminum trays, so that fluid levels can be checked by scanning entire trays rather than picking up one jar at a time. Before the advent of DNA technology, it was assumed that samples sent on loan from the fluid-preserved collection would be destroyed when they were dissected, so ANSP asked for similar material in exchange. However, it was not usually recorded when a sample had been deaccessioned for destructive sampling. Also, in some cases, the presence of an alcohol lot in addition to a dry lot was not recorded in the catalogue. Each sample will therefore be verified against its database record, yielding a current inventory of the fluid-preserved collection. A module will be added to the database to record the condition of the sample at the time of rehousing and any action taken. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators. Data will be made available online through the ANSP website (http://clade.ansp.org/malacology/collections/) and other portals.","puce"

All Native American languages are endangered, and over 120 of these languages have gone silent, which means there are no remaining fluent first language speakers. Experts recognize around 7,000 languages worldwide, and they estimate at least half will fall silent by the end of this century. Human language is highly complex and scientists have thus far only scratched the surface in analyzing and understanding the scientific diversity represented in the grammars of the individual 7,000 languages. Because the number of languages far exceeds the number of trained language scientists, one challenge is to train more linguists. Another challenge is reversing language endangerment, thus staunching the loss of languages, cultures and knowledge. Opportunities within linguistics that use informal science learning in linguistics, such as short workshops, conferences, and other training, have proven effective in addressing both challenges. One such project, the Breath of Life archival model, has been successful in engaging Native American citizen scientists to work with archival language documentation in repositories in California, Oklahoma and Washington, D.C. This project will fund the 2017 National Breath of Life Archival Institute for Indigenous Languages (National BoL), the fourth of its kind since 2011. Broader impacts include the training of Native American citizen scientists to work on their own tribe's language and the training of linguistics graduate students, who serve as mentors and learn from their experiences how to produce documentation that is both better and more relevant and useful to community language efforts. The general public, other tribal members and interested scholars will also benefit from access to the newly digitized archival materials from the Smithsonian Institution's holdings created as part of this project. <br/><br/>Co-hosted by the Smithsonian's National Anthropological Archives and National Museum of the American Indian, and the Library of Congress, the National BoL will last two weeks and introduce linguistics and the language sciences. Participants are grouped by their heritage language, with each group assigned an academically trained linguist for one-on-one mentoring in the analysis of archival materials in that language. Ultimately, these efforts by citizen scientists will increase their linguistic understanding of their languages, to support reclamation and further investigation of the languages. The National BoL will train citizen scientists from some 15 language communities, bringing the cumulative number of languages investigated in these national workshops to over 70. By engaging community members in research, this workshop broadens the participation of Native Americans in the social sciences by investigating aspects of language that directly benefit community goals. Importantly, the 2017 National BoL will also use professional evaluators to quantitatively and qualitatively assess the extent to which training targeted at capacity building in archival research enables community members to address critical needs in sustaining languages and continue to contribute to the language sciences. Finally, the informal science learning environment provided by the National BoL has the potential to show how it facilitates novel discoveries in linguistics as researchers engage with archival language documentation, while also training new cohorts of academic and community linguists.","maroon"

In this pilot demonstration project, software engineers and geochronologists collaborate to build open-source cyberinfrastructure that standardizes and facilitates U-series data analysis, reporting, and archiving and analysis and re-processing of the vast amounts of legacy data. The project uses the NSF-funded EarthChem-Geochron data repository that archives results from many dating schemes, stimulating inter-domain sharing and discovery. This cyberinfrastructure supports teaching and training at all levels and provides non-experts access to new knowledge. <br/><br/>This collaborative effort applies modern software engineering practices to solving the cyberinfrastructure problems of the U-series geochronology community, making the calculation, archiving, access, and interpretation activities of U-series geochronology as rigorous, seamless, and simple as possible.

The primary focus is archiving NSF-OPP Antarctic Glaciology program Principal Investigator(PI) field, laboratory, and computer model data (""PI data sets"") generated by funded research. AGDC has benefited from its location at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, because of its ability to easily incorporate related, important NASA-sponsored compiled products and other data sets derived from other efforts at the Center. The Center offers access to an extensive expertise in data management and web distribution as well. The current PI data set archives are available by direct data download from an ftp site. Data discovery, browse and distribution for AGDC data sets are supported by a recently developed web tool that provides MapServer-based geospatial browse, ordering, and data delivery. This site, the Antarctic Cryosphere Access Portal (A-CAP), permits rapid scanning of available data for a region of interest, and the ability to overlay multiple data sets over various continent-wide maps, images, and geophysical products. The intellectual merit of the AGDC is that it directly supports Antarctic ice and climate research by facilitating data access and archiving older data, important for change detection and project planning. The site's archives have been a contributor to many published research papers. The broader impacts of the project are that it will be part of the ongoing discipline-wide trend to a more web-based approach to earth science research and data access in general, in collaboration with partner data centers AGIC (Antarctic Geospatial Information Center) and MDIC (Marine Data and Information Center). Furthermore, by making ""real data"" on the cryosphere accessible to the public, it fosters interest and understanding in the Polar Regions and the changes going on there.","plum"

The fundamental measurement is a time difference caused by bending and delay of GPS radio waves as they propagate through the Earth's charged atmosphere and then through the density gradients of the neutral atmosphere. The elegance and simplicity of the measurement is related to the GPS's purposefully chosen radio frequencies; as unaffected as possible by the intervening atmosphere as they reach the Earth's surface, making them all weather, unaffected by clouds, aerosols, etc. This renewal project builds and continues to improve on earlier work supported by NSF and its partner U.S. agencies, NOAA, Air Force, NASA and Navy, with costs shared equally by the United States and Taiwan, which operate the COSMIC satellites.<br/><br/>Since its launch in April 2006, COSMIC has provided high quality data for science and operational use. The UCAR COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) is currently producing between 1,000 and 1,500 Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) soundings per day. COSMIC data are now being assimilated in near real-time by most global numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers, including the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).<br/><br/>Since its launch, the COSMIC system has produced close to 3 million high quality neutral atmospheric and ionospheric GPS RO profiles and many other valuable data products. These high resolution globally distributed data sets are being used to advance Earth system science by approximately 1,700 registered users from 55 countries, representing major U.S. and international universities, leading operational weather centers, research laboratories, and several private companies. <br/><br/>The work being conducted includes: (i) operation and maintenance of the CDAAC for data processing, quality control, and dissemination; (ii) improvement of the quality and quantity of COSMIC data products by enhancing the GPS RO science payload firmware and CDAAC software processing algorithms; and, (iii) operation of the COSMIC Program Office to support the national and international science communities. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: This project has high intellectual merit in that it operates, maintains and improves the state-of-the-art COSMIC radio occultation processing system that provides global, continuous, and all-weather observations of the atmosphere and ionosphere for research and operations. The COSMIC system is providing a gold-standard RO data set. This project will lead to cutting edge advances in system operation, GPS signal tracking, data processing, and inversion techniques to maximize its research value for the atmospheric sciences. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The COSMIC data have significant impact on research and operations in the atmospheric sciences because of their quantity and quality, complete global and diurnal sampling, and their ability to penetrate deeply into the lower troposphere. The fact that the COSMIC data are of high precision and accuracy, high vertical resolution, and require no inter-satellite cross-calibration, makes them ideally suited for climate research and instrument validation. COSMIC also provides much-needed ionospheric observations for analysis and forecasting of space weather, and other ionospheric research. This project also has a significant education and outreach component. It will involve graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows in scientific collaborations, and will continue to organize science workshops and support education and training activities. The COSMIC data and the processing software will continue to be made freely available to the broad university and user community. Beyond COSMIC, these activities will also have positive impacts on planning and execution of future RO missions.","fuchsia"

Signal transduction pathways hold the key to understanding the early response of higher plants to abiotic stresses, such as drought, flooding, heat, cold, ozone, and salt. For crop plants, the ability to cope with such abiotic stresses can drastically affect productivity. Traditionally, signaling pathways have been difficult to synthesize and impossible to manipulate computationally. Current pathway tools and databases provide only limited support for manipulating pathways as networks. In particular, it is not possible for a biologist to take an existing signaling pathway and ask hypothetical questions that are answered computationally. The project includes the training of recognized authorities by Beacon staff on the system, thereby empowering plant biologists to curate and archive signaling pathways for abiotic stress responses in the Beacon database. Usability of the tool will be addressed via a continual feedback loop between users and developers. <br/><br/>The user interface is an editing environment that represents and manipulates a pathway in a standard graphical notation called SBGN Activity Flow language, built on the network visualization tool VANTED and SBGN-ED, an extension of VANTED. Research herein will extend SBGN-ED to create Beacon. The result will be a curation tool that will allow authorities to enter pathways in SBGN Activity Flow language, edit them, annotate them, and save them to an initial Beacon database. The database representation allows the biologist to impose a semantic, such as Boolean semantics, on a pathway. The Beacon simulation engine is then able to computationally implement those semantics and provide results that can be queried and visualized. The Beacon inference engine provides tools to allow biologist to develop testable hypotheses about pathway components. The Beacon system will interest undergraduate students in computational sciences as well as experimental biologists. Well-established outreach programs at Virginia Tech will be used to provide training and educational outreach activities. An experimental component will be implemented in the final years of the project, where Beacon-based predictions concerning phenotype will be tested in the laboratory. At https://bioinformatics.cs.vt.edu/beacon/, users will have access to project outcomes.","puce"

The Earth's magnetic field is generated by fluid motions in the metallic core, a process known as the geodynamo. The time of origin and intensity of the geodynamo during the first ~1 billion years of Earth history are essentially unknown. The geodynamo's early history has major implications for the thermal evolution of the planet, the physics of magnetic field generation, and the habitability of the early Earth. The only minerals of which we are aware that might record the field during this earliest epoch are zircon (ZrSiO4) crystals found in sedimentary rocks in Western Australia. Ranging up to 4.38 billion years in age, they are the oldest known terrestrial minerals. Here the investigating team has developed a project to measure the magnetization of these crystals, supported by the Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education (INSPIRE) program, that could finally determine the geodynamo's time of origin and earliest evolution. This project is an international collaboration between geophysicists, geochemists, geologists, and physicists from seven institutions and includes leaders in ultrahigh sensitivity magnetometry, quantum science, radiometric dating, field geology, mineralogy, and stable isotope geochemistry. It supports the development of next-generation magnetometry techniques for the analysis of extremely weakly magnetic materials and geochemical techniques for determining the alteration histories of samples from the early Earth. It also funds the training of graduate students at three universities, who will participate in the international field work to collect samples, as well as in the interdisciplinary science.<br/><br/>The central challenge of this project is to determine the time of origin of the zircons' magnetization. Prior paleomagnetic, geochemical and mineralogical analyses have shown that the host rocks and many zircons have been pervasively remagnetized well after they formed. This team proposes to determine the thermal and alteration histories and study the remanent magnetization of numerous zircons older than 4 billion years from Western Australia. To achieve this, they will characterize the geology and stratigraphy of the zircon host rocks and determine zircon ages using U-Pb geochronometry. They will analyze the extremely weak magnetizations of the zircons using two new ultrahigh-sensitivity magnetometry techniques: superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy (SM) and quantum diamond magnetometry (QDM)]. Finally, a variety of microanalytical techniques will be employed to establish which grains have primary ferromagnetic inclusions. So that others can independently test these results, the team will create an open archive of their key measurements and samples accessible by other researchers and make time available on their magnetometers to qualified researchers.","hot_pink"

The research it enables is significant because it permits scientists to reconstruct multiple aspects of past environments and environmental change over time. Many species of trees add a visibly distinct ring of wood each year. The width of the annual ring may vary substantially from year to year, and these patterns of variation may be sufficiently distinctive to allow wood from a given site to be dated by comparison to a master chronology for the region. Dendrochronology was first developed at the University of Arizona in the 1930's. Once dated, the rings may be used to reconstruct variation in the factors controlling ring width. These include annual rainfall, annual temperature (at high altitude), the frequency of forest fires, and in which region the tree grew. A relatively new science is dendrochemistry - the study of variation in chemical composition from ring to ring within a tree. This award will allow researchers at the University of Arizona to undertake novel dendrochemical research on the enormous archive of cores from modern and ancient wood in the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree Ring Research (LTRR). The instrument will also be a valuable tool for LTRR'S outreach work with visiting high school science classes.<br/><br/>The instrument will be installed in LTRR. A priority will be the search for evidence in dated tree rings of former volcanic eruptions and major forest fires, both of which result in spikes of certain chemical elements that are then taken up by growing trees. Since volcanic eruptions often spread ash (microtephra) over a very large area, they offer a potentially valuable means of correlating archaeological and paleoenvironmental sequences across a large region. Dendrochemical analysis by micro-XRF potentially offers a quick and efficient means of detecting and dating these past eruptions. An estimated 30-40,000 wood samples in LTRR cannot currently be assigned a cutting date because the outer ring is indistinct. Pilot research has however shown distinctive chemical changes at the heartwood/sapwood junction in several species, and also in the penultimate ring. Micro-XRF will be used to scan currently undated cores to look for these signals, from which cutting dates can be derived. This research can potentially make available many more dated samples for archaeological and paleoenvironmental interpretation.","maroon"

Research on the use by companies of aspirational peers has focused on the prevalence and average overall level of bias, and has attempted to explain bias in terms of organizational and CEO characteristics rather than in terms of the networked environment. However, public corporations are tied to one another in networks along various dimensions, including similarity in industry and size, board interlocks, the sharing of compensation consultants, and the network of asserted compensation peers used by companies in the setting of executive compensation. The proposed research tests the theory that pressures for legitimacy and rationalizations of practices of contested legitimacy occur through mechanisms of local comparison, which involve both information transfer and the mimicry and co-evolution of controversial practices. Using stochastic actor oriented network analytic methods, the proposed research will estimate the effects of social influence and social comparison on the evolution of compensation networks in the post-2006 period, when the network is newly visible both to researchers and to the corporations themselves as a consequence of the new SEC rules. These questions are addressed through the analysis of a unique database that contains information on compensation peers for the universe of companies that have reported this information since the new regulations came into effect.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this project is the new understanding it promises about the dynamics of compensation peer networks of publicly traded corporations and the illumination these dynamics offer on the diffusion and modification of controversial organizational practices. A longstanding literature on the diffusion of innovations and organizational practices treated the practices in question as relatively fixed and studied the rate and extent of diffusion through the population. More recently, scholars have focused on the fact that many organizational practices are controversial, and as a consequence they advance, evolve, and retreat in response to environmental pressure and the conflicting interests of organizational actors and stakeholders. This recent literature emphasizes characteristics of organizations (e.g., the ""fit"" of the practice with the organization and organizational actors along various dimensions) that potentially explain the adoption, adaptation, or relinquishment of controversial practices. In contrast, the impact of organizational networks on the spread and evolution of controversial practices is relatively unexplored. The proposed research contributes to the filling of this gap. In the process it may provide an explanation for how the overall upward compensation bias in executive compensation peer groups is maintained and whether it is likely to persist into the future.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The broader impacts of the proposed research include the training of undergraduate and graduate students and the potential value of the proposed research for public policy. The project will also allow the continued collection of longitudinal data on compensation peers on a scale that does not elsewhere exist. After the project is concluded, these data will be made available for other researchers and also accessible for a non-technical audience. Using Javascript and HTML5 the query results can be visualized as a network, and network descriptives will be presented in a table. Publishing the data through such an infrastructure allows the data to be used for education purposes, and it allows non-technical audiences to explore this rich data source. The algorithm used to identify and extract peers from corporate annual reports in the electronic archive of the SEC can easily be generalized to extract systematic and previously unavailable data items in a wide variety of contexts. Instructions will be provided to allow researchers to use the algorithm for such purposes.","crimson"

Furthermore, advances in the distribution of real-time data are leading many new transient phenomena in space-time to be observed. Presently however, realtime decision-making is infeasible in many cases that require streaming scientific data to be coupled with complex models. While EarthCube will provide an unprecedented framework for disseminating data sources, the use of real-time data raises an additional set of complex challenges that must be considered. This project is a pilot to demonstrate the importance of coodinating the geosciences around their real-time data gathering and use. The work will demonstrate a Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences (CHORDS)<br/><br/>The vision behind CHORDS is to provide a real-time data management infrastructure that will: a)Provide a system to archive, navigate and distribute real-time data streams via the Internet; b)Be easily deployed and configured; c)Run on cloud infrastructure; d)Use transactions built on RESTful protocols (i.e. via URLs); e)Employ data and metadata formats that adhere to standards, which simplify the user experience; f)Be free and open source.Science derived from observing platform data is the result of years of planning before a deployment, for example, and millions of dollars are spent on the deployment itself in hopes of obtaining the desired dataset. Many geo-scientific experiments are often resource constrained. In such cases it is vital to guarantee the optimal allocation of resources to ensure that important events do not go unobserved. In geo-scientific domains it is not uncommon to analyze data after a field campaigns, only to detect sensor faults, calibration offsets or anomalous behaviors when it is already too late. Real-time data will enable the optimal allocation of constrained experimental resources by automating the detection of faults and anomalies. CHORDS will provide a framework to enable adaptive sampling, discovery and fusion of various real-time geoscientific data sources, thus facilitating a new means by which geoscience experiments are carried out. The use cases will illustrate this by showing traditional experiments would have missed events of interest due to lack of access to real-time data. Focus on the initial work of defining requirements, design and specifications. Begin to ingest a small subset of geosciences data streams into a prototype CHORDS structure built in the cloud. Participate in activities that strengthen the integration of real-time data being ingested via CHORDS into other EarthCube Building Block systems that are under development. They will focus on some initial test cases, in hydrology sensor data, radar data streams, the NCAR Lower Atmosphere Observing Facilities, and outreach to earth and oceans communities.","royal_blue"

Existing 6-meter to 10-meter ground-based telescopes all have relatively small fields of view and are operated in the traditional mode where a given project is pursued for a few nights at a time, after which different astronomers pursue data addressing a different scientific goal, possibly with a different instrument. Although this approach can make great advances, there are some crucial scientific problems that need to be tackled more like a physics experiment, whereby a dedicated instrument is used for a finite period of time to address well-defined objectives. This is the LSST: a large survey telescope using a wide field camera to image the accessible sky repeatedly to very faint limits over a ten-year period. The LSST data products will change every field of astronomical study, from the inner Solar System to the large scale structure of the Universe.<br/><br/>LSST will map the inner and outer Solar System, study stellar populations in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, reveal the structure of the Milky Way disk and halo and other local objects, find transient and variable objects at both low and high redshift, and survey the properties of normal and active galaxies at low and high redshift. Turning to far-field cosmological topics, LSST will explore the properties of supernovae to redshifts around one, uncover strong and weak lensing, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and baryon oscillations, and show how these different probes may be combined to constrain cosmological models and the physics of dark energy.<br/><br/>LSST will be built on the El Peï¿½ï¿½n peak on Cerro Pachï¿½n in northern Chile. LSST will have an effective aperture of 6.7 meters and an imaging camera with field of view 9.6 square degrees, and will be devoted to a ten-year imaging survey over 20,000 square degrees south of +15 deg. Each pointing will be imaged 2000 times with fifteen second exposures in six broad bands at wavelengths from 0.35 to 1.1 microns, to a total point-source depth of r~27.5 magnitudes. LSST's three large mirrors are actively controlled to minimize distortion, and the telescope structure is especially compact and stiff to reduce image motion and to enable rapid travel across the sky, maximizing the observing duty cycle. The project is an interagency public-private partnership, with the Department of Energy accepting responsibility for the world-leading camera, while NSF as overall lead agency will support the site facility, the telescope, and the extensive and sophisticated data management. Private donations have supported initial construction work that significantly reduces project risk, including the innovative primary-tertiary mirror, early site work, and development of sensors for the camera. LSST will produce on average 15 terabytes of raw data per night and an uncompressed data set for the full ten-year survey of some 200 petabytes. Dedicated facilities will process the image data in near real time.<br/><br/>The image archive and resulting catalogs will be widely and freely available. A sophisticated data management system will enable work ranging from simple queries from individual users to computationally intensive scientific investigations that could use the entire data set. The LSST Project is at the forefront of the information technology revolution and includes investments in technology, cyber-infrastructure, education, and outreach. With one of the largest scientific databases in existence, the LSST project presents challenging opportunities for research into database architecture and data mining. Education and public outreach programs are fully integrated with the research program and include engaging experiences for non-specialists, partnerships with museums, schools, and industry, and opportunities to challenge and encourage tomorrow's innovators.","lime"

The NSF-funded Cyberinfrastructure Engineer (CIE) collaborates closely with researchers to understand their needs and guide their use of cyberinfrastructure to ensure optimal benefit, and also works with university network engineers to make architectural, design, and configuration changes to the cyberinfrastructure to better serve the research community and ensure they are able to fully leverage local, regional, and national cyberinfrastructure. The CIE is part of an emerging program that embeds staff from the university's Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure (RCCI) unit within key research groups to provide a liaison between these groups and to provide collaborative technical support for their needs in cyberinfrastructure, including high performance computing, data-intensive computing, private cloud, peta-scale storage, and end-to-end network performance. The CIE engages not only with CWRU research groups, but also with their collaborators at other institutions to ensure the optimal use of cyberinfrastructure resources at all institutions and along the network paths that link them. Such activity is a critically important success factor as researchers tackle increasingly large problems and collaborate in geographically distributed research teams, and as they work to converge data-intensive and numerically intensive computing within the National Strategic Computing Initiative. Finally, the CIE participates in formal classroom presentations to students who rely on campus cyberinfrastructure in their research and learning experience in STEM education.<br/><br/>At CWRU, the CIE has primary responsibility for the university Science DMZ , perfSONAR, and data transfer node services. As the Science DMZ is tightly integrated with the university's high performance computing, data-intensive computing, private cloud, peta-scale online research storage, and near-line research data archive services, the CIE's responsibility extends into all areas of campus cyberinfrastructure and requires close coordination and collaboration with staff having primary responsibility in those areas. To ensure optimal end-to-end network performance, the CIE routinely works in collaboration with peers at other universities, government institutions, and regional and national networking organizations including Internet2, the Ohio Academic and Research Network, Ohio Supercomputing Center, NIH facilities such as NCBI, DoE facilities such as ORNL, and the NSF-funded national supercomputer centers. The CIE is involved in the university's efforts in IPv6, identity and access management, SDN, and OpenFlow, and works closely with information security and the network security groups.","mauve"

The appearance of herring in the spring signals the start of the seasonal round after a long winter. Herring is a key dietary resource during this time, but to some, herring is an economic mainstay throughout the year. Alaska Natives, as well as a range of North Pacific species, depend on abundant and geographically widespread populations of herring. In 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil spill devastated Prince William Sound herring populations in the northern Gulf of Alaska (Thorne and Thomas2008). The southern Gulf of Alaska has been impacted by commercial fishing, habitat degradation, and environmental changes over the past century. Bering Sea communities also depend on herring; in the words of Nelson Islander Louise Kanrilak, ?herring are very important to us. When we are out of herring, we are out of food? (Barker 1993:73). The scientific debate over the status of herring has been complicated by the lucrative commercial sac roe fishery that supplies herring eggs for Asian markets. Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers have witnessed the decline of herring (Thornton et al. 2010a) and many argue that herring are being managed in a depleted state. Alaska Native subsistence fishers and egg-collectors are sounding the alarm, while biologists debate whether herring populations are ?endangered,? ?threatened? or ?struggling? (Carls et al. 2009). Herring have already abandoned some spawning locations (ADFG 2011), and several First Nations in British Columbia have been forced to stop harvesting herring and spawn altogether (Speller et al. 2010).<br/><br/>This project aims to demonstrate how zooarchaeological and paleo-genetic research can be used to understand the dynamics of ancient fishing and fisheries and produce new knowledge that can advance resource conservation today. It will support the development and refinement of new methods of recovering and studying ancient DNA, and will greatly expand knowledge of the long-term history of Alaska Native use of herring. By encompassing the entire range of Pacific herring across Alaska, it will complement current efforts in British Columbia and integrate the knowledge of social scientists, biologists, and Local and Traditional Knowledge bearers. The health of herring is essential to the entire North Pacific marine ecosystem. Archaeological assemblages from across coastal Alaska constitute an unmatched archive of environmental data. This project aims to develop a more complete understanding of the ancient Alaska Native use of herring to better assess the historical abundance, biogeography, and genetic diversity of herring in the past. This effort aims to improve herring fisheries management to benefit a wide range of stakeholders in the Arctic, subarctic, and beyond. The project will gather samples of herring bones from archaeological sites across coastal Alaska for ancient DNA analysis. Preliminary work has shown that ancient mitochondrial DNA can be extracted from herring bones and is well-preserved. Yang and colleagues are working to extract nuclear DNA, which will facilitate comparisons to genetic results emerging from the study of the DNA of extant herring. In this project, ancient DNA from 150 herring bone samples will be studied to establish phylogenetic and geographic relationships. The age of many of these samples is established, but radiocarbon dates will be obtained for those samples lacking dates.<br/><br/>Understanding the temporal context will allow the researchers to identify changes over time. Collaborations between archaeologists, Native communities, biologists, and managers working in BritishColumbia and Washington State will permit region-wide understanding of the ancient use of herring across the North Pacific. The results of the genetic study will be disseminated to six communities in coastal Alaska through a traveling workshop which will leave behind resource materials that can be exhibited and will stimulate further study and engagement in management.","plum"

Trajectories of natural environment change are commonly analyzed, but less studied is how environment change opens alternative social and economic paths, which paths are most desirable, and what actions are needed to sustain them. How do Arctic communities remain viable and what are the implications for human capital development? Is the Arctic mixed economy, consisting of wage and subsistence activities, sustainable or is the Arctic transitioning to a predominantly industrial, wage economy? This project will help communities, workers, and businesses address these issues through analysis of current and prospective patterns of human capital development and careers in the major Arctic industries. As part of the the International Polar Research research initiative, this project will develop ?linked,? tripartite case studies of industry, workers, and communities and use videography as both research tool and as a means for community members to document and analyze ongoing changes. <br/><br/>Central to the study are the following issues: How do communities sustain their coherence and even existence in the face of climate change, of industrial economic development, and of employment and education opportunities that appear to draw off their younger members? How do individual workers develop skills and careers in highly seasonal work and/or while maintaining subsistence activity and traditional community participation? How do businesses sustain and grow their activities, develop and fully utilize available human capital, and adapt to changing climate conditions and to economic growth opportunities? Case studies include: fish processing in St. Paul/Pribilof Islands and oil and gas field services in the North Slope Borough. The Tribal Government of St. Paul will partner in the Aleut/fish processing case study; in the North Slope Borough, Barrow Arctic Science Consortium will partner in the research and several oilfield service companies have agreed to participate.<br/><br/>The important social benefits will be insights into sustainability of careers, businesses, and communities in the face of climate, social, and economic change. It will provide multiple perspectives on the impact of climate change on human and economic activity. Partnering with Native communities is an integral part of the methodology to document and assess the role of workforce development in future directions of community development. Video will be used to document and archive contemporary conditions as part of the historical record as well as providing raw ?data? for each community and for future research. The video capability developed in the communities and the technical assistance and participatory research will support ongoing education within and between communities as well as outreach to schools and the public outside the Arctic.","plum"

Phylogenies-estimates of the genealogical relationships among species-provide an explicit historical perspective that critically informs research in a vast and growing number of scienti c disciplines. Increasingly, phylogenies are inferred in a Bayesian statistical framework, as it permits estimation under more complex and realistic statistical models from larger and increasingly complex datasets, and allows uncertainty in the resulting estimates to be clearly identified and accommodated. Implementation of BETAbase will substantially advance the field of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and, by extension, the myriad fields of biological sciences (including conservation, medicine, and agriculture) that rely on phylogenetic information. It will promote more rigorous and consistent evaluation of published phylogenetic studies thereby improving the quality of decisions based upon those studies. BETAbase will also provide unique training opportunities by developing a web-based educational environment where researchers can gain experience and develop the skills to identify and address problems encountered in the course of Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. <br/><br/>The output of Bayesian phylogenetic studies typically includes both log files with sampled trees and the other parameters of the phylogenetic model. The output accumulated over the last decade constitutes an untapped source of information with the potential to transform the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and associated areas of biological research. The BETAbase prototype attempts to harness this potential to: (1) promote more rigorous evaluation of empirical phylogenetic studies; (2) focus theoretical e fforts on areas where existing phylogenetic methods are de ficient; and (3) implement software tools that enable solicitation of empirically based informative priors that appropriately reflect our accumulated knowledge regarding model parameters, providing an alternative to the vague `uninformative' priors that are currently used as the default settings in existing Bayesian phylogenetic inference software. The project will involve the participation and training of two postdoctoral scholars as well as graduate and undergraduate students. Finally, BETAbase will safeguard the substantial computational investment that the systematic community has made toward understanding the Tree of Life. The prototype BETAbase archive and associated tools will be distributed and discussed at http://beta-base.org.","puce"

Tropical Pacific climate variability is dominated by ocean/atmosphere coupled dynamics associated with the El Niï¿½o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The traditional expression of ENSO is characterized by a pronounced eastern Pacific warming, a weakening of the trade winds, and positive (negative) Sea Level Pressure anomalies over the western (eastern) tropical Pacific. These changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation modify the large-scale Hadley Cell and extratropical atmospheric circulation patterns via atmospheric<br/>teleconnections. Specifically, it has been shown that ENSO extremes excite variability in the Aleutian Low through a well-known ""atmospheric bridge"". The ENSO-derived variability of the Aleutian Low is integrated and low-passed by the ocean to yield the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) pattern in the North Pacific. The recent discovery of a new dynamical link between a special type of ENSO (with a pronounced warming in the central Pacific) and the North Pacific Gyre provides the basis for a potential positive feedback between tropics and extra-tropics. This project will use an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach to diagnose the mechanisms controlling decadal-scale variations in the subsurface Pacific Ocean and their role in tropical Pacific decadal variability. An ensemble of six long-term Pacific eddy-resolving ocean model hindcasts for the period 1950-2012 will be generated to address two goals: The first goal is to characterize and diagnose the decadal variability of the subsurface mean and eddy circulations of the Pacific Ocean. The second goal is to understand the role of the subsurface dynamics that generate decadal modulations of the tropical thermocline. This will be accomplished using a linear inverse modeling framework based on observations, reanalysis products, and the model ensemble simulations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Until recently, the decadal variability of the North Pacific was understood in the context of the canonical eastern Pacific El Niï¿½o (EP-ENSO) and its decadal expression -- the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider (in their previous grant) expanded this view by recognizing a new decadal pattern of variability termed the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). By diagnosing the large-scale dynamics of the NPGO it was found that similar to the PDO the decadal variance of the NPGO originates from the tropics and is forced by a different flavor of central Pacific El Niï¿½o (CP-ENSO). This suggests that the tropical Pacific acts as a primary driver of Pacific-wide surface decadal variability. However, the dynamics controlling this source of decadal variance remain largely unknown. While many studies have explored subsurface pathways to tropical decadal variability with coarse resolution models and observations, the role of eddy-resolved dynamics has not been systematically explored. Yet in the subsurface where direct atmospheric forcing is weak, stochastic forcing by eddy-scale processes can generate and/or transport large-amplitude decadal anomalies in water mass properties. This study will take a fresh look at the mechanisms energizing the Pacific decadal variance in an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach that allows to resolve and isolate deterministic and intrinsic dynamics of ocean variability. This approach has never been used to study ocean decadal dynamics even though there is growing scientific evidence that eddy-scale processes exert an important control on ocean climate. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Improving our understanding of subsurface climate variability of the Pacific Ocean carries important implications for decadal climate prediction, and for biogeochemical and marine ecosystem sciences. Decadal changes in subsurface transport and water mass properties (e.g. oxygen & nutrients) are linked to dramatic coastal hypoxia events along the US west coast. The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider have acted and will continue to act as interdisciplinary communicators to bridge the physical and biological oceanography communities by making the modeling data, analyses and the new understandings derived from this project available to marine ecosystem scientists through a local environmental program and several international working groups that the lead investigators co-chair. The eddy-resolving hindcasts will also be made available through the Georgia Tech Data server and will provide an unprecedented data archive for exploring eddy-scale dynamics in the Pacific and for conducting regional climate impacts studies with nested coastal ocean models. The project will also train a female graduate student.","lavender"

The project team will also establish a tiered system of support to ensure that grantees have the tools and confidence to produce high-quality content that will engage their audience. A key component of this effort will be a five-part course that presents the foundational skills for producing digital video content, accompanied by an interactive e-book that will help grantees organize their thoughts, articulate goals and objectives for their videos, and follow a production checklist of necessary components. The e-book will also include a series of templates (such as a goals-and-objectives worksheet) and outline and scripting formats. The project team will work with a subset of ATE grantees to test and refine the resources. The success of this cohort of participants in producing and disseminating content will be shared throughout the ATE community and with other groups of technician educators.","cyan"

FHSM serves as a major public fossil repository and educational institution. The paleontology collection represents over 100 years of fossil collecting and includes vertebrate and invertebrate holdings that are critical for understanding past life in the Great Plains. The specimens are used extensively in research and as the basis for educational programs and exhibits. Many specimens within the collection have been donated by local landowners and need to be fully curated and integrated into the collection. Additionally, the collection lacks a digital database and no specimen data are available online. This project will digitally preserve irreplaceable data and make specimen data (including images) available online for the first time. The digitization and sharing of these data will provide researchers, educators, students, and the general public with easy access to the collection, benefitting a broad audience. <br/><br/>Funding ensures that digital records of FHSM specimens are properly achieved and easily accessible for research and educational uses. Project goals include transcribing hand-written records, building a relational database with online platform, integrating data and metadata into existing research databases, curating backlogged specimens, 2D and 3D imaging of fossil specimens, and developing educational resources. All paleontology specimens and specimen data will be digitized and databased into CollectiveAccess data management system, which is being adopted to house collection data. The application of modern collection management standards will enable researchers and educators from around the world access to specimen data. The Sternberg Museum provides science education for a large, yet rural, region, making online access to material imperative to the educational mission of the Museum. This project will also employ multiple Fort Hays State University graduate and undergraduate students over a three-year period. These students will be trained in curatorial and research techniques using the specimens digitized during the course of this project. Overall, this project will greatly enhance the significance of the FHSM paleontology collection by improving organization, accessibility, and research and education potential.

Phytoplankton populations shift from nutrient replete conditions in the spring to nutrient poor conditions in other seasons. The San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT), located 17 km offshore between Los Angeles Harbor and Catalina Island, is a representative and accessible model coastal system with regular sampling and a substantial archive of relevant observations. The SPOT program has cataloged the dynamics, diversity, and productivity of microbial populations since 2000. With rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and resulting decreases in surface pH, it is critically important to understand the nutrient controls on primary production in coastal waters and the capacity of coastal ecosystems to sequester CO2. This project will examine rates of primary production, nitrogen uptake associated with primary production, and the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate (nitrification), at SPOT over two seasonal cycles. It will also contribute to the development of human resources in the marine sciences through the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Southern California and the University of Maryland. The researchers participate in education outreach activities (e.g. through the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence programs), and will incorporate findings from this study in those presentations.<br/><br/>This project will investigate primary production and nitrogen (N) dynamics at SPOT and specifically implement an analysis of new production. The new production conceptual model has been a powerful organizing principle in biological oceanography and provides a means to constrain the amount of primary production that may be exported or ""sequestered"" from the system. Despite qualifications to the definitions of new and regenerated forms of N as originally articulated, the concept has, for the most part, been narrowly applied, specifying nitrate as the primary form of new N, and ammonium as the predominant recycled form. Evidence continues to accumulate that these definitions may warrant expansion. N fixation can be at times a substantial source of new N; similarly, forms of dissolved organic N (e.g., urea) may contribute significantly to recycled production, but the specific organisms taking part in these transformations are still uncertain. Nitrification in the upper water column may also compromise the strict definitions of new and recycled N. Scientists can now probe more deeply into new and regenerated production, and directly identify major agents of these processes using new molecular techniques. This project will quantify new and regenerated production in a coastal ecosystem, illuminating the predominant compounds involved. Rates of primary production, nitrate, ammonium and urea assimilation, N2 fixation, and nitrification will be determined in the upper water column in concert with monthly SPOT cruises. In tandem, two stable isotope probing (SIP) approaches (conventional SIP for nitrate, ammonium and urea uptake coupled to high throughput sequencing and microarray based Chip-SIP for N2 fixation) will be used to directly identify the major agents involved in these processes, along with the uptake of 13C-urea into nitrifier biomass. The following two hypotheses will be tested:<br/>1. N2 fixation is a substantial source of new N in coastal waters of Southern California supporting export production. <br/>2. Forms of dissolved organic N, and specifically urea, can be substrates for nitrification and contribute substantially to regenerated production.","lavender"

SuperDARN is an international network of high frequency radars that measure the motion of ionized plasma in Earth's ionosphere. At high latitudes, the plasma motion is indicative of coupling processes between the solar wind, the magnetosphere, and the upper atmosphere. Operational tasks for the SuperDARN site at Kodiak include periodic maintenance visits to the site, software maintenance, development of control programs, updating the operating schedule, and monitoring the status of data transfers from the radar to the SuperDARN archive, maintenance of local computer systems to host the data, and support of users in the use and interpretation of the data. The research plan includes substorm studies, auroral electric fields, irregularity generation, neutral wind forcing by the ionospheric plasma, investigation of hemispheric conjugate phenomena, convection dynamics, and convection modeling. The study addresses some of the fundamental problems of space physics, and continued operation of the SuperDARN network advances understanding of the Earth's upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere, and the impact of solar disturbances on the Earth's plasma environment. Broader impacts include the maintenance of scientific infrastructure for the benefit of the scientific community. SuperDARN is widely used in the space physics and aeronomy community and each radar plays an essential role. Because it is an international network, SuperDARN fosters collaboration among member nations. There are currently at least ten nations that support SuperDARN work. It plays an important role in the space physics research programs in each of these nations. The cooperative scientific effort fostered under this program will also contribute to the education of the next generation of scientists.","fuchsia"

Observations of this region, known as the thermosphere, commonly show long periods (days to weeks) of relatively placid conditions, punctuated by large disturbances that can only be described as ""storms"". However, even quiet times exhibit a substantial and often seemingly random background of day-to-day variability. In the troposphere, large storms develop internally, without a requirement for sudden impulsive changes by externally imposed forcing or regional boundary conditions. While internal instability does also play a role in Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere (especially at low latitudes); much of the thermospheric weather is instead directly driven from outside by forcing from regions above and below. Upward propagating waves and tides make a ubiquitous contribution to the low-level day-to-day variability, whereas fluctuations in the solar radiation, solar wind, and Earth's magnetosphere dynamics drive a broad spectrum of thermospheric perturbations - and are entirely responsible for driving storms and other large events. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to understand the origins of day-to-day fluctuations in thermospheric weather, both large and small. Two state-of-the-art remote sensing instruments measuring thermospheric wind and temperature will be deployed in Antarctica, at latitudes that have been shown by previous studies to host the most extreme and complex thermospheric weather behavior. While previous work has measured thermospheric winds and temperatures across the globe for many years, there have never been instruments at these geomagnetic latitudes with anything even close to the proven sensitivity, resolution, and field of regard that are achieved by the proposed all-sky imaging design. Demonstrated performance of these new Fabry-Perot Spectrometers exceeds that of the previous generation of instruments at the Antarctic McMurdo and South Pole stations by more than two orders of magnitude, which will open revolutionary new insights in the fluid dynamics of Earth's polar-cap thermosphere. <br/><br/>This award will address a number of specific outstanding questions of aeronomical research: What is the main source of complex day-to-day variability that has been observed in the generally anti-sunward neutral flow across the polar cap? What are the mechanisms responsible for discrepancies between observed and modeled temperatures and tidal amplitudes within the polar cap? Do thermospheric gravity waves, propagating poleward from the auroral oval, deposit a significant flux of heat and/or momentum into the polar cap thermosphere? Are there any signatures of anthropogenic climate change and/or declining solar activity in the long-term record of thermospheric temperatures at South Pole?<br/><br/>Cutting-edge science, international partnership, and travel to Antarctica provide an ideal opportunity to achieve the project's education and outreach goals. Anticipated broader impacts from this project include training of a Ph.D. graduate student, furthering international scientific collaboration and cooperation in Antarctica, and providing real-time and archive data that will be of operational value to satellite operators, communicators, and navigators.","plum"

The warm water mass anomaly spread initially throughout the Gulf of Alaska region and later reached the North American coast, covering an area larger than the size of the continental United States. This prolonged multi-year ocean extreme caused dramatic changes in the marine ecosystems including bird and mammal die offs, and harmful algal blooms that contaminated shellfish across Washington, Oregon, and California. The atmospheric changes associated with this extreme event were also implicated in the 2014/2015 strong drought conditions over western North America. The research proposed here is to diagnose the mechanisms underlying the generation and persistence of ocean temperature extremes ('ocean heat waves') in the Northeast Pacific, and to investigate whether these events will become more intense under greenhouse forcing. This proejct will provide a broad range of interdisciplinary scientists with new understandings of the dynamics controlling the 2014/15 North Pacific warming, and of its possible links to climate change.

This mechanistic framework will not only allow us to interpret the dynamics of recent climate extremes in the Northeast Pacific, but will also provide a physical basis for understanding how such climate extremes will evolve under greenhouse forcing. This proposal aims at (1) diagnosing the basin- and regional-scale mechanisms underlying the generation and persistence of ocean temperature extremes in the Northeast Pacific, including the role of tropical/extratropical climate teleconnections and Pacific decadal variability, and (2) investigating whether there are physical links between these multi-year ocean extremes and greenhouse forcing. The primary tools for this investigation will be observational reanalysis datasets from operational meteorological centers like National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), sensitivity simulations with the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM), and the CESM Large Ensemble (LE) data. The CESM ensemble will allow us to clearly separate the internal vs. the anthropogenic-forced changes in North Pacific climate variance, and quantify its significance. Guided by our diagnostic understanding of North Pacific climate in the CESM-LE analyses, we will explore whether our findings are robust across a select set of climate models used for the fifth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), using both control and carbon-forced simulations available in the Climate Modeling Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) archive.","lavender"

In particular, the role of the tropics in climate shifts remains poorly understood. This grant will provide funding to the University of Minnesota at two campuses: Duluth and Twin Cities, in order to recover a drill core from Lake Chalco, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. These lake sediments have the potential to provide a half-million year record of North American climate. The core from Lake Chalco is directly relevant to one of the most densely populated urban centers on our planet, Mexico City, home to ~20 million people. The project includes plans to increase public scientific literacy and engagement, building on existing programs in Mexico (museums and mobile classrooms) and Minnesota (""Flyover Country"" mobile app), and to organize workshops for local K-12 teachers. A robust plan for evaluation of Broader Impacts is included. This project will contribute to the training of the next generation of geoscientists through the inclusion of students and postdoctoral researchers in the drilling project. This project will foster ties among scientific communities in the U.S., Europe and Mexico, both during drilling and continuing scientific investigations of the Chalco Basin. While the focus of this proposal is recovery of an environmental record, other groups have interest in utilizing the core or the boreholes for a range of studies including volcanic history and hazards, seismic monitoring and earthquake hazard modeling, as well as hydrological monitoring and teaching tools. No funding is provided for these related projects in the current grant.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This grant provides funding to recover a drill core from a >350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence contained in the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City in the Basin of Mexico. These sediments have the potential to provide a >500,000 year record of North American climate. This will be a unique climate archive that could develop into the ""type sequence"" for paleoclimate studies in North America. Chalco is well suited for reconstruction and investigatation of interannual through orbital-scale variations in the North American Monsoon (NAM) and hydrologic variations of the neotropics. Ongoing work indicates that the system records environmental responses to both Milankovitch- and millennial-scale climate forcing. In order to evaluate the relative role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating abrupt global climate changes, information regarding the geographical distribution, patterns and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics is still needed, particularly records to help define the nature of variability in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Precipitation over the Chalco Basin is determined by the position of the ITCZ and the strength of the NAM. Long-term (orbital) variations in the position of the ITCZ follow insolation. However, Holocene paleoclimatic records show an antiphase pattern in precipitation intensity between the tropical core of the NAM and its northern margins in response to ocean forcing (e.g. Atlantic Meridional Overturn, AMO, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). A record from the Chalco basin can be compared with existing long term records to the North and to the South to determine if this antiphase relationship to AMO and PDO forcing existed in earlier interglacials.","hot_pink"

It marks the end of the global warm conditions of the early Paleozoic that lasted ~150my and occurred under elevated pCO2 conditions. Considerable doubt has recently been raised with regard to the duration of the LOG, its potential driving mechanisms, and pre-glacial, long-term temperature variations. For instance approximately 15 Ma prior to LOG the North American continental plate was situated in tropical to subtropical latitudes, but sedimentological and paleontological evidence suggest a shift from deposition of warm water carbonates to deposition of cool water carbonates. It is not clear whether this sedimentological change reflects global cooling (indicating significant perturbation to the global climate system well before the Late Ordovician glaciation) or physical responses to tectonic activity with no requisite climatic implications. <br/>The projects will test competing hypotheses that try to explain this event through an extensive geochemical study. In particular, PIs will use the geochemical archive of conodont apatite (delta18O and epsilonNd) and carbonates (DELTA48, delta18O, and delta13C) to address questions about paleoceanographic conditions during the Early Late Ordovician. They expect that this research will lead 1) to clarification of potential causes for the paleontological/sedimentological changes during this interval, 2) to a better understanding of epicontinental sea circulation and an improved facies model for epicontinental low latitude carbonate platforms (for which no modern-day analogues exist), and 3) to better documentation of the temperature history of the Ordovician greenhouse interval.<br/>This research project will have active participation by undergraduate students, graduate students, and a secondary school science teacher. Therefore, the project will not only impact present university students and researchers, it will also impact future generations of students through enhancing an earth science secondary educations teacherï¿½ï¿½s knowledge base and science curriculum. Data will be contributed to publicly accessible databases making them available for further research and general education in the fields of paleoclimate and paleoceanography.","hot_pink"

IODP builds on a rich legacy of scientific ocean drilling pioneered by NSF in the 1960's with the Deep Sea Drilling Project, which provided a test of the plate tectonic hypothesis and a basic reconnaissance of deep sea sediments and crustal rocks. This was followed in 1985 by the Ocean Drilling Program, which focused on examination of Earth, ocean and climate processes. The current 26-member Integrated Ocean Drilling Program commenced in 2003 and has served as an expanded program of scientific ocean drilling based on ""Earth, Oceans and Life: Scientific Investigations of the Earth System Using Multiple Drilling Platforms and new Technologies; Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Initial Science Plan, 2003 - 2013"" (http://www.iodp.org/initial-science-plan). <br/><br/>Although the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program is terminating as planned in September, 2013, ocean drilling remains an essential capability in modern geoscience research and education and is used to examine processes ranging from changes in the Earth's climate to the rifting and drifting of continents. Drilling is the primary tool for sampling sediment and crustal rock from the 70 percent of the Earth?s surface covered by oceans, and is the only technique for sampling anything more than a few meters deeper than the ocean floor. Thus, the new IODP will commence October 1, 2013, utilizing the new science plan Illuminating Earth?s Past, Present, and Future (http://www.iodp.org/Science-Plan-for-2013-2023/) based on the planning efforts of over 600 international ocean and earth scientists. The plan identifies the following four themes for initial emphasis in the new IODP: <br/><br/>Climate and Ocean Change: Reading the Past, Informing the Future targets one of society?s most pressing questions?how will climate, the ocean, and ice sheets respond to ongoing increases in greenhouse gases? <br/><br/>Biosphere frontiers: Deep Life, Biodiversity, and Environmental Forcing of Ecosystems will focus on exploration of deep life within the subseafloor, where microbes isolated from the photosynthetic world live at the limits of habitability.<br/><br/>Earth Connections: Deep Processes and Their Impact on Earth?s Surface Environment will examine the links between surface, lithospheric, and deep Earth processes.<br/><br/>Earth in Motion: Processes and Hazards on Human Time Scales addresses dynamic processes that occur on human time scales, including those leading to and resulting from earthquakes, landslides, and tsunami.<br/><br/>The JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, and Mission-Specific Platform (MSP) drilling platforms will continue to be provided to IODP by NSF, Japan, and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling, respectively, to address these science themes. The new science plan draws upon lessons learned in the previous programs to build a much-simplified and streamlined multi-platform international program based on cooperation rather than integration. IODP planning for JOIDES Resolution operations will be conducted under a Facilities Board rather than an integrated Science Advisory Structure, and management and funding for JOIDES Resolution operations will occur independently of the other IODP drilling platforms. The Facilities Board (FB), already in place, is made up of scientists and governmental representatives of nations contributing to JOIDES Resolution operations, as well as representatives of the JOIDES Resolution science operator. The Facilities Board is advised by Proposal Evaluation, Site Characterization, and Environmental Protection and Safety Panels, and will be further served by a Site Survey Databank (SSDB). The FB and its advisory panels will be utilized for proposal review by other science operators in IODP. This new management structure has been developed and accepted by the International Working Group+, composed of governmental and science representatives from countries planning to participate in the new IODP. <br/><br/>The IODP Science Support Office, to be provided by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, will provide logistical support for the Facilities Governing Board and its advisory panels, manage and archive IODP Proposals and oversee their external review, and manage the SSDB. This Cooperative Agreement provides financial support for the IODP Science Support Office, and is intended to cover an initial five year, three month period beginning on July 1, 2013. A Program Review will be held prior to completion of the initial period and the results will guide a decision to re-compete or renew the Cooperative Agreement for a second five year period. The initial three months of award represents a start-up period designed to provide overlap with and ensure critical exchange of files and documents with IODP Management International, Inc. before NSF Contract OCE-0432224 for the IODP Central Management Office expires September 30, 2013.","lavender"

While scholars have demonstrated how these population movements can spread and exacerbate conflict, return-migration is assumed to be a purely logistical issue. Once the war is over, people will simply return home and pick up where they left off. Yet, conflict between returning and non-migrant populations is a nearly ubiquitous issue for post-conflict societies from South Sudan to Iraq and Rwanda. Why does return-migration -- usually a sign of increased peace and stability -- so often lead to conflict? To understand this puzzle, the author develops a two part theory: first that migration during and after civil war creates social divisions based on where individuals were during the war, e.g. those that stayed, those who left and returned, and those who left and remain abroad. Second, these divisions become more or less invidious depending on how ""returnees"" and ""stayees"" interact with post-conflict governing institutions, such as property and land rights, language laws, and citizenship regimes. <br/><br/>To test this theory, the project uses political ethnographic methods, including semi-structured interviews, documents and archive analysis, in the primary case of Burundi. The author then uses comparative case studies to demonstrate how the theory works across civil war contexts. International intervention for post-conflict statebuilding has become an increasingly high-profile issue on the international scene. However, a lack of understanding about the changing sources of violence after war, for instance as a result of migration, has hindered the development of effective policy solutions. By providing an explanation for how an often-ignored but ubiquitous consequence of civil war -- the return of displaced populations -- affects post-conflict communities, this project will generate a more holistic account of the dynamics of violence after civil war and help advance both the study and the practice of post-conflict peacebuilding.","crimson"

This would yield photometric studies of the Sun, which is a powerful tool for modeling and understanding solar variability. The current solar cycle 24 demonstrates that solar variability is still unpredictable, and therefore requires continued measurement. While absolute solar radiative flux is measured from space, solar images from ground-based telescopes are used to decipher information about the photospheric and chromospheric sources of variability. The SFO and California State University at Northridge (CSUN) are well suited to continue to carry out long term photometric observations, while keeping costs low and employing undergraduate and graduate students, as well interested faculty. The resulting data product will be a uniform photometric record of daily solar images in multiple wavelengths, eventually at least 50 years long, which will yield information needed to study active region contributions to solar irradiance across two or more Hale magnetic cycles. The models to be developed with the new CFDT3 data will be used to: (1) provide support for space-based irradiance monitors; (2) characterize past and future variations in the amount of solar power reaching Earth; and, (3) gain deeper understanding of the physical sources of the Sun?s irradiance changes. The SFO/CFDT photometry program records full-disk solar images at multiple wavelengths on all sunny days (about 65% of the year), and maintains an archive of metadata describing solar variability.<br/><br/>The broader impact of the SFO?s photometry program is four-fold: (1) maintain a fundamental scientific data set; (2) support space-based solar irradiance monitors; (3) generate secondary data of interest to the larger scientific community; and, (4) fulfill an educational mission. Using the new data from CFDT3, the project team will reconstruct changes in the Sun?s total and spectral radiative output. These reconstructions are a valuable tool for the solar irradiance research community: not only do they provide scientific information, but they also allow the identification of discontinuities in the space-based irradiance record that can help bridge gaps between spacecraft missions. The analyses of solar variability are applicable to the study of other Sun-like stars. A major impact is educating undergraduate and graduate students in observational solar physics. California State University at Northridge is designated as an Hispanic Serving Institution and Asian American Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institution. Its pool of students reflects the ethnic diversity of its geographic area. CFDT3 is a hands-on instrument that will entice and encourage students to explore and consider Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. Its accessibility allows for its integration into CSUN?s Physics and Astronomy curriculum at both graduate and undergraduate levels. Public outreach efforts through CSUN planetarium presentations expose the ethnically diverse population of the San Fernando Valley to the possibilities of scientific research.","fuchsia"

The San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT), located 17 km offshore between Los Angeles Harbor and Catalina Island, is a representative and accessible model coastal system with regular sampling and a substantial archive of relevant observations. The SPOT program has cataloged the dynamics, diversity, and productivity of microbial populations since 2000. With rising carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and resulting decreases in surface pH, it is critically important to understand the nutrient controls on primary production in coastal waters and the capacity of coastal ecosystems to sequester CO2. This project will examine rates of primary production, nitrogen uptake associated with primary production, and the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate (nitrification), at SPOT over two seasonal cycles. It will also contribute to the development of human resources in the marine sciences through the training of undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Southern California and the University of Maryland. The researchers participate in education outreach activities (e.g. through the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence programs), and will incorporate findings from this study in those presentations.<br/><br/>This project will investigate primary production and nitrogen (N) dynamics at SPOT and specifically implement an analysis of new production. The new production conceptual model has been a powerful organizing principle in biological oceanography and provides a means to constrain the amount of primary production that may be exported or ""sequestered"" from the system. Despite qualifications to the definitions of new and regenerated forms of N as originally articulated, the concept has, for the most part, been narrowly applied, specifying nitrate as the primary form of new N, and ammonium as the predominant recycled form. Evidence continues to accumulate that these definitions may warrant expansion. N fixation can be at times a substantial source of new N; similarly, forms of dissolved organic N (e.g., urea) may contribute significantly to recycled production, but the specific organisms taking part in these transformations are still uncertain. Nitrification in the upper water column may also compromise the strict definitions of new and recycled N. Scientists can now probe more deeply into new and regenerated production, and directly identify major agents of these processes using new molecular techniques. This project will quantify new and regenerated production in a coastal ecosystem, illuminating the predominant compounds involved. Rates of primary production, nitrate, ammonium and urea assimilation, N2 fixation, and nitrification will be determined in the upper water column in concert with monthly SPOT cruises. In tandem, two stable isotope probing (SIP) approaches (conventional SIP for nitrate, ammonium and urea uptake coupled to high throughput sequencing and microarray based Chip-SIP for N2 fixation) will be used to directly identify the major agents involved in these processes, along with the uptake of 13C-urea into nitrifier biomass. The following two hypotheses will be tested:<br/>1. N2 fixation is a substantial source of new N in coastal waters of Southern California supporting export production. <br/>2. Forms of dissolved organic N, and specifically urea, can be substrates for nitrification and contribute substantially to regenerated production.","lavender"

They model the chemistry of melting of the interiors of planets as a result of heat flow within the body. They calculate the flows of energy and mass from the interior to the surface. They model the interaction of fluids and rocks, which drives chemical weathering and the formation of ore deposits. They seek to understand the synthesis and stabilities of organic compounds and their economic and biological roles. They study the interactions of atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and land as a dynamically coupled evolving chemical system. To achieve this level of understanding of planetary evolution, Earth scientists use software tools that encode two fundamentally different types of models: (1) thermodynamic models of naturally occurring materials, and (2) models of transport that track physical flows of both fluids and solids. Much of the fundamental science of planetary evolution lies in understanding coupled thermodynamic and transport models. This grant funds development of a software infrastructure that supports this coupled modeling of the chemical evolution of planetary bodies. It is their aim to establish an essential and active community resource that will engage a large number of researchers, especially early career scientists, in the exercise of model building and customization. <br/><br/>This is a project to create ENKI, a collaborative model configuration and testing portal that will transform research and education in the fields of geochemistry, petrology and geophysics. ENKI will provide software tools in computational thermodynamics and fluid dynamics. It will support development and access to thermochemical models of Earth materials, and establish a standard infrastructure of web services and libraries that permit these models to be integrated into fluid dynamical transport codes. This infrastructure will allow scientific questions to be answered by quantitative simulations that are presently difficult to impossible because of the lack of interoperable software frameworks. ENKI, via the adoption of state-of-the-art model interfacing (OpenMI) and deployment environments (HubZero), will modernize how thermodynamic and fluid dynamic models are used by the Earth science community in five fundamental ways: (1) provenance tracking will enable automatic documentation of model development and execution workflows, (2) new tools will assist users in updating thermochemical models as new data become available, with the ability to merge these data and models into existing repositories and frameworks, (3) automated code generation will eliminate the need for users to manually code web services and library modules, (4) visualization tools and standard test suites will facilitate validation of model outcomes against observational data, (5) collaborative groups will be able to share and archive models and modeling workflows with associated provenance for publication. With these tools we seek to transform the large community of model users, who currently depend on a small group of dedicated and experienced researchers for model development and maintenance, into an empowered ensemble of model developers who take ownership of the process and bring their own expertise, intuition and perspective to shaping the software tools they use in daily research. ENKI development will be community driven. Participation of a dedicated and diverse group of early career professionals will guide us in user interface development - insuring portal capabilities are responsive to user needs, and in development of a rich set of documentation, tutorials and examples. All software associated with this project will be released as open source.","mauve"

Previous NSF-funded projects that involved studying engineers designing have primarily focused on studying students designing. There is a paucity of research on studying professional engineers designing. The science of engineering design requires empirical results not just from students but also from professionals. The empirical research method used to gain access to engineers design cognition is protocol analysis. This project uses a design-based ontological coding scheme to derive information from protocol studies of professional engineers designing. This coding scheme provides the foundation for describing the design cognition of designers and converts the qualitative data in a video of a designer into quantitative data from which statistical models of design behavior can be generated. These models characterize the design cognition of the designers. They are then used to compare the design cognition of professional engineers with that of students, whose design cognition was characterized in a previous NSF-funded study. Deliverable include an archive of protocol videos, a set of protocol transcripts, and a set of research methodologies as well as the statistical models.<br/><br/>If successful, this research will characterize the design behavior of professional engineers. This will then be compared with the behavior predicted by formal models of designing. The results of this research are intended to provide the basis for determining similarities and differences between the design behavior of professional engineers and undergraduate engineers. The results will be disseminated to allow for improvement in design education to bring students to closer to professional engineers during their undergraduate and graduate design education. The results are intended to lay the foundation for the generation of design support tools.","navy_blue"

A major limitation to these programs is an understanding of how the genetic information affects the characteristics of plants that improve the amount of edible portions. Moreover, the predictive understanding is even less if the plants are placed in new, stressful environments like low rainfall or high temperature. A likely avenue of inquiry to improve breeding is to better connect how information stored in genes becomes traits of plants that combine their biology, such as photosynthetic rate or the amount of resources allocated to an edible root, with the physical world, such as the amount of water available or an excessive heat wave. These connections are currently often made in a way that requires new data collection for every new crop plant or environment such as a new soil, new temperature range or even a new improved line that shows variation in the amount of resources the plant allocates to an edible root. This continuous need for new information ultimately slows down the breeding program and the ability of plant scientists to quickly respond to the needs of society. This project will test a new approach that uses large amounts of data to calculate the probability that a particular plant characteristic will be displayed by a given plant line under various environmental conditions. Specifically, the project will measure plant performance continuously by sending electrical pulses through plants, integrating the data generated with large data sets that show which genes are active as well as the level of biologically relevant molecules that contribute to major metabolic pathways within the plants at any given time. This new approach requires high performance computing to test many times how the probability of phenotypic improvement in the crop may occur. These high performance computing approaches will become a core part of a modern, competitive workforce. In this regard, the project will provide workshops for high school teachers in the use of high performance yet open source computing tools in their classrooms. In addition, the project will develop experimental and computational modules in biological and quantitative learning for students in grades 6-12 using the highly successful Wisconsin FastPlants system (http://www.fastplants.org/). <br/><br/>With increasing world populations, genetic advances to improve crop growth, yield and resistance to abiotic stress are a pressing need. Limiting the speed of crop improvement is a crucial knowledge gap regarding biophysical processes that modulate the relationship between the genome and phenome, hindering the ability to predict the phenotype of novel genotypes in novel environments. As a first step towards bridging this gap, a combination of high-throughput phenotyping and biophysical process modeling will incorporate allelic variation at key genes affecting plant carbon metabolism, hydraulics, and resource allocation, all of which are known to impact drought- and heat-stress resistance in plants. Variable selective pressures during crop diversification have caused extensive phenotypic variation among B. rapa crops, making it an excellent study system to both connect organ-level measures both down to the level of transcriptomic and metabolomic phenotypes and up to yield and to test predictive process models. Process models will be developed and refined using the mechanistic links that connect cell processes and ultimately whole plant physiology to regulatory intermediates such as metabolites and gene transcripts. If successful, the models developed will enable prediction of whole-plant stress-response phenotypes in heterogeneous genotypes and environments. The goals of the project are to: 1) deploy a novel high-throughput and real-time phenotyping method to measure diel physiological dynamics in eight B. rapa parental Nested Association Mapping (NAM) lines under drought- and heat-stress conditions; 2) predict yield in a Recombinant Inbred Line (RIL) population of B. rapa using a biophysical process model of carbon metabolism, hydraulics and resource allocation to test systems-level links between circadian, transcriptomic, metabolomic, and physiological QTL; and 3) test the predictive ability of the biophysical process model under heat- and drought-stress environments using the RIL population used in Aim 2.

The host institutions for the fellowship are Cornell University and Michigan State University, and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Edward Buckler and Dr. Michael Thomashow.<br/><br/>The fellowship will enable Christine Gault to gain experience in quantitative genetics and plant physiology. To broaden scientific participation in students of all ages, Christine will mentor undergraduate students in hypothesis-based research projects. She will also develop educational tools in the form of data nuggets, a standardized format that allows K-12 and undergraduate students to analyze real data in the classroom. <br/><br/>Maize (corn) is the most widely planted, economically important grain crop in the United States. Cold temperatures limit its growing season length because maize cannot survive prolonged freezing temperatures. A freezing-tolerant maize line would produce more grain due to an extended growing season while providing longer periods of soil cover to reduce water run-off and soil erosion. However, it is unknown which genes or genic regions could be introduced into maize to make it cold tolerant. The goal of this project is to identify such genes in a freeze-tolerant species that is closely related to maize.<br/><br/>The perennial grass genus Tripsacum is very closely related to maize, and some members can survive freezing stress. This research will identify genes that confer freezing tolerance in Tripsacum grasses. First, comparative genomic and transcriptomic analyses will reveal how cold-related gene families have changed since maize and Tripsacum diverged. Second, cold-induced gene expression and phytohormonal changes will be measured in freezing-tolerant and freezing-sensitive Tripsacum plants. Finally, a quantitative trait locus mapping approach will identify freezing tolerance genes in a diverse population. Understanding the genetic basis for freezing tolerance in Tripsacum will enable the development of freezing tolerant maize lines.

Genetic variants will be identified first using all-new imaging and computational tools being developed in the laboratory. By imaging and measuring plant responses to cold using computer-based methods, the project will access otherwise obscure information about how seeds take up water, germinate, emerge from the soil and grow under varying cold conditions. Molecular level differences will be identified using genomic methods that associate cold responses to genetic variants. Genetic hypotheses about these cold hardy candidates will then be tested in early-planted corn fields by comparing growth and yield in plants carrying different versions of the identified genetic elements. Undergraduate students from diverse institutions, including rural and urban locations, will be trained through direct participation at all levels of data generation and analysis. The critical role of students will result in a project with highly integrated research and education outcomes. For example, student-lead experiments will be conducted on educational corn field sites, further advancing student learning about scientific methods while at the same time providing critical research data. The project stands to make a positive impact on an important limitation to US agriculture by identifying the genetic basis of cold-resistance in corn and by training the next generation to apply the knowledge to real world situations.<br/><br/>The research plan integrates natural variation in diverse populations, advanced genomics techniques, and custom machine-vision methods to capture a systems-level understanding of the complex responses to cold stress. Populations will include recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines and doubled haploids, and includes parents of the Nested Association Mapping population and the Wisconsin Diversity Panel. Cold tolerant alleles in maize will be identified with genome wide association and QTL analyses, and hypotheses about the genetic architecture and inheritance patterns of cold response phenotypes will be rigorously tested. Aim 1 will refine machine vision methods for measuring germination phenotypes, while Aim 2 will focus on chilling stress during seedling growth. Aim 3 will determine transcriptome and chromatin responses associated with cold treatment to identify genes and targets of epigenetic regulation that affect tolerance. Aim 4 will determine the impacts of contrasting alleles for cold stress response on life cycle traits in field experiments to determine if early season cold tolerance translates to improved yield.

In addition, they do not fit into other well-defined small silencing RNA-producing categories such as small interfering RNAs (siRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Despite the importance of lncRNAs in development, epigenetic modification, and stress responses, there is still much to be learned about their structure, protein interactions, and functions, especially in model and crop plant species. This project will address this significant gap using a combination of genomic, evolutionary, and bioinformatics approaches. It is anticipated that the data, web-accessible genome analytical tools, and data management systems developed by the project will provide novel insights into plant gene expression regulation by lncRNAs, and provide important new findings and resources for studies focused on the improvement of numerous crop and genetic model plants. With regard to outreach and training, this project will provide interdisciplinary research training in RNA biology, computational science and evolutionary biology for students and postdoctoral associates. In addition, the project will develop an interdisciplinary course entitled ""Applied Concepts in RNA Biology"" that will leverage large-scale computing and datasets to understand various aspects of the role of RNA in biological systems. This project-based course will teach the fundamentals of RNA biology, next-generation sequencing techniques, distributed and high performance computing, data-intensive science, and collaborative research techniques that will be used in student-driven research projects. The course will be taught simultaneously at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Arizona, with two-way audio/video conferencing and lecture topics alternatively taught at each site.

The specific goals of the project are to define a subset of lncRNAs that are important for proper gene regulation in both normal development and stress response. Specifically, the project will focus on identifying and functionally characterizing those lncRNAs that are (1) nuclear, (2) highly structured, (3) stress responsive, (4) protein bound, and (5) evolutionary conserved in genetic models (Eutrema salsugineum and Arabidopsis thaliana) and in crop species (Camelina sativa, Brassica rapa, Zea mays, and Sorghum bicolor), focusing on their roles in stress adaptation.

The effects of hybridization, intense artificial selection, and introgression of disease-resistance loci on microbial endophyte communities will be measured using high-throughput amplicon sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and culture-based methods. Greenhouse re-inoculation experiments will then test whether breeding-induced microbiome alterations feed back to affect plant vigor and pathogen resistance. Data will be shared publicly at the NCBI Short Read Archive and repositories such as Dryad, and maize endophyte cultures will be shared on request.","teal"

The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Bradlee Nelms is ""Specification and Differentiation of Maize Archesporial Cells During Early Anther Development."" The host institution for the fellowship is Stanford University and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Virginia Walbot.<br/><br/>The fellowship activities are focused on understanding early anther development in maize. As a reproductive organ of a major crop plant, the maize anther plays a central role in many processes of agronomic importance. Defects in early anther development lead to male sterility, decreasing grain number and yield in many cereal crops. Furthermore, one of the earliest causes of yield loss in response to heat and drought is pollen inviability; thus, understanding anther development and male fertility will be important to insuring food security in the face of climate change. This project will increase knowledge of basic reproductive biology, information that can ultimately lead to breakthroughs in crop breeding and yield enhancement. The fellowship activities will also promote teaching and learning both within academia and in the general public. The fellow will lead an undergraduate-focused outreach project to design and market educational materials, helping to communicate the broad importance of the plant sciences to the community and stimulating collaboration between undergraduates from scientific fields and other disciplines. Further educational outreach will include mentoring undergraduate and high school students in laboratory research.<br/><br/>The overarching scientific goal of this research is to uncover early events in the development of archesporial (AR) cells--the first cell type within the anther committed to meiosis and pollen production. Major aims are to (1) identify cellular intermediates as AR cells differentiate into meiocytes and (2) investigate the role of TGA-type transcription factors in AR cell specification. These aims will be pursued using a combination of genomics, genetics, and biochemistry. Single-cell RNA sequencing will allow the identification of distinct AR cell populations, which will then be ordered into a developmental pathway by integrating transcriptome data with in situ localization of RNA transcripts. The subcellular localization, redox status, and DNA binding activity of several TGA transcription factors will be assessed in early stage anthers under various genetic and physiological perturbations, and downstream signaling pathways for the TGA factors will be evaluated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Together, the fellowship activities will generate substantial transcriptomic and ChIP-Seq data, clarify the differentiation program of AR cell development, and help to characterize the regulation and signaling of TGA family transcription factors during AR cell specification in a spatio-temporal context. Research results will be presented at national conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, and all sequence data will be submitted to public repositories such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).","teal"

The overarching goal of the project is to gain a deeper understanding into how cytokinin regulates these processes by using an integrative transcriptomic and genomic approach to build a dynamic model of the cytokinin response in rice. These new insights may provide new effective strategies to engineer this signaling pathway to modify various agronomical traits in rice needed to meet the future food supply and demand. The broader impacts of the project consist of training undergraduate and graduate students, assisting the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center with a series of workshops designed for UNC graduate students, and participating in the North Carolina DNA Day, which is an annual event where North Carolina researchers from various institutions advocate careers in science and biotechnology and give biology lessons to high schools throughout North Carolina. Training objectives include acquiring expertise with new transcriptomic and genomics methods, and bioinformatics tools.<br/><br/>This project seeks to: 1) kinetically characterize the transcriptional and open chromatin profiles using RNA-Seq and formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE-seq), respectively, in response to cytokinins in shoots and roots in rice; 2) integrate these datasets, build dynamic models for the cytokinin response, and identify cis-acting regulatory elements by utilizing a variety of bioinformatics tools; and 3) adapt assay for transposase accessible chromatin followed by sequencing (ATAC-seq) for use in rice and then use this method in conjunction with RNA-Seq to build dynamic tissue-specific cytokinin response models in the shoot and root meristems in rice. These models will be tested and validated in future studies by altering different modules and components to ascertain their specific function in the cytokinin signaling pathway and effects on agronomical traits in rice.

New research strategies should create novel crop traits that have not yet been achieved in order to substantially enhance yield potential under marginal environments. How can this enormous goal be attained? It is now fully appreciated that any further improvements in genetic potential for yield, stress tolerance and water and nutrient use efficiency will have to rely on the ability to create complex genomic configurations that lead to novel biochemical and physiological traits. This project represents the use of contemporary research tools to solve an old puzzle. It represents a closer look and more strategic examination of one of the most enigmatic and relatively unexploited concepts in plant genetics, the phenomenon of transgressive variation. Transgressive variation is observed when progeny derived from two divergent parents are superior (or inferior) to both parents. Using rice to test the concept, this project will determine which DNA segments or RNA molecules cause transgressive traits for salinity and low temperature stress tolerance.<br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that transgressive stress tolerance phenotypes in biparental cross combinations of rice are the consequences of ideal shuffling and complementation effects between two divergent parental genomes leading to genetic network rewiring. New paradigms built upon the power of regulon restructuring, regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and DNA methylation will be explored to understand the intricate mechanisms by which novel gene expression patterns mediate transgression from parental phenotypes. By integrated use of various next-generation DNA sequencing applications such as genome-Seq, mRNA-Seq, ncRNA-Seq, and bisulfite-Seq, this project will: 1) discover stress-regulated miRNAs/siRNAs that are transgressively expressed in intraspecific recombinants with novel salt tolerance phenotypes, and those that are transgressively expressed in interspecific recombinants with novel low temperature or other stress tolerance attributes; 2) establish meaningful correlations between mRNA and miRNA/siRNA transcriptome signatures among recombinants and their respective parents to evelop hypotheses on how global gene expression is altered in transgressive segregants; and 3) establish meaningful correlations between transcriptome signatures and genome methylation profiles between recombinants and their parents to develop hypotheses on how epigenomic changes alter gene regulation in transgressive segregants. The approach will address the possibilities that: a) stress tolerance phenotypic transgression is due to regulatory genes that acquired optimal function because of compatible regulatory clusters in their new genetic background, i.e., regulon restructuring; b) network reconfiguration in recombinants is due to coupling or uncoupling of trans-acting ncRNAs and their target regulatory genes or genomic loci from either parents; and c) genome shuffling alters the methylation profiles in recombinants leading to novel gene expression signatures. Outcomes will advance our understanding of the intricacies of genetic and epigenetic networks towards applications to stress tolerance breeding in rice and other major cereal crops. The genomics datasets to be generated will be made available to the broader scientific community through public data repositories including the Sequence Read Archive of NCBI and DDBJ. The rice genetic stocks to be characterized will be made available to other researchers through the USDA rice genetic stock maintenance and distribution center.","teal"

Dense planting increases the canopy cover and blocks sunlight from reaching the lower leaves, thus stimulating shade avoidance responses which limits crop yield. Information obtained from this research can contribute to genetic engineering of maize to improve yield under high planting densities.

The functions of the office include managing the curation and long-term storage of the SAFOD physical samples at the IODP Gulf Coast Repository (GCR) of Texas A&M University, cutting and distributing sub-samples awarded to scientists, maintaining a digital archive of sampling history and publications resulting from study of the physical samples, working to increase the diversity of researchers participating in sample characterizations, and fostering integration of SAFOD results with those of the broader scientific community studying earthquake mechanics. The management office works with three committees charged with reviewing policies and maintaining effective operations necessary to meet commitments to the Principal Investigator (PI) user community, specifically the SAFOD Advisory Committee (SAC), the SAFOD Core Sample Working Group (CoSWoG), and the SAFOD Sample Committee (SSC). The primary objectives of the management office are to preserve the SAFOD samples in cold storage lockers and to facilitate continuing use of the samples for independent PI-driven geoscience research. As part of the management office activities, a Web-based mapping and sample request tool, the Core Viewer, is maintained and updated annually for communicating sample request and sample award information to the scientific community. This is the primary tool for recording, reviewing, and executing sample distributions to scientists.<br/><br/>The San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) is one of the major research facilities of EarthScope and provides for the study and direct monitoring of the physical and chemical processes that control fault creep and earthquake rupture in an active plate-boundary fault zone. The most significant achievements of SAFOD to date are the successful scientific drilling across the San Andreas Fault at ~3 km depth, initiating an in situ geological and geophysical characterization of the fault zone, and the successful collection of valuable core and other physical samples from across the active components of the fault. The samples form the basis of ongoing laboratory investigations using a variety of technologies and approaches to address fundamental questions of earthquake mechanics. These studies are transforming our understanding of faulting processes and ultimately will advance modeling and monitoring of seismogenic faults, and earthquake hazard mitigation.<br/><br/>The physical sample collection of SAFOD is truly exceptional and of great scientific value. The collection is the direct result of over 15 years of careful planning and completion of a multi-phase, complex drilling project. The samples provide a window to the active processes operating in a major active plate-boundary fault at seismogenic depths. The data and interpretations that result from the scientific analysis of these unique samples establish an important baseline for comparison with other drilled fault zones and with geological observations of exhumed faults. Because of their unique characteristics, the SAFOD samples are in high demand by researchers worldwide; no other active seismogenic fault zone drilling program is set up to provide samples to a large number of researchers for continued scientific discovery. In addition to sample curation and distribution, the SAFOD sample facility provides valuable materials for education and outreach, and promotes the sharing of scientific data internationally. Efficient and thoughtful management of this resource is facilitiating scientific investigations.

While it still is feasible to create such data without breaching confidentiality, scholars are pursuing research programs that mandate inherently identifiable data, such as geospatial relations, exact genome data, networks of all sorts, and linked administrative records. These researchers acquire authorized restricted access to the confidential identifiable data and perform their analyses in secure environments. The researcher is allowed to publish results that have been filtered through a statistical disclosure limitation protocol. Scientific scrutiny is hampered because the researcher cannot effectively implement a data-management plan that permits sharing these restricted-access data with other scholars. The data-custody problem is impeding the ""acquire, archive, and curate"" model that dominated social science data preservation in the era of public-use micro-data. This project will bridge the transition to restricted-access data and offer the scholar, the scientific community, and the custodial agency a feasible path to long-term data preservation. The Comprehensive Census Bureau Metadata Repository (CCBMR) will be a Data Documentation Initiative-based curation system designed and implemented in a manner that permits synchronization between the public and confidential versions of the repository. The scholarly community will use the CCBMR as it would use a conventional metadata repository, deprived only of the values of certain confidential information, but not their metadata. The authorized user, working on the secure Census Bureau network, will use the CCBMR with full information in authorized domains. There is no duplication of effort, and the project will implement fully automatic disclosure avoidance review of the metadata where feasible. The preservation function operates indefinitely on the original scientific inputs as long as the researchers cooperate and the agency continues to fund the preservation component of the CCBMR. Doctoral students will be taught how to develop research programs using restricted-access Census Bureau data and the repository tools developed in this project in combination with previously developed tools. The same tools will be used to develop computational statistics algorithms based on boosting to improve the integration, editing, and imputation models that assemble the micro-data used for the Census Bureau's longitudinally linked employer-employee database.<br/><br/>Because the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 formalized the obligation of every statistical agency in the United States to take long-term custody of the confidential micro-data used for its work, all federal statistical agencies face the same problem as the Census Bureau. The CCBMR, the education based on this repository, and the collaborative computational statistics model all can be generalized to meet the restricted-access research requirements of other statistical agencies. These tools allow statistical agencies to harness the efforts of researchers who want to understand the structure and complexity of the confidential data they intend to analyze in order to propose and implement reproducible scientific results. Future generations of scientists will be able to build on those efforts because the long-term data preservation in the CCBMR will operate on the original scientific inputs, not inputs that have been subjected to statistical disclosure limitation prior to entering the repository. This curation will result in a viable system for enforcing data management plans on projects, ensuring that results can be tested and replicated by future scientists. This activity is supported by the NSF-Census Research Network funding opportunity.","crimson"

For the vast majority, at most only subtle effects have been detected. Plant genetics is poised to progress rapidly in remedying this situation, using a collection of ""knockout"" mutant strains of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockouts, carrying a tiny tagged segment of disruptive DNA in one targeted gene, are already available for ~67% of the 27,000+ unique genes in this plant's genome. Inspired by progress in yeast genetics, the project will grow large subsets of these knockouts in benign and challenging environments, quantifying ecological performance attributes (e.g., population growth rate, fruit yield). We predict that, as in yeast, such an approach will reveal important phenotypic differences between mutant and control lines and possibly reveal undiscovered genome-wide patterns. The project is a collaboration of primarily undergraduate institutions and will train young scientists in how major genomic questions are addressed by networks of researchers. <br/><br/>The project will involve screening 7000 available T-DNA lines to identify those that have mutations at only one gene, providing these results to the biological community.

In dietary specialists, anatomy may limit these movements to those that are ideal for chewing a narrow range of foods. In contrast, generalists may be capable of more variable movements to deal with broader diets. Given these potential differences in the adaptability of the chewing movements, the role of input from oral sensory receptors may also differ between generalists and specialists. The goal of this study is to determine how oral sensory information and morphology interact to influence the complex jaw and tongue movements that occur during mastication in mammals. Understanding the link between anatomy and diet has been a cornerstone of studies of mammalian biology and evolution but there are no comparative studies on the contribution of oral sensation to chewing movements and coordination within the context of dietary evolution. Results will shed light on potential selective pressures influencing the evolution of sensory and motor systems involved in mastication, a behavior that is implicated in the early evolution and radiation of mammals. In conjunction with the scientific outcomes of this project, PIs will contribute to public school education, public outreach, training of scientists at all levels and the development of research infrastructure. The Williams lab will work with the Ohio University Department of Education, the South East Ohio Center for Excellence in Mathematics and Science, WOUB Public Media and local public school teachers to develop and implement educational modules on evolution, adaptation and functional morphology for middle and high schools. The Gerstner lab will conduct interactive science activities at local schools, and public venues and field institutes in Michigan and Utah. Both PIs will provide interdisciplinary research training for undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral associates. Data will be made available through public online databases and FDA methods will be disseminated through the web-accessible Comprehensive R Archive Network.<br/><br/>Mastication involves very complex, small and fast movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. In each chewing cycle, jaw movements align the teeth to break down food. The tongue, supported by the hyoid, maintains the food on the teeth. Morphological specializations for diet influence these movements, as do interactions between oral sensory receptors and central and peripheral motor systems. Currently, we do not know whether dietary adaptations influence an animal's range of kinematic responses to changes in sensory stimuli, or how oral sensory systems relate to the adaptive profile of diverse species. Using X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), this project will determine how 1) morphological specialization for diet impacts chewing kinematics and 2) movements are affected in the absence of oral sensory feedback. XROMM allows the continuous measurement of the 3D masticatory movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. Comparisons will be made between 4 dietary generalists and 4 phylogenetically-matched specialists. Data are first analyzed by extracting predetermined kinematic variables from continuous movement profiles. As this approach leaves most of the data unanalyzed, the final aim of this work is to develop and test new analytic tools under the rubric of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and compare results to the previous analyses. FDA is an ideal partner for XROMM because it analyzes the entire movement profile. Results will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings.","teal"

In industrial and post-industrial democracies, citizens often participate in science and technology (S&T) decision-making and implementation. Civic science and technology literacy, or public understanding, among the adult general public is tacitly understood to help create a climate that facilitates intelligent policy discussions, supports the ""science enterprise,"" and enhances quality of life. Overall, the general public may resist some developments, e.g., genetically modified foods, while adopting others, e.g., the Internet. In addition, many stakeholders--parents, educators, legislators, and employers--are concerned that the United States is ""falling behind"" in science education or failing to develop sufficient numbers of S&T professionals. Given engagement in and reaction to science and technology, it is imperative to periodically gauge S&T knowledge among the general public, as well as their understanding of how science is conducted. Examining S&T knowledge and attitudes among adults can help educators plan more effective coursework; it also may help encourage greater diversity in science and technology fields. For example, comparing engineer and scientist stereotypes may provide insight into young adult choices of more applied versus more theoretical research careers. Examining how general public adults perceive concordance among scientists (e.g., about global warming) may suggest how to communicate what is--or is not--controversial in science, helping citizens to evaluate more accurately information from diverse experts. The project addresses several of these concerns, by examining how gender, ethnicity, and dimensions of education, relate to civic science and technology literacy over time and by generation.<br/><br/>The project analyzes data from The National Science Foundation Surveys of Public Understanding of Science and Technology (The NSF Surveys), 1979 -2016. The NSF Surveys examine repeated cross-sectional probability surveys of American adults. Initially (1981-2001) most were random digit dial telephone interviews. More recently (2006-2016) the General Social Survey (GSS) has conducted in-person interviews. Questions address science knowledge and attitudes, understanding science inquiry, information technology access, stereotypes about scientists and engineers, perceptions of scientists' activities, and extensive demographic information, especially about education. Several analyses center on how basic S&T knowledge links to science inquiry understanding, and how both relate to background variables, and changes over time and by generation. For example, some current analyses of older adults' use of information technology confound age, time period, and generation, and thus may contribute to covert age discrimination among employers who want ""tech-savvy"" workers. Such analyses require updating a data archive spanning 1979-2006, amalgamating it with newer GSS surveys from 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016. A second database incorporates in-depth items on adult understanding of science processes, making possible comparisons with responses from youth on the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Statistical analyses on this project include regression, analysis of variance, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, structural equation models, Multiple Classification Analysis, and loglinear models, including mediators and moderators. Results are disseminated through professional channels and also in reports more accessible to general audiences.","gray"

This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples. The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing). Indirect influences on neural and dental development, such as gestation length and diet, will also be used as variables.<br/><br/>The broader implications of the study include a web-based atlas and digital archive of histological and CT images from the specimens. The interactive online atlas will be developed as a resource for anatomists, who will benefit from animal models for aspects of human development, and primatologists, who will benefit from the resource on development of primates. In addition, animations which highlight the importance of growth mechanisms for evolutionary adaptation will be created and made available to advanced K-12 students and their teachers as online educational tools.","maroon"

The US Ice Core Working Group recommended in 2003 that NSF pursue the means to take replicate samples, termed ""replicate coring"". This recommendation was part of an agreement to reduce the diameter of the (then) new drilling system (the DISC drill) core to 12.2 cm to lighten logistics burdens, and the science community accepted the reduction in ice sample with the understanding that replicate coring would be able to provide extra sample volume in key intervals. The WAIS Divide effort would particularly benefit from replicate coring, because of the unique quality of the expected gas record and the large samples needed for gases and gas isotopes; thus this proposal to employ replicate coring at WAIS Divide. In addition, scientific demand for ice samples has been, and will continue to be, very unevenly distributed, with the ice core archive being completely depleted in depth intervals of high scientific interest (abrupt climate changes, volcanic sulfate horizons, meteor impact horizons, for example). The broader impacts of the proposed research may include identification of leads and lags between Greenland, tropical, and Antarctic climate change, enabling critical tests of hypotheses for the mechanism of abrupt climate change. Improved understanding of volcanic impacts on atmospheric chemistry and climate may also emerge. This understanding may ultimately help improve climate models and prediction of the Earth System feedback response to ongoing human perturbation in coming centuries. Outreach and public education about climate change are integral components of the PIs' activities and the proposed work will enhance these efforts. Broader impacts also include education and training of 2 postdoctoral scholars and 1 graduate student, and invaluable field experience for the graduate and undergraduate students who will likely make up the core processing team at WAIS Divide.","plum"

In dietary specialists, anatomy may limit these movements to those that are ideal for chewing a narrow range of foods. In contrast, generalists may be capable of more variable movements to deal with broader diets. Given these potential differences in the adaptability of the chewing movements, the role of input from oral sensory receptors may also differ between generalists and specialists. The goal of this study is to determine how oral sensory information and morphology interact to influence the complex jaw and tongue movements that occur during mastication in mammals. Understanding the link between anatomy and diet has been a cornerstone of studies of mammalian biology and evolution but there are no comparative studies on the contribution of oral sensation to chewing movements and coordination within the context of dietary evolution. Results will shed light on potential selective pressures influencing the evolution of sensory and motor systems involved in mastication, a behavior that is implicated in the early evolution and radiation of mammals. In conjunction with the scientific outcomes of this project, PIs will contribute to public school education, public outreach, training of scientists at all levels and the development of research infrastructure. The Williams lab will work with the Ohio University Department of Education, the South East Ohio Center for Excellence in Mathematics and Science, WOUB Public Media and local public school teachers to develop and implement educational modules on evolution, adaptation and functional morphology for middle and high schools. The Gerstner lab will conduct interactive science activities at local schools, and public venues and field institutes in Michigan and Utah. Both PIs will provide interdisciplinary research training for undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral associates. Data will be made available through public online databases and FDA methods will be disseminated through the web-accessible Comprehensive R Archive Network.<br/><br/>Mastication involves very complex, small and fast movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. In each chewing cycle, jaw movements align the teeth to break down food. The tongue, supported by the hyoid, maintains the food on the teeth. Morphological specializations for diet influence these movements, as do interactions between oral sensory receptors and central and peripheral motor systems. Currently, we do not know whether dietary adaptations influence an animal's range of kinematic responses to changes in sensory stimuli, or how oral sensory systems relate to the adaptive profile of diverse species. Using X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology (XROMM), this project will determine how 1) morphological specialization for diet impacts chewing kinematics and 2) movements are affected in the absence of oral sensory feedback. XROMM allows the continuous measurement of the 3D masticatory movements of the jaw, tongue and hyoid. Comparisons will be made between 4 dietary generalists and 4 phylogenetically-matched specialists. Data are first analyzed by extracting predetermined kinematic variables from continuous movement profiles. As this approach leaves most of the data unanalyzed, the final aim of this work is to develop and test new analytic tools under the rubric of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and compare results to the previous analyses. FDA is an ideal partner for XROMM because it analyzes the entire movement profile. Results will be disseminated through peer reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings.","teal"

The fire science community is small, fragmented and geographically dispersed. The present project is an effort to meet the resulting organizational challenge, to promote high levels of integration and coordination, and to provide a critical mass of researchers for topics central to computational fire research. The project will build on established programs in the U.S. aimed at producing computer models for engineering analysis of building fires, e.g., the Fire Dynamics Simulator developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and FireFOAM developed by FM Global. The project will contribute data and software modules to a new open-access web-based repository, develop physics-based guidelines for computational best practices, and produce a new series of online tutorials for graduate-level students. The project will also advance fundamental knowledge and develop engineering-level tools for the generic problem of fire spread along solid flammable materials.<br/><br/>The project is proposed as part of a new initiative led by the International Association for Fire Safety Science (IAFSS) called ""the IAFSS Working Group on Measurement and Computation of Fire Phenomena"" (or the MaCFP Working Group). On the technical side, the project will focus on the problem of turbulent wall flames supplied with fuel vapors produced by the thermal degradation of solid flammable materials. The project will include performing both fine-grained (research-level) and coarse-grained (engineering-level) large eddy simulations. Coarse-grained simulations will require the development of new wall models for turbulent boundary layer flames. The simulation software adopted in the project is the free open-source fire model called FireFOAM. On the organizational side, the project will support the MaCFP Working Group effort, develop an open-access web-based digital archive of well-documented numerical simulations corresponding to selected target experiments, help identify key research topics and knowledge gaps in computational and experimental fire research, develop best practices in computational fire research, contribute to the organization of the new MaCFP workshop series, and help develop an international network of fire researchers and a community-wide forum for discussion and exchange of information.","coral"

Today, however, Gaelic remains a community language only in the most remote regions of western Scotland. Gaelic speakers comprise about 1% of the Scottish population; the 2011 census found only 57,375 native speakers, compared to 250,000 a century earlier. This sharp decline makes the language's continued survival uncertain. <br/><br/>Scottish Gaelic is of immense interest because it possesses many rare linguistic features, including initial consonant mutation where a word-initial consonant can be changed depending on what the function of that word is in a clause. Scottish Gaelic also exhibits pre-aspirated consonants, and verb-initial sentence structure. In addition, Scottish Gaelic offers remarkable examples of how knowledge systems particular to its local geography and climate (land management, fishing techniques) are imbedded in the language. Should Gaelic become extinct, the global community -- not just Scotland -- will lose an irreplaceable cultural and scientific resource. <br/><br/>Through this two-year project for $189,457, Professors Ian Clayton from the University of Nevada, Reno along with Andrew Carnie and Mike Hammond from the University of Arizona will create a corpus of linguistic interviews with 30 native Gaelic speakers, with the help of native speaker Muriel Fisher (recipient of the Linguistic Society of America's 2015 Excellence in Community Linguistics Award). Speakers will represent a range of ages, geographic origins, and professional backgrounds. The collection will contain more than twenty hours of high-quality audio-visual material, transcribed and translated, with both cultural and scientific value. The collection will offer an invaluable tool to help linguists expand their scientific study of the language's rare features. In addition, the interviews will focus on traditional occupations, folklore, and oral history, the kinds of knowledge and terminology most at risk as Gaelic declines. <br/><br/>When complete, the corpus will be publically available through the Max Planck Institute's Language Archive, and the University of Arizona's Open Repository.","maroon"

Recent studies using DNA sequence data have provided evidence that myxozoans are related to cnidarians (jellyfish, corals and sea anemones). Although superficially, these microscopic parasites do not bear any resemblance to cnidarians, they have a similar complex intracellular structure. In myxozoans this structure is called a polar capsule and is used to attach to its host for infection.

Using parallel multi-tiered and computationally robust analyses, the project will address two important biological questions: How does gene regulation in the stem cells (meristem) of roots and shoots differ across species? How does environmental stress influence the development of specialized cell types in the root? The findings will provide insights that could facilitate downstream improvement of abiotic stress tolerance.

A product of this effort will be a 10-year strategic plan that will outline the implementation of bio- and climate monitoring programs and a data management program at the BFS and describe how these programs can be incorporated into curricula at the Claremont Colleges and collaborating institutions. These planning efforts will have a regional research focus to provide diverse research opportunities for students at the Claremont Colleges and exploit the unique location of the Claremont Colleges to play a leadership role in regional ecology and biodiversity research.<br/><br/>This planning effort will facilitate communication among researchers interested in Southern California ecosystems and enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about the biota in Southern California and the environment that sustains it. The Claremont Colleges expect that collaboration among researchers and land managers will also result in the development of new regional multi-disciplinary projects. As such, this planning effort will indirectly enhance opportunities for underrepresented groups by encouraging the collaboration among regional colleges and universities, many of which are less than 100 miles from each other and have their own local field stations or preserves.","puce"

The AMO has been shown to influence precipitation over North America and Europe, and is linked to rainfall and drought over Northeast Brazil and the Sahel. The AMO is thought to be linked to the overturning circulation of the North Atlantic, so that slower overturning results in the cold phase of the AMO, while faster overturning leads to the warm phase.<br/><br/>While previous studies have focused on the impacts of the AMO on precipitation and drought during the summer season, work here addresses the possibility of an AMO influence on Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation and consequent weather and climate impacts during the winter. The particular effect hypothesized here is that the AMO influences the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large-scale fluctuation of sea level pressure and wind which affects the weather and climate of Europe and North America. The expected relationship is such that the warm phase of the AMO favors the negative phase of the NAO, which is characterized by a more meandering jet stream and increased incidence of cold air outbreaks. Research to test this relationship includes analysis of the 20th Century Reanalysis (20CR) dataset, in which atmospheric weather and circulation fields are reconstructed based on surface barometer readings from 1871 to 2010, along with SST records from the same time period. The observational analysis is augmented with numerical model simulations intended to capture the atmospheric response to imposed AMO SSTs, and these simulations are further compared to the archive of coupled climate model simulations prepared for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5). The research will also consider the possibility that the AMO affects the NAO indirectly, as warm SSTs lead to reduced Arctic ice cover, which in turn affects atmospheric circulation.<br/><br/>A better understanding of the effects of the AMO on the NAO is desirable due to the impact of the NAO on the severity of winters in the US and Europe, particularly given that the slow variation of the AMO could imply some level of predictability for winter conditions. In addition to the societal benefit of the research results, the work will have broader impacts by supporting a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in climate research. In addition, the researchers will participate in an outreach program titled ""Climate Literacy Empowerment And iNquiry (CLEAN). The program is targeted at elementary and middle school children.","fuchsia"

The project will seek answers to a set of important questions, including the following: Who owns the wind? Who enjoys the benefits of positive downwind impacts on crops and other wind plants? Who bears responsibility for negative downwind impacts of newly constructed wind turbines? This project will quantify the atmospheric and economic impacts of wind farms to more accurately assess the complex implications of new wind farms on both natural and human systems. The investigators also will propose nationwide legal frameworks that accurately reflect the physical and economic impacts on wind farms' neighbors. Appropriate legal guidance can result in greater efficiencies and reduce waste of wind resources. Because it will couple physical, economic, and legal investigations, the project will help to reduce the frequency of adversarial, litigation-based solutions and maximize public benefit in a fair and predictable manner, thereby providing the policy tools to optimize the development of the nation's sustainable energy resources. This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.<br/><br/>The production of energy from wind has increased significantly over the past decade, and projections suggest this increase is likely to continue. The establishment of more turbines in large wind farms brings the growing risk of impacts on local environments, crops, and other wind farms, however. The investigators will integrate atmospheric science and economic impact studies along with systematic legal analyses to more effectively characterize the complex interactions among natural and human systems downwind from wind farms, and they will provide new insights regarding policy and other approaches to maximizing benefits while reducing risks. The researchers will use publicly available weather prediction to simulate wind farm impacts, which then will be compared to extensive datasets of wind, turbulence, and turbine power production data from three large wind farms in different regions of the country. If improvements to the representation of wind farms in weather models are required, these improvements will be made and made available for weather forecasters and others. The investigators will analyze the economic impacts of wind development on landowners within a wind farm and on downwind neighbors, and they will assess local, state, and national wind case law in order to understand whether and how wind farm atmospheric and economic impacts are accurately represented by current legal frameworks. This categorization and analysis will provide a new resource to other wind law researchers. The weather simulations and aggregated economic and legal data created in this project will be maintained on a publicly available data archive to enable future investigations of wind energy economic and legal impacts.","maroon"

A current challenge is to understand how crop plants regulate the formation and function of their roots. An understanding of the genes that control roots at this level would help plant breeders tailor root traits to match new agricultural practices, land use patterns, and suboptimal soils. In this project, genome-wide gene expression will be defined from roots and root hairs from a wide range of crop plants and their relatives under various environmental conditions. These gene expression patterns will be analyzed to identify key genes that control the formation and function of roots. Further, these large gene expression datasets will provide a valuable tool for scientists studying many aspects of root biology. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to provide new insight into the origin, diversification, and conservation of molecular mechanisms used to regulate the formation and function of roots and root hairs of plants. Further, given the important roles of roots/root hairs for plant growth and environmental response, these findings are expected to assist the rational design of strategies to manipulate root and root hair architecture in crop plants, a particularly important goal given concerns about nutrient-poor soils and the impact of environmental change. This project will provide strong interdisciplinary training for the participating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. A major outreach activity of this project is a collaborative research visitor exchange program with the College of Charleston (SC), a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide large-scale genomic and computational biology experiences to students who are unable to obtain this training at their home institution. The project will participate in the Michigan Biological Scholars Program, a bridging program assisting first-year undergraduates in the life sciences, especially underrepresented minorities. Finally, aspects of this research will be incorporated into a semester-long laboratory exercise as part of an advanced molecular development course at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/>With the rapidly expanding gene and genome sequences available in plants, it is now possible to consider the ultimate goal of defining the gene activities present in every organ and cell type in species throughout the plant kingdom. This knowledge would dramatically improve the understanding of plant processes and their diversity, and will likely lead to new opportunities for manipulating crop plants. This project is designed as a first step toward this ultimate goal by defining gene expression in a simple plant organ (the root) and a simple plant cell type (the root hair) in diverse plant species. In a preliminary study, expression data has been generated from seven species (rice, maize, soybean, cucumber, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Selaginella), demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research. This project has two major objectives. The first is to identify sets of regulatory genes associated with specific root structural and functional traits, by defining transcriptomes from the three major zones of activity for the primary roots and other root types from a diverse set of crop plants. In the second objective, cell-specific regulatory genes will be defined by linking gene expression and cell characteristics in the root hair cells from these same plant species grown under normal and nutrient stress conditions. The results of this project are expected to have a significant impact on the plant research community, through the generation of root-zone-specific and root-hair-specific expression data from many diverse species, which will assist efforts to assign function to unknown genes, predict functional homologs, and assess gene evolutionary history.

These stellar halos extend far beyond the crowded inner regions of galaxies, where the majority of the stars reside in disks or dense spheres. Stellar halos are thought to be made of stars that formed very early on, in the galaxy's newly formed disk, as well as stars that were originally part of smaller, dwarf, galaxies that fell into the large galaxy and were torn apart. The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo. Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow. They will deduce the properties of destroyed ""dwarf"" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nowlan Freese is ""Regulation of stress response in salt-stressed rice through the modulation of alternative splicing by methylation."" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Ann Loraine. <br/><br/>A fifth of the world's daily calories come from rice. Changing environmental conditions can impact agricultural production significantly, and so it is particularly important to understand how rice plants respond and adapt to stress conditions. This project investigates how rice genomes respond to salt stress through changes in the DNA that alter the way gene information is passed on. The process, called ""alternative splicing,"" alters parts of genes resulting in differences in gene products. This project will identify the molecular mechanisms that drive alternative splicing during salt stress, providing the foundational information for researchers to explore new frontiers in genomics and for breeders to develop salt tolerant varieties of rice in the future. The Fellow will be trained in bioinformatics, statistical data analysis, and methods in plant molecular biology. This project also provides information and research experience to high school students to facilitate understanding of basic science concepts in the relevant context of environmental change.<br/><br/>In plants, exposure to abiotic stress triggers genome-wide changes in splicing patterns, enriching for stress-specific transcript isoforms. However, the mechanism through which stress pathways regulate splicing remains largely unknown. In rice, salt and other abiotic stresses alter DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification that can enhance stress tolerance. Evidence from animal systems suggests that DNA methylation within genes influences co-transcriptional splicing by defining intron/exon boundaries. This project will determine if a similar link exists in plants by investigating the connection between DNA methylation, alternative splicing, and stress response in salt-stressed rice. The objectives are to identify salt-induced isoforms that result from splicing in two rice varieties, investigate the role of methylation and identify specific splice variants.

This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples. The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing). Indirect influences on neural and dental development, such as gestation length and diet, will also be used as variables.<br/><br/>The broader implications of the study include a web-based atlas and digital archive of histological and CT images from the specimens. The interactive online atlas will be developed as a resource for anatomists, who will benefit from animal models for aspects of human development, and primatologists, who will benefit from the resource on development of primates. In addition, animations which highlight the importance of growth mechanisms for evolutionary adaptation will be created and made available to advanced K-12 students and their teachers as online educational tools.","maroon"

The PBO is a geodetic network with 1,100 GPS stations covering the Western US, designed to study the geology of the boundary zone between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. Although the GPS receivers were installed to monitor plate movements, the PIs showed under an earlier award (EAR-1144221) that the measurements can also be used to produce estimates for the above surface hydrology variables through a method called GPS Interferometric Reflectometry (GPS-IR). GPS-IR uses interference between GPS signals received directly from the transmitting satellite and signals which are reflected from the ground before arriving at the receiver. The reflected signal is sensitive to the moisture content of the soil and surface vegetation, as well as the change in effective surface height due to snow cover. Work under the previous award produced a dataset with data beginning in 2011.<br/><br/>Work under this award augments the existing dataset by extending the period of record back to 2007 and by increasing the sampling rate at each site to daily or sub-daily frequency. The key to accomplishing these goals is the use of the L2P ""legacy"" GPS signals. Because the L2P signals are encrypted and thus more difficult to use, the existing dataset was developed using the unencrypted L2C signals, which have been tracked at the PBO sites since 2011. The backward extension of the dataset will be accomplished by developing more sophisticated algorithms which can be used with the L2P signals, available in the PBO archive starting in 2007. A further issue is that the algorithms initially developed by the PIs were limited to use on signals transmitted from satellite positions in a somewhat narrow wedge of the sky to the south of the receiver. Improvements to the algorithms now allow the use of transmissions from a much wider range of directions, enabling an increase of the sampling rate to daily or sub-daily frequency. Funds under this award support the development and application of new algorithms to augment the dataset, validation of the augmented data against in-situ measurements, comparisons between data generated from the L2P and L2C signals, generation of decade-long climatologies, and continued data collection throughout the period of the award.<br/><br/>The primary motivation for funding this work is the value of the dataset for researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders concerned with surface hydrology. Surface hydrological variables like soil moisture, snow depth, and vegetation water content are essential for understanding the water cycle, yet they are difficult to make and only sparsely available. The GPS stations of the PBO constitute a remarkable opportunity, given that the PBO is already fully established and funded for other purposes. The hydrological data thus substantially enhances the value of the network with minimal additional field costs. Beyond its scientific value, the data has high societal relevance given concerns in the western states regarding water resources. In addition, the project will support a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate, and will also support student interns through the NSF-supported Research Experiences in Solid Earth Sciences for Students (RESSES) summer program. Algorithms and data developed under the project will be freely accessible online.","fuchsia"

While EarthCube will provide an unprecedented framework for disseminating data sources, the use of real-time data raises an additional set of complex challenges that must be considered.

Many geo-scientific experiments are often resource constrained. In such cases it is vital to guarantee the optimal allocation of resources to ensure that important events do not go unobserved. In geo-scientific domains it is not uncommon to analyze data after a field campaigns, only to detect sensor faults, calibration offsets or anomalous behaviors when it is already too late. Real-time data will enable the optimal allocation of constrained experimental resources by automating the detection of faults and anomalies. CHORDS will provide a framework to enable adaptive sampling, discovery and fusion of various real-time geoscientific data sources, thus facilitating a new means by which geoscience experiments are carried out. The use cases will illustrate this by showing traditional experiments would have missed events of interest due to lack of access to real-time data. Focus on the initial work of defining requirements, design and specifications. Begin to ingest a small subset of geosciences data streams into a prototype CHORDS structure built in the cloud. Participate in activities that strengthen the integration of real-time data being ingested via CHORDS into other EarthCube Building Block systems that are under development.

R2R's work plan included uploading and classifying the end-of-cruise data distributions from each vessel operator; publishing an online catalog of vessels, cruises, datasets, and science parties; preparing and submitting the data to the NOAA Data Centers for long-term preservation; assessing the quality of selected data sets and providing quality feedback to operators; creating a standard set of data products including quality-controlled ship-track navigation, geophysical profiles (gravity, magnetics, bathymetry), and real-time meteorology/near-surface oceanography; and developing an event logging application to document at-sea operations. The R2R program team worked in close collaboration with the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) Office, vessel technicians, NOAA Centers, other NSF-funded ocean data systems, disciplinary specialists in the research community, and international partners. All UNOLS operating institutions, as well as the NSF-supported Coast Guard Cutter (CGC) Healy, now routinely submit their cruise data to R2R. R2R has achieved its primary objectives during its initial five years of operation. Renewed funding will enable transition from a ""development"" focus to an ""operational"" focus. Work in the next five years includes continued operation of core infrastructure developed in the first phase of funding, as well as selected new tasks designed to improve R2R's products and services in response to community feedback.<br/><br/>Benefits of R2R will extend to key stakeholders including vessel operators, research scientists, <br/>cyberinfrastructure developers, funding agencies, and the general public. R2R will provide tools and feedback to help marine technicians improve data quality and documentation, and will free them from the need to maintain a local data archive. A central cruise catalog for the academic fleet will ensure that original field data from every cruise are routinely preserved and disseminated, improving access for scientists and the public and simplifying funding agency efforts to enforce data sharing requirements. Standardization of data acquisition procedures across the fleet will facilitate integration with observations from other platforms such as NSFs Ocean Observatories Initiative, while enabling new synthesis efforts for a global ocean that is vast and sparsely explored.","lavender"

Globally, it has become increasingly clear over the last few decades that the return flow of bottom water to the surface ocean in the ""conveyor belt"" is far from the quasi-uniform upward motion and circulation that was originally envisioned. A high resolution analysis of the deep and abyssal circulation for the entire Northeast Pacific basin will be conducted using all available historical data and model statistical and numerical methods. The project will also answer a long-standing question about the origin of the North Pacific double silica maximum. The investigator for this project has a leading role in undergraduate education in Oceanography at the University of Washington and will use the results from this study to illustrate to students the complexities of the real-world processes underpinning the simple schematics that are commonly found in discussions of the role of the deep ocean circulation in long-term climate variation. The investigator will publish and archive the three-dimensional fields of ocean properties on the University of Washington Oceanography website. These fields may be helpful to other researchers for uses ranging from experiment design to better understanding of tracer distributions in the deep North Pacific. Finally, the work will provide support and training for an undergraduate and a graduate student.<br/><br/>The first objective of the project is to test a hypothesis about how circulation fields relate to the North Pacific double silica maximum. The North Pacific hosts a striking mid-depth maximum of dissolved silica (Si), a regenerated nutrient important for ocean biogeochemistry. Previous work noted a second much denser maximum of Si over the western flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, with an intervening Si minimum that precludes a simple upwelling connection between bottom water and mid-depth in this region. The hypothesis then was that the mid-depth Si plume is fed from the bottom of Cascadia Basin, located east of the ridge. Recent work revealed that Cascadia Basin sources are not sufficient to maintain this feature. The working hypothesis for this project is that the additional source lies west of the ridge, requiring a connection - one that is surprisingly complex - via a convoluted upward-spiraling route south along the western flank to a deep gap just north of the Mendocino Fracture Zone, and then north into Cascadia Basin along the eastern flank of the ridge system. Along this flow path, bottom heating and diapycnal mixing decrease the density of the fluid until it spills over the bounding ridges to feed the mid-depth plume. The downstream part of the flow path through Cascadia Basin has been documented in recent work by the investigator who proposes a detailed analysis of the upstream western flank flow, applying a similar geostrophic inverse methodology. The second objective is to extend the inverse calculation to the entire region east of the dateline and north of 25 N at unprecedented resolution. An analysis using data available before 1990 revealed surprising complexity to the deep circulation in the Pacific, in the form of distinct regions of meridional transport in the west and east, connected by multiple zonally-elongated deep gyres, but more recent studies disagree. A detailed analysis of the northeast Pacific overturning at higher resolution, and using a fundamentally different inverse technique based on the potential vorticity budget, will be used to yield new insight on this issue, as well as other unanswered questions.","lavender"

It takes advantage of long term archaeological data to examine a process of interactional caused change which continues today in many parts of the world. The project will examine Native American life during the late prehistoric period when some Appalachian communities underwent a process of cultural transformation identified by archaeologists as Mississippianization. The long process of Mississippianization (AD 900-1500) that unfolded in many Native American communities across the midwestern and southeastern United States is identified archaeologically by similarities in artifact styles and community practices. How, then, did mountain communities respond to Mississippian practices that they encountered? How does the process of social integration or resistance play out in household activities and in public contexts? Is change expressed differently at sites that experience differing degrees of contact? Using recent excavations at a Pisgah village site (the Cane River site) and analysis of previously excavated collections from this site and from a mound and village center (the Garden Creek site), this research will compare the archaeological assemblages and spatial organization of both household and community activities across the central Appalachian Summit during a time of major cultural transformation. The goals of this project are (1) to investigate the extent to which Mississippian contact and exchange influenced major Pisgah settlements and (2) to evaluate how these changes affected community practice within the ecology of the Appalachian Summit. This research has the potential to generate a more comprehensive picture of early Mississippian emergence and interaction across a peripheral geopolitical region. This will inform Mississippian studies across the Eastern Woodlands, as well as provide greater insights into early complex pre-state formations at multiple scales of social interaction.<br/><br/>This research on Pisgah communities will have broader impacts on local community education, broader collaboration among regional archaeologists, and participation and involvement with descendant communities. Excavations behind a local middle school facilitated an investment of the project into community education and stewardship. By utilizing educational opportunities during excavation and making use of existing archaeological collections, this project preserves the in situ archaeological record while simultaneously acknowledging the collections curated in nearby universities. This project has engaged other stakeholders, including archaeologists from the Pisgah National Forest and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians, and facilitates a more robust understanding of the archaeological record in western North Carolina while ensuring that results and findings are shared with descendent communities. Results and data will be shared through peer-reviewed publications and the online digital archive for archaeological data, the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR). Public outreach will include instillation of a local museum exhibit and lectures given at local museums and conferences.","maroon"

But how do young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species? Here, the researchers investigate the genomic, neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of species recognition employed by avian brood parasites, birds whose eggs are laid into nests of strangers and whose chicks are raised by the foster species. By identifying the password--a species-specific vocalization that attracts and initiates the neural mechanisms by which young brood parasites identify individuals of their own species--the researchers will be able to understand how young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species. This work will contribute broadly to scientific progress in the fields of learning and memory, behavioral plasticity and behavioral evolution. This research program involves training of students and young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of students, including many underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in integrative behavioral, neurobiological, and genomics research techniques. The participants will deliver public seminars and exhibits at Sylvan Heights Bird Park in North Carolina and at several non-profit organizations in New York City.<br/><br/>The suite of behavioral innovations underlying social parasitism, including avian brood parasitism, must include mechanisms to recognize conspecifics without prior exposure during early development. This project will tap into the developmental knowledge already gathered from parental songbirds, including the zebra finch model system, and focus the ontogenetic study on a closely-related, but obligate parasitic finch, the pin-tailed whydah. The aim is to test the general hypothesis that differences in neural architecture or processing between parasitic and parental birds reflect evolutionary tinkering, whereby novel traits arise by modification of existing networks and structures. Through experimentally manipulated exposure of juvenile parasites to songs, the prediction will be tested that conspecific recognition relies on hearing a salient species-specific character, termed the password. Detailed quantitative patterns of transcriptional change following password exposure, and throughout developmental landmarks, will be collected to identify neurogenomic signatures associated with the timing and induction of conspecific recognition and to more broadly define the molecular basis of experience-dependent or developmentally driven neuroplasticity. Critical acoustic and behavioral components of these data will be collected during a newly developed field course in Puerto Rico. Acoustic and video data will be made freely available through DataOne, a public data repository, and genomic data will be deposited into the National Institutes of Health's NCBI short read archive.","teal"

Among the most important and basic climate system components are the heat, freshwater, and carbon content and transport of the oceans, which directly interact with other essential components of the climate system in the atmosphere and cryosphere. In turn the associated variability and trends in the ocean's carbon content, carbonate saturation state, oxygen, and nutrients impact its internal biological environment, with notable large-scale regional changes. This joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is critical to identify critical areas where changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic carbon uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean's transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements. Results to date have shown that the abyssal ocean is warming, taking up to 30% of the excess heat in the entire Earth system, leading to changes in circulation patterns and ventilation rates in the upper ocean. The uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean has been mapped and shows that the oceans are acidifying. Oxygen concentrations are declining in the ocean thermocline, and tropical oxygen minimum zones are expanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community and need to be made quickly and freely available to the community at large through a recognized international data center. The project will continue to promote training and learning for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists in sea-going work. Outreach activities will continue as opportunities arise.<br/><br/>The systematic and global re-occupation of select ocean hydrographic sections conducted for the past decade (2003-2014) will be extended into the 2015-2020 period with the continued objective of quantifying changes in the full-depth ocean. The project is in support of the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. This long-standing project continues to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers. This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data. Post-cruise data updates, distribution, and archive will continue to be managed by groups with separate funding. This ongoing project is integrated with a larger international effort to monitor the ocean's response to climate change.","lavender"

Beginning in 1965-66, Principal Investigator Dr. James Matisoff has devoted much of his scholarly activity to the documentation of this language, including a 693-page Lahu grammar (1973/82), a 1500-page Lahu-English dictionary (1988), and a 472-page English-Lahu lexicon (2006).<br/><br/>Most of the PI's work on Lahu has been based on the voluminous corpus of texts he collected in Northern Thai villages in the 1960's, recorded on reel-to-reel tape-recorders and transcribed in longhand, then corrected during subsequent fieldtrips in the 1970's. These texts comprise a wide variety of genres and registers, including descriptions of daily activities, often enacted in the form of skits or playlets; conversations (e.g. on village life and its hardships); jokes and anecdotes; trickster tales; fables and other stories with a moral; traditional love poetry and songs; pre-Christian myths and prayers from the animist tradition; Christian sermons, hymns, and Bible readings. They reflect a cultural milieu nearly half a century old, before the profound changes in village life of recent decades. Many of the words and expressions in these texts are no longer in common use, and are sometimes unintelligible to current generations of speakers.<br/><br/>About 130 of these 170 texts have already been translated by the PI. In the spring of 2011, the Lahu transcriptions were entered into the computer by a visiting Lahu graduate student from Thailand. During the projected two-year grant period, the following steps will be undertaken: (1) completion and revision of the free translations; (2) interlinear glossing of every morpheme in each text; (3) copious annotation, both linguistic and cultural; (4) formatting the texts and translations for publication in the University of California Publications in Linguistics series. The printed volume will be accompanied by a time-aligned electronic archive of the original audiotapes from the 1960's and 1970's.<br/><br/>In order to ensure maximum usefulness to the Lahu people themselves, the texts will be presented in all three of the orthographies now in use: the Baptist missionary system used by the Lahu in Burma and Thailand; the pinyin-based orthography used by the Lahu in China; and the PI's phonemic orthography used in his grammar, dictionaries, and articles on Lahu. The end result will be a volume of several hundred pages, which will be of interest to scholars in a variety of humanistic and social scientific disciplines, and most importantly, to the Lahu people themselves.","maroon"

But a large amount of this record, especially for the Middle Indo-Aryan and Early New Indo-Aryan period, remains unexplored linguistically. This project will contribute to filling this gap by undertaking an investigation of the nature of the linguistic transition from the Late Middle Indo-Aryan period to the New Indo-Aryan period (500 CE--1500CE). Dr. Ashwini Deo's research will focus specifically on studying the evolution of tense, aspect, and modality systems in the New Indo-Aryan languages. <br/><br/>This research builds on two subprojects. The first subproject aims to digitize a set of diachronic texts created between 500CE and 1500CE, thus creating an electronically accessible and searchable corpus for the period of interest. The second subproject involves taking a closer look at the contemporary linguistic situation for under-documented members of the Central and Southern subgroups of Indo-Aryan for clues about the structure of the parent Middle Indo-Aryan system. Undertaken in concert, these two methodologically distinct, but thematically unified subprojects will yield a picture of the Indo-Aryan historical situation of much higher resolution than either of them undertaken in isolation. Further, these data will be crucial to answering broader theoretical questions about the systematic nature of semantic change, the mechanisms of change, and paths of evolution in tense/aspect systems in natural languages.<br/><br/>The project aims, from the very outset, to create a platform for making the processed textual and field data (metadata) accessible to the broader research community via a dedicated website. A sizeable corpus of electronic texts as well as a comprehensive bibliographic database of material on Middle and New Indo-Aryan will be made publicly available. Further, a complete archive of documented materials will be maintained for the fieldwork done. The intellectual infrastructure generated by the project can be thus employed more generally for future research on Middle and New Indo-Aryan.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by NSF's International Science and Engineering office.","maroon"

To obtain maximum return it is necessary to develop methods to integrate and analyze large bodies of data which extend across multiple sites and projects. This research project serves to further that goal.<br/>Radiocarbon dating is the primary method that North American archaeologists use to document the ages of archaeology sites, and millions of dollars in federal funding has been spent in obtaining those dates. With large samples of such dates, archaeologists can generate ""summed probability distributions"" to reconstruct population histories. These population histories provide an important piece of North America's ancient history: where and when did populations rise and decline? The database this project will create will provide researchers with a useful tool to investigate many different problems in several disciplines. <br/><br/>Compiling the dates is time-consuming, since there are tens of thousands, and since they are published in many different places, including on the web, in books, journals, monographs and in grey literature. In addition, it is not simply the dates themselves that must be compiled, but also their associated information that researchers need to ""clean"" the database and create a sample useful for their research. Dates will be compiled for California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana from existing regional databases, through ""deep dive"" web searches, and crowd-sourcing to professional and amateur organizations. The major (private sector) radiocarbon labs have also offered to assist. Eventually, the compiled dates and associated information will be made publically available through the Canadian Archaeological Radiocarbon Database, which will have a Google Earth link so that both temporal and spatial patterns in date (population) distributions can be studied. Researchers will be able to upload dates easily in batches to this database to keep it current. Although the focus is on western North America, the intention is to extend the database to the eastern U.S. as well. It is anticipated that this will become the world's largest database of radiocarbon dates. <br/><br/>Summed probability distributions of radiocarbon dates are commonly used as measures of prehistoric population sizes. Therefore, this database will leverage research into all population-related phenomena in North America. Researchers can use it to test hypotheses (a) of how human population responds to climate change, technological innovation, emigration, and disease; (b) that relate behaviors such as warfare, migration, and technological innovation to population pressure; (c) drawn from genetic data, e.g., that hypothesize population bottlenecks. Such a database will transform how hypotheses are tested and consequently how one understands North American prehistory.<br/><br/>This project will (a) create a free, public archive for researchers that will enhance the research infrastructure of archaeology in the academic community and the private (CRM) sector and benefit educational institutions with a resource for student projects and class demonstrations; (b) help move North American archaeology toward its next frontier, ""Big Data,"" since archaeology's strength is its ability to see patterns across vast reaches of space and time; and (c) this project will help catalyze a shift in the culture of American academic archaeology by moving it toward a model that is more typical of researchers in the physical and natural sciences that create databases as research tools.","maroon"

Yet the subtropics are also home to the world's monsoon systems, including the Asian, West African, and North and South American monsoons, and are thus characterized during the monsoon seasons by strong east-west contrasts between regions of heavy rainfall and neighboring drylands. Given the substantial portion of the world's population inhabiting the subtropics, it is of interest to understand how the strong hydrologic contrast between monsoon regions and drylands will change in response to changes in global mean temperature. Climate model projections of 21st century climate change generally suggest that such contrasts will intensify, but there is little quantitative agreement from one model to another on the magnitude of the intensification. And while several mechanisms have been proposed to account for the intensification, a generally accepted theory for the behavior is still lacking.<br/><br/>This project examines changes in the subtropical hydrological contrasts by considering changes in the zonally asymmetric component of the subtropical atmospheric circulation, including the asymmetric vertical mass flux which is upward over monsoon regions and downward over the drylands. This approach differs from previously work which emphasizes the zonal-mean circulation (e.g. the widening of the Hadley cell and the subtropical belts) and explanations in terms of energetics, atmospheric stability, and increased moisture content. It is based on preliminary work using a simpled idealized climate model in which ocean heat flux covergence is imposed over a patch of the subtropics to induce locally warmer sea surface temperatures and enhanced precipitation, which further induces subsidence and dry conditions to the west. Based on the results of these experiments, three hypotheses are posed: 1) The increase in tropopause height that occurs as global mean climate warms enhances the vertical mass flux in stationary circulations, thereby increasing zoanl asymmetries in precipiation; 2) zonal sea surface temperature gradients decreases as global mean climate warms, weakening stationary circulations and the hydrological contrasts they induce; and 3) the mechanism in hypothesis 2 applies over land, only with surface air equivalent potential temperature playing the role of sea surface temperature, so that the land surface water budget plays a role. The research agenda consists of an examination of the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of subtropical asymmetric circulations in present-day climate from observations and simulations, followed by an examination of future climate simulations from an archive of climate models, all guided by the results of the simple idealized model.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of the work come from the substantial portion of the world's population inhabiting the subtropics and the potential impacts of hydrological cycle change on agriculture, water resources, and other necessities of life. The development of a robust theoretical and conceptual understanding of hydrological cycle change would have significant benefit for improving confidence in model projections of future climate change and for guiding future model development. The project also supports and trains a postdoctoral research associate and a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area. The project also supports education and outreach to local high school students.","fuchsia"

A critical time of paleoenvironmental and biotic turnover, this interval witnessed the origin of modern terrestrial ecosystems. The Hayden Quarry (HQ) represents a unique opportunity to establish an extensive multi-million-year biotic-paleoenvironmental archive from nonmarine strata. HQ and associated localities in the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation of northern New Mexico provide an unparalleled window into the evolution of terrestrial vertebrate ecosystems, including the rise of dinosaurs. The extremely well-preserved fossils of HQ include at least 12 major groups of Late Triassic vertebrates sampled from over 15,000 collected specimens. This project has two major goals: 1) to establish an integrated record of paleoenvironmental and faunal change in Upper Triassic strata of northern New Mexico; and 2) utilize the extraordinary HQ vertebrate assemblage to elucidate the evolutionary history of early Mesozoic archosauromorph reptiles. This project represents one of the first integrated studies of biotic response to paleoenvironmental changes in a terrestrial ecosystem during the rise of dinosaurs.<br/> Broader Impacts: PIs discoveries are assimilated into the education curriculum and new exhibits at the Ghost Ranch Museum of Paleontology, exposing over 2,000 K-12 students from Rio Arriba County to science (where 70% of residents belong to population groups traditionally underrepresented in science), including through class site visits to the Hayden Quarry itself. To date, forty-five graduate and undergraduate students from nine different institutions have participated in and received training through our Ghost Ranch field project. This project provides funding for a minimum of four graduate students and six undergraduates in fieldwork and research, including support for underrepresented groups in the geosciences (e.g., African-Americans and women). Research will be disseminated through both scholarly and popular publications, as well as media press releases (e.g., http://www.nsf.gov/tawa). Finally, data generated by the project will be contributed to NSF-supported publically accessible databases such as MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org) and the Paleobiology Database (http://paleodb.org/).","hot_pink"

The investigation will focus on understanding the seasonal formation of carbonate minerals in soils. The project will consist of three components: laboratory experiments, computer modeling, and application of experimental and modeling results to a geological problem. The anticipated results will be of interest to a wide range of disciplines including those within the earth, biological, and soil sciences. Throughout this fellowship period Dr. Gallagher will actively convey the importance of environmental change to the general public through participation in events such as the University of Texas K-12 oriented Forty Acres Fest. In addition, he will mentor graduate students and develop and supervise independent research projects for undergraduates. Dr. Gallagher will co-teach an undergraduate environmental isotope geochemistry course, developing new assignments designed to expose students to the power and utility of computer modeling.<br/><br/>The research project will take the novel approach of pairing experimental soil manipulations with cutting-edge reactive transport modeling in order to gain a thorough understanding of processes driving<br/>pedogenic carbonate formation. The research plan will include (1) experimental manipulation of soil columns where different seasonal patterns of precipitation are simulated, (2) use of reactive transport models to place the experimental results of the research into a quantitative and predictive framework, and (3) application of the experimental and modeling results to a geologic case study centered on pedogenic carbonate derived paleoelevation histories of Andean uplift. Carbonate minerals in soils are an important archive of past environmental conditions, that is widely used by the scientific community for reconstructing past climatological, ecological and tectonic changes. The accuracy of these paleo-reconstructions is hindered, in large part because the processes controlling the seasonal timing of pedogenic carbonate formation have not been fully characterized. It is expected that this investigation will contribute to this knowledge gap.","hot_pink"

This award will provide management and operations support for this facility. Significant geologic processes occur over a wide variety of time-scales. Catastrophic changes, large debris flows or floods, occur over short time-scales but other changes, such as long-term erosion of landscape or glacial cycles occur over longer time-scales, thousands to millions of years. These changes nonetheless play a dominant role in landscape evolution and directly impact the welfare of human populations world-wide. Measuring the rates of these processes and reconstructing a chronology for them is a challenge and geoscientists employ a number of tools to extract this information from the geologic archive. Cosmic-ray produced nuclides, especially those measured by accelerator mass spectrometry, are now routinely used to obtain chronologies and determine erosion rates for significant geologic processes. In the last decade these nuclides have been used to reconstruct glacial chronologies, which in turn provides a record of past climates. They have also been used to show linkages between tectonic activity and erosion rates. The pursuit of these studies has involved PhD students and researchers from dozens of universities within the US. At PRIME Lab they not only learn how to perform the physical and chemical preparation of samples, but they also participate in the measurement of their samples on the PRIME Lab accelerator mass spectrometry system. The interaction between students, faculty, and professional staff at PRIME facilitates interaction with geologists, chemists, and physicists, providing a near unique opportunity to expand the educational opportunity beyond the focus of the research projects. <br/><br/>With continued NSF support, PRIME Lab will continue utilizing the unique capabilities of a larger accelerator for the benefit of the geoscience community. Given the limited number of multi-isotope facilities in the US, we anticipate growth in the number of measurements (and sample preparation) required by the geoscience community. In addition to more routine measurements, we are the only laboratory in the US positioned to advance the state-of-the-art using a gas-filled-magnet. We have already demonstrated the efficacy of the instrumentation for 10Be, 26Al, and 36Cl, especially 26Al. For the next five years, PRIME Lab will continue to advance the application of cosmogenic nuclides in the geosciences through increased productivity of routinely measured nuclides and by the development of new measurement technologies and applications harnessing these advances.","hot_pink"

The focus is on what makes people successful rather than what makes them fail. It was developed through a partnership between the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Office for Community Health (OCH) at the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Northwestern University. The project is also interdisciplinary, partnering researchers from Anthropology, Psychology and Economics/Public Health with AISES to contribute a unique perspective on Native participation in STEM. The aim of this research is to identify the role of culture, individual identity, epistemology and bi-cultural efficacy in this process. The guiding hypothesis is that AI-AN success in STEM is influenced by dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity, with the role of bi-cultural efficacy being particularly significant. The researchers are interested in knowing: (a) What factors positively influence AI-AN success in STEM?; (b) What role do the dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity play in AI-AN success in STEM and how are these dynamics played-out in individual experience?; and (c) Does bi-cultural efficacy play a role in this process, and if so, what is that role?<br/><br/> The proposed collaboration uses a mixed methods design, beginning with an ethnographic approach that will build on advances in knowledge from the extensive literature on deficits and barriers, and nascent research on epistemology, adding new empirical data. The research consciously privileges voices of Native scholars whose experience is not well represented in mainstream perspectives or taken into consideration by policy makers. Adaptive project design through iterative data collection and analysis with synthesis and incorporation of findings from different components ongoing throughout the study will allow for dynamic inclusion of participant input. The study includes four separate but integrated research components: (1) 75 in-depth ethnographic interviews with 25 AI-AN STEM professionals and AISES members, conducted in three iterative sets of 25 each; (2) Three AI-AN undergraduate Student Research Scientists (SRS) from UNM will be mentored in the conduct of 36 peer interviews (12 each) with other AI-AN students; (3) Secondary analysis of unique AISES organizational archive with 35 years of information on more than 6000+ AI-AN involved in STEM; and (4) a preliminary survey will be conducted in year three of the project with 25 AISES members to validate measures of bi-cultural efficacy that contribute to AI-AN success in STEM. The Principal Investigators will mentor Native scholars to develop protocols, collect and analyze data, present findings, and participate as members of the Research Team. A Project Summit in Year Three will disseminate project findings to a broad group of AISES stakeholders. This project will also structure a new role for AISES to play in the STEM community by leveraging the unique position of AISES as a national AI-AN STEM organization and developing data collection protocols and data collection tools the organization can continue to use for research in the future. <br/><br/> Results of this research will increase understanding of how AI-AN individuals leverage personal and cultural assets in a way that embraces a congruency between Indigenous culture (Native science) and Western science as they achieve success in STEM. This information will contribute to the literature analyzing issues in AI-AN education and under-representation in STEM and indicate directions for future research. Most importantly, this research may lay the foundation for increasing the proportion of AI-AN scientists. Factors that contribute to success and achievement of AI-AN in STEM are often unrecognized, underappreciated or poorly understood. The improved coherence of interventions that will result from better conceptualization of the strengths and needs of AI-AN students will provide a roadmap for developing best-practice and model-driven programming within universities, improve AI-AN educational outcomes in STEM, and in turn, contribute to improvements in AI-AN individual and community well-being.","azure"

However, in critical politically and socially charged settings an acceptable level of trust is difficult, especially since current technologies allow easy forging, manipulation and fabrication of data. The goal of this project is to design and build a mobile data technology with increased authenticity and integrity assurances. Of primary importance is the proof that data have been captured live on the actual mobile device and not fabricated. The new framework will more accurately verify that mobile data and the device sensor streams simultaneously captured are factually related and act as the required witness to the authenticity of reported data - a fundamental role in establishing the credibility of mobile and social media. Applications with important social impact include citizen journalism, smart city management and prototype verification.<br/><br/>The project will investigate, develop and evaluate a framework for secure and efficient sensor-based mobile data verification mechanisms. In a first thrust, the team will leverage TrustZone to build a trusted mobile device platform to bootstrap trust into sensor readings captured on the device and provide secure storage and a secure execution environment for sensitive functions. In a second thrust, the team will devise solutions to securely and efficiently capture, authenticate, communicate, archive, search, and access mobile device sensor snapshots (""sensorprints"").

Today, however, Gaelic remains a community language only in the most remote regions of western Scotland. Gaelic speakers comprise about 1% of the Scottish population; the 2011 census found only 57,375 native speakers, compared to 250,000 a century earlier. This sharp decline makes the language's continued survival uncertain. <br/><br/>Scottish Gaelic is of immense interest because it possesses many rare linguistic features, including initial consonant mutation where a word-initial consonant can be changed depending on the function of that word in a clause. Scottish Gaelic also exhibits pre-aspirated consonants, and verb-initial sentence structure. In addition, the language offers remarkable examples of how knowledge systems particular to local geography and climate (land management, fishing techniques) are imbedded in the language. Should Scottish Gaelic become extinct, the global community -- not just Scotland -- will lose an irreplaceable cultural and scientific resource. <br/><br/>Through this two-year project, Professors Ian Clayton from the University of Nevada, Reno along with Andrew Carnie and Mike Hammond from the University of Arizona will create a corpus of linguistic interviews with 30 native Gaelic speakers. They will be assisted by native speaker Muriel Fisher, the recipient of the Linguistic Society of America's 2015 Excellence in Community Linguistics Award. The collection will contain more than twenty hours of high-quality audio-visual material, transcribed and translated and will include speech samples from speakers over range of ages, geographic origins, and professional backgrounds.<br/><br/>The collection will offer an invaluable tool to help linguists expand their scientific study of this language's rare features. In addition, the interviews will focus on traditional occupations, folklore, and oral history-- the kinds of knowledge and terminology most at risk as Gaelic declines. <br/><br/>When complete, the corpus will be publically available through the Max Planck Institute's Language Archive, and the University of Arizona's Open Repository.","maroon"

Using next-generation sequencing approaches, genetic lines that contain differentiated genes involved the origin of species will be mapped in the genome and their gene products will sequenced. The approach taken is to 1) to test the co-localization of song and preference genes, 2) translate the results into a nucleotide genome map to generate candidate genes underlying behavioral change, and 3) build a data set of expressed genes that associates with different behaviors. A targeted genome assembly and gene annotation will also be undertaken. Data will be stored and available based upon type of data. WAV files will be stored on DYRAD (www.dyrad.com), while sequence data will be deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive. <br/><br/>The project will have multiple broader impacts. Many of the fascinating behaviors that illustrate principles in behavioral ecology and evolution come from ""non-model"" organisms whereas the genetic insights into behavior often come from ""model"" genetic organisms. The integration of natural behavioral variation (male signal and female preference) with advanced genomic approaches provides a bridge between model-genetic study and natural behavioral systems. Insights promise one of the best empirical and conceptual bridges to explain diversification. From the education and outreach perspective, the project will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and efforts to reach out to the public will continue via contributions to public science centers and museum events centered on insects.","teal"

Although there exists a large body of knowledge on the distribution and character of rocks and the resources they contain, there is currently no framework for consolidating this information, for placing it into a larger context, or for analyzing it quantitatively. This is unfortunate because the processes that form and destroy rocks are discontinuous and selective in time and space, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous distribution of materials at Earth's surface.<br/><br/>Macrostratigraphy uses rock packages compiled separately at different geographic locations as a framework for integrating diverse Earth science data sets and for quantitatively analyzing the rock record. Macrostrat (macrostrat.org) currently consists minimally of the ages, thicknesses, general rock types, names, and many economic uses for >21,521 rock units from >830 geographic locations in North America. This CAREER research will use the data currently in Macrostrat as a scaffolding upon which to build a much more rigorous and complete body of knowledge on the distribution of rocks, their material properties, and their resource potential here in North America. A three-front approach will be taken to accomplish this task. First, data for new locations will be compiled from the literature and entered into the Macrostrat database. Second, a powerful new web application will be built upon Macrostrat and this will be used to enable the participation of geologists at state geological surveys, academic institutions, and the energy industry. Finally, existing locations will be updated with modern data from the literature and the field. The resultant new data compilation will not only enable the specific hypotheses concerning the geological history of carbon burial and patterns of sedimentation outlined in the proposal to be tested, but it will also serve as a platform for characterizing existing resources and formulating a new generation of questions in many domains of Earth science.<br/><br/>Knowing where rocks occur today and when they formed in Earth history is so central to geoscience and resource discovery that it is hard to overestimate the broader impacts of assembling new, comprehensive quantitative data on the rock record and then making those data publicly accessible via intuitive and location-aware web applications. The motivations for building such web-applications stem from the fact that (1) many primary field observations are of great analytical value, particularly in combination with macrostratigraphic context, (2) many citizens who are not trained in science are nevertheless often curious about their immediate environment, and (3) some types of geological field data can be produced by nearly anyone, including students and engaged citizens, when they are provided with location-based context for their own observations. One of the most important end results of this project will be a new set of research and teaching tools that can serve needs of professional geologists while at the same time more constructively engaging students and 'citizen scientists' in the scientific process.","hot_pink"

However, in critical socially charged settings it is difficult to ascertain and assert an acceptable level of trust, especially as current technologies allow easy forging, manipulation and fabrication of data. The goal of this project is to design and build technology that will endow mobile data with increased authenticity and integrity assurances. Of primary importance is the data ""liveness"" assurance, or proof that the data has been captured live on the actual mobile device, and has not been fabricated. This project will identify and exploit the insight that mobile data and the device sensor streams simultaneously captured, necessarily bear certain relations. This research plays a fundamental role in establishing the credibility of mobile and social media, acting as the required witness to the authenticity of reported data. Applications with important social impact include citizen journalism, smart city management and prototype verification.<br/><br/>The project will investigate, develop and evaluate a framework for secure and efficient sensor-based mobile data verification mechanisms. In a first thrust, the team will leverage TrustZone to build a trusted mobile device platform, to bootstrap trust into sensor readings captured on the device, and provide secure storage and a secure execution environment for sensitive functions. In a second thrust, the team will devise solutions to securely and efficiently capture, authenticate, communicate, archive, search and access mobile device sensor snapshots (""sensorprints""). Finally, the team will develop mechanisms to verify the consistency between mobile data and simultaneously captured sensor streams.

It marks the end of the global warm conditions of the early Paleozoic that lasted ~150my and occurred under elevated pCO2 conditions. Considerable doubt has recently been raised with regard to the duration of the LOG, its potential driving mechanisms, and pre-glacial, long-term temperature variations. For instance approximately 15 Ma prior to LOG the North American continental plate was situated in tropical to subtropical latitudes, but sedimentological and paleontological evidence suggest a shift from deposition of warm water carbonates to deposition of cool water carbonates. It is not clear whether this sedimentological change reflects global cooling (indicating significant perturbation to the global climate system well before the Late Ordovician glaciation) or physical responses to tectonic activity with no requisite climatic implications. <br/>The projects will test competing hypotheses that try to explain this event through an extensive geochemical study. In particular, PIs will use the geochemical archive of conodont apatite (delta18O and epsilonNd) and carbonates (DELTA48, delta18O, and delta13C) to address questions about paleoceanographic conditions during the Early Late Ordovician. They expect that this research will lead 1) to clarification of potential causes for the paleontological/sedimentological changes during this interval, 2) to a better understanding of epicontinental sea circulation and an improved facies model for epicontinental low latitude carbonate platforms (for which no modern-day analogues exist), and 3) to better documentation of the temperature history of the Ordovician greenhouse interval.<br/>This research project will have active participation by undergraduate students, graduate students, and a secondary school science teacher. Therefore, the project will not only impact present university students and researchers, it will also impact future generations of students through enhancing an earth science secondary educations teacherï¿½ï¿½s knowledge base and science curriculum. Data will be contributed to publicly accessible databases making them available for further research and general education in the fields of paleoclimate and paleoceanography.","hot_pink"

This study will extend this work using output from reanalyses, model simulations from the CMIP5 archive, and experimental CESM model runs to investigate how and why the ongoing loss of arctic sea ice and high-latitude terrestrial snow cover may cause mid-latitude weather patterns to change. Past and projected patterns in 500 hPa heights will be analyzed using a combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) ? a neural-network-based technique that reduces large data sets to their representative patterns ? a new meridional circulation index, and an extreme weather index to address the hypothesis that Arctic Amplification of past and future global climate change promotes circulation patterns that favor extreme weather events in middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The PIs suggest that changes in the energy budget of the arctic surface, because of sea-ice loss and earlier snow melt on high-latitude land, reduce meridional thickness gradients, which induce generally weaker zonal flow aloft and higher amplitude circulation features. They think these upper-level flow patterns slow the eastward progression of large-scale atmospheric Rossby waves, favoring more persistent weather conditions that increase the probability of extreme weather such as cold-air outbreaks, heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. They believe the primary physical mechanism driving the change is an enhanced and seasonally varying arctic heating: in fall/winter it is ocean-based associated with substantial sea ice loss, while in warmer months it is land-based due primarily to earlier snow melt and reduced soil moisture. Higher-amplitude flow trajectories may also exacerbate sea-ice and snow-cover loss, thereby constituting a positive feedback loop.<br/><br/>Because extreme weather events, such as temperature and precipitation extremes, are often caused by high-amplitude, slow-moving upper-level circulation patterns, this analysis will focus on detecting and characterizing these patterns, interpreting the weather conditions associated with them, and identifying regions that are likely to be affected. This study attempts to connect arctic change with the rest of the global climate system.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Changes in extreme weather as a result of greenhouse gas accumulation will directly and dramatically affect millions of people across the globe, thus a better understanding and more accurate future projection of changes in the frequency, location, and severity of droughts, floods, and temperature extremes are urgently needed by decision-makers at all levels of society. Preliminary work has already attracted world-wide attention via articles in prominent newspapers, radio interviews, interviews for the Weather Channel, magazine articles, and numerous online blogs. This will also be an opportunity for a new post-doc. The PIs will prepare a module for the NSF-supported ?Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears? project for K-5 teachers. Both PIs make frequent public and school presentations on climate-change related issues, and because extreme weather is so relevant to society at large, results from the proposed study will figure prominently into these presentations.","plum"

The oceans act as the flywheel of the climate system, playing major roles in the climate, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, global energy budgets, and sea level rise. Study and understanding of this component of the Earth System requires integrated multi-disciplinary investigations with access to oceanographic data of biological, chemical, geological, and physical origin. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created to serve PIs funded by the NSF Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and the Division of Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program as a facility where marine biogeochemical and ecological data and information developed in the course of scientific research can be managed and made publicly available. BCO-DMO provides integrated chemical, biological and physical data inventories from a number of large and intermediate-sized programs, as well as single investigator projects. BCO-DMO also provides scientific investigators the opportunity to explore complex and multifaceted datasets and supports cross-disciplinary collaboration to address pressing environmental questions, problems, and challenges that are exacerbated with the increasing pace of climate change. The BCO-DMO collection of datasets contributed by researchers funded by NSF and others is a publicly available resource accessible via the BCO-DMO website. BCO-DMO supports synthesis and modeling activities, reuse of oceanographic data for new research endeavors, availability of ""real data"" for classroom use by teachers and students at K-12 and college level, and provides decision-support field data for policy-relevant issues. BCO-DMO outreach activities include participation in community training courses and workshops both national and international, and help to foster long-term collaborative partnerships between data management professionals and research investigators. These outreach activities reduce community barriers by fostering the sharing of ideas among synergistic, but otherwise independent research groups. BCO-DMO actively participates in the exchange of knowledge at oceanographic and informatics meetings, an important mechanism by which standards development and adoption occurs. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the BCO-DMO data management repository is to manage existing and new datasets from NSF funded individual scientific investigators and collaborative groups of investigators, and to make the data available online. The BCO-DMO data management system is composed of a metadata database and the distributed client-server JGOFS/GLOBEC data system, plus text-based and map-based user interfaces and support for machine clients to access the information and data available from the repository. The office works with principal investigators and other data contributors to support all phases of the data lifecycle; maintain an inventory of projects, deployments, and datasets; generate standards-compliant metadata records as required by federal agencies; promote compliance with the NSF Ocean Sciences data policy; ensure submission of data to national data centers for archive; support and encourage data synthesis by providing enhanced data discovery and access systems; facilitate interoperability among distributed data repositories; and facilitate regional, national, and international data and information exchange. The office participates in the development and use of open-source, standards-based technologies that enable interoperable data systems to exchange data and information that will foster next-generation research in all disciplines. As the analysis of ocean processes becomes more and more sophisticated, multidisciplinary data integration will also grow more complex. BCO-DMO fosters information sharing and is committed to being a fundamental component of the ocean science research infrastructure without which the goals of existing and future ocean research programs cannot be met.","lavender"

The 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand Earthquake Sequence included four major earthquakes that produced high levels of ground shaking in the Christchurch metropolitan region. These earthquakes triggered thousands of rockfalls, which impacted several hundred buildings and resulted in both human and capital losses. However, the impact of these rockfalls on structures varied widely. In some instances boulders became enmeshed within a building's structural system, causing damage but preserving life-safety. In other situations boulders fully penetrated building systems and caused structural collapse. While a rockfall's interaction with a building system may be conceptually understood to be a function of both impact energy and structural capacity, it still remains unclear exactly how these factors govern a building's resistance to these impacts. There is virtually no information on this in the engineering literature. This work will be the first extensive, well-documented study of the subject and will be of immediate use to engineers in all parts of the world where rockfalls are a potential threat. <br/><br/>To this end, this research seeks to acquire, process, and archive data pertaining to the impact of rockfalls on a series of common residential and commercial structures. This study will be accomplished through geo-referenced, 3D, ground-based LIDAR scans and Structure from Motion (SfM) photographic acquisition at approximately 30 damaged buildings. In addition to documentation at high detail, the resulting database will provide a substantial increase in the number of high-quality case histories of rockfall-structure interaction. This work additionally aims to identify the factors that govern the resilience of a wide range of common structures through a preliminary series of coupled runout/structural impact model simulations of the rockfall process. The project includes a range of broader impacts including most notably development of preliminary guidelines on building system resilience to rockfalls. These guidelines will have important implications for building codes worldwide and more immediately will serve to inform local rebuilding and recovery efforts in Christchurch. The work will be done in close cooperation with researchers from GNS Science, New Zealand.","navy_blue"

Although predictions vary, it is likely that the future will bring alterations to current weather patterns, with impacts on temperature and precipitation in particular. Research is needed to understand how these changes will affect agricultural productivity and to investigate whether the geographical ranges of crops and native plants will shift. This project uses genetic and genomic approaches to discover how the long-lived grass switchgrass and its relatives are able to respond and adapt naturally to environmental stresses in a range of diverse habitats. A major focus of the research is to identify genes involved in local adaptation and drought tolerance across a latitudinal gradient in the US. Ultimately, this information will provide a basis for understanding how plants adapt to varying conditions and will provide tools to engineer stress resistance crops. Undergraduate students will be engaged in the project and will gain hands-on research experiences that span disciplinary and continental boundaries.<br/><br/>Although there is compelling evidence for local adaptation in plants, the genetic basis underlying these adaptations is not fully understood. In particular, it is unclear how genetic trade-offs at individual loci underlie the overall pattern of adaptation or the spatial scale of those effects. Moreover, the role of epigenetic ""memory"" of stress in perennial plants and their long term adaptation is largely unexplored. The integrative research in this project investigates local adaptation and acclimation in Panicum grasses. The specific objectives are to (1) conduct field QTL experiments to test for divergence, local adaptation, and genotype-by-environment interaction in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes, (2) fine-map and clone drought tolerance QTL in diploid Panicum hallii, (3) investigate the ecological and molecular drivers of drought legacy effects, and (4) conduct genome scans of climate adaptation in Panicum hallii. Another major goal is to train the next generation of plant scientists through an REU-type program that engages Freshman undergraduate students in research at the start of their education. The findings from this project will facilitate ongoing efforts to engineer crops for higher performance under drought conditions, one of the major limitations in agricultural productivity. All sequence data will be deposited in the NCBI short read archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and at Phytozome (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html).

Today, over 56 million people in the United States report some degree of disability, a number which will likely grow in coming years as the so-called ""baby boomer"" generation ages. RESNA, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, is the one organization with an international focus that is devoted solely to technology for individuals with disabilities. RESNA's membership consists of individuals and institutions covering a range of disciplines (including researchers, clinicians, suppliers, manufacturers, consumers and educators who work in both non-profit and for-profit settings), all of whom are dedicated to promoting the exchange of ideas and information for the advancement of assistive technology. The annual RESNA Conference and the Student Design Competition combine to create a forum for interaction between working and experienced rehabilitation engineers and students who are about to enter the field. Unique in its primary focus on undergraduates, the event provides participants with experience and skills that help them succeed in their engineering and design careers. It encourages and mentors students in various disciplines to become involved in the assistive technology and rehabilitation engineering fields, and provides an opportunity for the students to network with their peers as well as participants in previous SDCs, many of whom are now leaders in service, research, and education related to technology for people with disabilities. Furthermore, continuing a practice started a few years ago, all participants (not just the finalists) will create blog posts that capture and archive their submissions, and these will remain accessible indefinitely through the RESNA website and the AT Wiki. Thus, those who teach will be able to share this information with their students as examples of projects that others have done, while service providers and people with disabilities will be able to search for unique solutions to barriers they may face. More information about RESNA and its annual conference is available online at http://www.resna.org while information specific to the SDC may be found at http://aac-rerc.psu.edu/wordpressmu/RESNA-SDC and student team entry abstracts are included on the AT Wiki http://atwiki.assistivetech.net/index.php/ATWiki_Home.<br/><br/>The RESNA Student Design Competition fosters innovation and creativity with the ultimate goal of producing technology that can contribute to the independence of individuals with disabilities. The first SDC was held in 1980 as part of the inaugural RESNA conference; since then over 260 designs have been identified as winning entries from among over 800 submitted by students from over 125 different universities and institutes of higher learning. Both undergraduate and master's level graduate candidates are eligible to submit entries, which must represent the work of students only; no faculty or professionals may be included as co-authors, although faculty may be mentioned as advisors and/or mentors. NSF has been a supporter since 2005. This year's funding will enable the SDC to be further expanded and enhanced, so as to include more entries and support for more design teams, especially from minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities. A call for participation has been posted on the conference website, and also distributed electronically to a large number of colleges and universities with engineering and design schools. A team of 5 judges will pre-select up to 6 semi-finalist teams, from which two members each will be invited to attend the conference fully supported with travel and hotel funds as well as complimentary registration. At the beginning of the conference these teams will make presentations and show off their working prototypes to the judges before a public audience, and 5 finalist teams will be selected. Judges will have an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions and recommendations to the design teams. The conference schedule includes a platform session on Wednesday, July 13 in which the finalists will present their designs to the general conference audience; in addition, finalists will have an opportunity to present their projects during the Annual Developers' Forum on Tuesday evening, July 12, which highlights new products under development (some past SDC student team designs have been patented and are now available commercially).","indigo"

The combination of visiting research programs with a small permanent faculty and postdoctoral fellows enables interactions among visiting scientists to occur with lasting impact. As a largely peer-managed institute, with essential input in the planning and implementation of its research programs from the community, the KITP responds to new scientific opportunities, encourages transformational research, and promotes diversity by ensuring broad representation. The programs, which attract select groups of participants from institutions worldwide, are designed to enhance interaction and collaboration among participants in order to stimulate the vibrant, creative thinking that leads to insight and significant scientific progress. The KITP strives to reach out to new scientific communities and to foster inter-disciplinary research, at the crossroads between Physics and allied fields, such as Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>The research programs of the KITP cover all the traditional areas of theoretical physics: Condensed Matter Physics, Astrophysics, High-Energy and Particle Physics, String Theory and Mathematical Physics, Atomic Physics and Optics, Gravitational Physics and Relativity, as well as Biological Physics. The Advisory Board chooses KITP programs with a 1.5-2 year lead time, in response to proposals submitted by the community. The Board, which rotates membership on a three year cycle, is broadly representative of the national physics community, and is instrumental in conveying to the Institute the desires, the suggestions and the complaints of the community, as well as serving as a pool of potential organizers for programs. The choice of programs is dictated by the excellence of the science, the potential for successful advances, the timing of the program and the potential for synergy with programs running in parallel. Special attention is given to programs that span different fields, such as Atomic and Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Information and Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Field Theory and Mathematics, Biology. and Physics, and Climate Science. Almost all NSF funds are used to support the expenses of the visitors, the infrastructure of the programs and the KITP postdocs. In a typical year, the Institute runs 8-12 research programs, lasting 1-6 months long. At any given time there are two or three overlapping programs, with about 20-25 visitors resident in each program. This results in more than 1000 visitors per year and a total of approximately 23,000 visitor-days per year.<br/><br/>The Institute offers an exciting experience for young theorists. Postdoctoral fellows are exposed to more different aspects of theory and to more scientists than at any other institution, providing unique opportunities to develop broad perspectives and begin independent research. The Graduate Fellows program offers an opportunity for advanced graduate students matriculated elsewhere to spend 5-6 months participating in KITP activities and broadening their grasp of physics. Participating scientists at KITP can bring their students with them as Affiliates. All in all, there are about 10-20 graduate students at the KITP at any given time. In order to bring forefront physics to as large an audience as possible, the KITP has developed a web site that covers all Institute activities. Audio recordings, transparencies, PowerPoint, web-cam images, computer graphics, and video of all talks, seminars and the four yearly public lectures are posted on the Web. This archive now contains over 10,000 talks, and receives over 95,000,000 hits per year (including over 30 million hits on the public lectures), resulting in over 73,500 hours of audio streamed to the world. All program talks are recorded and all conference talks are put on the Web in almost real time. A Journalist-in-Residence program (supported by private funds) enables communicators of science to come to KITP for insight into what theoretical physicists are thinking and doing, and to share with interested scientists tips about communicating science. The KITP Scholars program supports the research efforts of faculty not working at major research institutions by funding two-week annual visits to KITP. The annual spring Secondary School Teachers conference brings teachers from around the United States to participate in talks and discussions on a topic associated with one of the concurrently running scientific programs.","forest_green"

GPS technology embedded in collars (mammal) or backpacks (birds) has revolutionized the ability to track animals, providing more detail than ever before, sometimes in real-time. However, to make the most of these new tracking data they must be seen in the context of the world through which the animals are moving by linking their tracks to remote sensing maps showing weather and ecosystem. With both the animal and environmental data growing rapidly, there are increasing technical challenges and knowledge gaps that inhibit the widespread application of linking these types of datasets for movement ecology research. The Environmental-Data Automated Track Annotation system (Env-DATA) is a web-based tool to give direct access for movement ecology researchers to thousands of environmental datasets. It provides intuitive and easy to use graphic user interface-based access to these datasets. Env-DATA is hosted by and interfaces with Movebank, a global movement data archive, open to the broad public worldwide. Env-DATA is open and accessible to anyone. It provides easy access to already public datasets, as well and some datasets that are not otherwise open. Env-DATA provides users with tools to publish the combined environmental data along with the animal track it was used to annotate in the Movebank Data Depository. Published data sets are allocated a DOI and can be accessed and searched as electronic publications, provided an agreement from the owner of the track data. Annual workshops at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will reach out to new users within academia, government, and public organizations that track animals.<br/><br/>Env-DATA is at the cutting edge of the ""contextual revolution"" in movement ecology where combining analysis of movement patterns and incorporating the environmental background of the movement has become a necessary component for understanding and modeling animal movement. By providing intuitive and easy to use access to an unprecedented number of environmental datasets and variables, Env-DATA enables animal movement researchers to overcome technical challenges and knowledge gaps, and to fully utilize globally available environmental information. Env-DATA links movement tracks with environmental data from different remote-sensing and global reanalysis data providers, including NASA, NOAA, and ECMWF. Env-DATA interprets environmental variables in the correct encryption, grid, and projection systems and interpolates the data in space and time to the observed animal track locations, or a collection of comparison points or grid. Funding through this proposal will allow support of continuous on-going operations of Env-DATA, which requires regular quality control tests to detect cases where the data providers to Env-DATA may have changed the metadata, location, or access protocol. In these cases, technical support to update the system is necessary. It also requires regular availability of a user-support ""help-desk"". Outreach and training of new and existing users, as well as collecting first-hand feedback from users will be conducted by annual user workshops. All talks and tutorials in the workshop will be filmed and posted to the workshop website and on YouTube. Env-DATA PIs, staff, and researchers using Env-DATA will provide lectures to the broad public in the NC Museum. Undergraduate students will assist in workshop coordination and Env-DATA user support.

William Rutherford and Martin Buck (Imperial College London)<br/><br/>Nitrogen is most often the limiting nutrient to plant growth. While multiple bacteria and archaea have evolved the ability to fix atmospheric dinitrogen gas into biologically available ammonia using the nitrogenase enzyme, biological nitrogen fixation lacks wide applicability in agriculture. First, the process is energetically expensive. Second, all well-studied nitrogenase enzymes are inhibited by oxygen and require special structures to function effectively. However, there is a singular report of an oxygen insensitive nitrogenase system, isolated from a Streptomyces thermoautotrophicus bacterium found above burning charcoal fires in Germany. This superoxide dependent nitrogenase was only partially characterized and the strain is no longer available. The present project seeks to culture the original strain, as well as search for additional strains from similarly harsh environments that may harbor related nitrogenase systems. In particular, the project will target coal-seam fires and active volcanoes that have elevated levels of carbon monoxide; following the original isolation methods, strains will be cultivated under high temperatures with a carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide enriched atmosphere. Once identified, these strains will have their genome sequences determined and genes annotated. The soils from which they are isolated will also be sequenced to determine the aggregate meta-genome of all culturable and non-culturable microbes present in these harsh environments. The project will then seek to determine the biochemical and physiological properties of the nitrogenase systems in these organisms and attempt to transfer the oxygen-tolerant nitrogenase into other microbes for future biotechnology applications. The project has the potential to dramatically alter biological nitrogen fixation research and could ultimately lead to the engineering of plants that fix their own nitrogen. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to training through the involvement of three post-docs and one graduate student. Project outcomes and information will be disseminated through public lectures and through podcasts, both in the US (http://variationselectioninheritance.podbean.com/) and the UK (http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/imedia/itunes_collections/view/special-lectures).

While computing devices and the Internet have become essential for full participation in society, many of these technologies are not accessible for those who experience disability. Equal access to technology has been discussed as an issue in computing ethics, and many computing professionals report an ethical motivation for their decision to consider accessibility in their work. However, equal access is not typically addressed in ethics curricula for computing students. To address this gap, the PI and her team will provide evidence-based information as to the efficacy of various educational interventions for training future computing professionals about inclusive technology development. They also will provide the resources necessary to replicate these interventions at other universities. Students trained in the ethics of inclusive design will be motivated to meet global needs for inclusive technology. Such design has the potential to level the playing field for those who through age, accident, or medical circumstances experience disability. The materials to be made available through this project (including a video showcase of student projects, accessibility project ideas, and lecture slides) will provide faculty with the means to incorporate accessibility information into their computing curriculum. To ensure that these materials meet instructional needs, faculty at other universities will be surveyed to evaluate these resources. This work will be published in NSF-related ethics archive locations and on the team's website. Students with disabilities will be involved in the project as research assistants.<br/><br/>While prior educators have implemented specific interventions to train computing degree students about accessibility, there is a need for a systematic comparison of alternative interventions for accessibility education. The PI and her team will investigate the efficacy of multiple interventions for accessibility education on a scale and with a level of experimental rigor not previously attempted. While accessibility and inclusion are key for professionals, these concepts have thus far had limited coverage in ethics curricula in computing degree programs. In another innovative aspect, this work will examine the extent to which participation of people with disabilities contributes to the educational interventions. The three investigators have each been involved in accessibility research and education throughout their careers. This research will build on that experience in developing educational interventions (e.g., lectures on accessibility, assignments having hands-on experience with accessibility technology, team projects on a topic related to accessibility or inclusion, involvement by users with a disability as either an end-user, or as a project team member). Interventions will be implemented within undergraduate programs as part of required courses on human-computer interaction. The team will contrast views about the need for inclusive design between students in these programs with, as a control, students in other computing undergraduate programs at the same institution who are not exposed to the interventions. Students' ethical perceptions of their role in promoting accessibility will be measured in their final year of study. Measurements will include standardized questionnaires of attitudes toward people with disabilities, scenario-based evaluation of accessibility considerations in design, and qualitative analysis of written student work.","crimson"

The result is fragmented information that must be gathered and built into a coherent whole. In addition, these events may come in rapid succession. When the event rate is high and the number of fragments large, the problem comes to resemble that of assembling tens, hundreds or even thousands of puzzle pieces that are continually being dumped into a common container. Further, puzzle pieces can become damaged or lost, introducing errors into the puzzle assembly process. These challenges are well-studied in the field of computational (nanoscale) self-assembly, which models processes such as the growth of crystals from organic molecules in solution. This project adapts computational self-assembly models to create a new paradigm that treats pieces of information from multiple sensors like molecules randomly meeting and assembling in solution.

The collection's globally significant strengths are in aquatic insects, which are important bioindicators of the health of freshwater ecosystems, and black flies, which are significant vectors of human disease. As South Carolina's primary insect collection, this resource serves regional pest diagnostic needs, vouchers a wide variety of survey and monitoring projects, and underpins conservation planning for the region's arthropod diversity. With holdings of over one million specimens representing over 11,000 species, the collection is rich in historical biodiversity data. However, the collection's storage systems are aging, and many parts of the collection are in jeopardy of loss from museum pests and evaporation of preservative. This project will involve transfer of all specimens to modern cabinetry, drawers, and vials, ensuring its longevity, and will digitize locality and specimen images in the process. Several new positions will be created, including a collection manager, graduate assistant, and several part-time undergraduate assistants over the three years of the project. The improved collections and data captured will greatly expand the reach of our extension and outreach programs, improve regional pest monitoring efforts, and offer great opportunities for training of graduate and undergraduate students in entomology and biodiversity science.<br/><br/>Collection rehousing will follow renovation of two newly dedicated spaces adjacent to those currently occupied. Air-tight cabinetry will be employed throughout to eliminate dependence on fumigants for pest protection in the dry, pinned collection. In the alcohol-preserved collection, old vials with degraded stoppers will be replaced by secure screw-cap vials, and all vials will be moved into enclosed cabinetry to protect from light. As collection storage is upgraded, exemplars of each species in the collection will be imaged, and the associated data captured and transcribed with a combination of student and crowd-sourced assistance. Data will be ported to a relational, vouchered specimen database (Specify), and unique specimen identifiers will be applied to all specimens digitized. Data and images will be shared through the museum's web pages (https://sites.google.com/site/clemsonarthropodcollection/), as well as through such aggregators as iDigBio (http://www.idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Outreach activities will include biodiversity events at Clemson's main campus and satellite facilities, participation in citizen science data gathering efforts, and expansion of our program of in-house tours.","puce"

The result is fragmented information that must be gathered and built into a coherent whole. In addition, these events may come in rapid succession. When the event rate is high and the number of fragments large, the problem comes to resemble that of assembling tens, hundreds or even thousands of puzzle pieces that are continually being dumped into a common container. Further, puzzle pieces can become damaged or lost, introducing errors into the puzzle assembly process. These challenges are well-studied in the field of computational (nanoscale) self-assembly, which models processes such as the growth of crystals from organic molecules in solution. This project adapts computational self-assembly models to create a new paradigm that treats pieces of information from multiple sensors like molecules randomly meeting and assembling in solution.

The 2010-2011 Canterbury, New Zealand Earthquake Sequence included four major earthquakes that produced high levels of ground shaking in the Christchurch metropolitan region. These earthquakes triggered thousands of rockfalls, which impacted several hundred buildings and resulted in both human and capital losses. However, the impact of these rockfalls on structures varied widely. In some instances boulders became enmeshed within a building's structural system, causing damage but preserving life-safety. In other situations boulders fully penetrated building systems and caused structural collapse. While a rockfall's interaction with a building system may be conceptually understood to be a function of both impact energy and structural capacity, it still remains unclear exactly how these factors govern a building's resistance to these impacts. There is virtually no information on this in the engineering literature. This work will be the first extensive, well-documented study of the subject and will be of immediate use to engineers in all parts of the world where rockfalls are a potential threat. <br/><br/>To this end, this research seeks to acquire, process, and archive data pertaining to the impact of rockfalls on a series of common residential and commercial structures. This study will be accomplished through geo-referenced, 3D, ground-based LIDAR scans and Structure from Motion (SfM) photographic acquisition at approximately 30 damaged buildings. In addition to documentation at high detail, the resulting database will provide a substantial increase in the number of high-quality case histories of rockfall-structure interaction. This work additionally aims to identify the factors that govern the resilience of a wide range of common structures through a preliminary series of coupled runout/structural impact model simulations of the rockfall process. The project includes a range of broader impacts including most notably development of preliminary guidelines on building system resilience to rockfalls. These guidelines will have important implications for building codes worldwide and more immediately will serve to inform local rebuilding and recovery efforts in Christchurch. The work will be done in close cooperation with researchers from GNS Science, New Zealand.","navy_blue"

This project seeks to answer this question through a historical study of the University of California's Natural Reserve System (NRS)the largest and most diverse network of biological field stations administered by any academic institution in the world.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>In the United States, historians of science have long focused on laboratories as spaces for the production of knowledge, while environmental historians have concentrated on federal agencies and public lands. Research on biological field stations administered by academic institutions and non-governmental organizations has remained more limited in scope, and most has examined the period from 1890 to 1940. This project proposes that, despite this lack of scholarly attention, biological field stations have played crucial roles in American environmental science and politics. They have provided spaces for large-scale, comparative, and place-based research, facilitated collaborations of academic scientists with government officials, trained large numbers of researchers, and compiled long-term data sets that have shaped our understanding environmental change. Today, more than 330 such stations exist around the world, 286 of which are located in the United States. Biological field stations constitute the missing masses present but unaccounted for in American environmental history. This project will explore this crucial but untold story, and show how biological field stations can contribute even further to a more sustainable society.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include three categories of activities. The project will contribute to the development of a new archive that will preserve NRS historical materials for future generations of scientists and historians. It will contribute to a K-12 science education program designed to reach underrepresented student communities in local schools. And it will include a broader outreach effort of public lectures and Web-based content that will disseminate the project's approach and results with the goal of making the social sciences and humanities more active participants in collaborative research at biological field stations throughout the world.","crimson"

Although oat has this important health benefit, the understanding of how oat fiber develops is lacking. Genomic resources for oats have significantly lagged behind that for other grains. The fact that oat has a very large and complex polyploid genome compared to other crop plants has contributed to the challenges in identifying the gene networks that control fiber development and other economically important processes and pathways in oats. The goal of this project is to generate a draft genome sequence of cultivated oats by sequencing related wild oat genomes that are smaller in size to that of cultivated oats to assist in sequence assembly and annotation. <br/><br/>This project will utilize high throughput sequencing strategies, optical mapping and diploid genetic resources to facilitate the assembly and annotation of a functional hexaploid oat (Avena sativa) genome sequence. The specific objectives include: 1) finishing the sequencing of the A. ventricosa diploid CC-genome as well as creating an A. eriantha diploid CC-genome assembly; 2) generating physical optical maps for six hexaploid Avena genomes, two CC-diploid genomes, two AA-diploid genomes and a putative diploid DD-genome by using cutting edge BioNano optical mapping technology; 3) increasing GBS marker density across parental lines of a selected linkage mapping population to provide additional anchor points for assembled contigs that will be combined with short-read (HiSeq) and long-read (PacBio) sequencing to assemble and anchor the hexaploid oat genome (AADDCC); and, 4) annotating the sequenced genomes by generating RNA-seq data for each species in conjunction with ab initio prediction methods. Importantly, annotations will be evaluated and manually curated through user-contributed annotation as part of the Plant Pathway Elucidation Project (P2EP; http://p2ep.org) which is a collaborative effort between academia and industry established at the North Carolina Research Campus. The goal of this program is to tie together educational opportunity, scientific discovery and the development of a knowledge base to ""advance scientific research, create opportunities for industry and consumers, and enhance human health"". Students and postdoctoral fellows associated with this project will participate in the P2EP summer sessions. All data generated in this project will be disseminated widely through the P2EP website, OatGlobal (http://oatglobal.org) and Gramene (http://gramene.org). All sequence information will be accessible through the GenBank Short Read Archive (SRA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

It marks the end of the global warm conditions of the early Paleozoic that lasted ~150my and occurred under elevated pCO2 conditions. Considerable doubt has recently been raised with regard to the duration of the LOG, its potential driving mechanisms, and pre-glacial, long-term temperature variations. For instance approximately 15 Ma prior to LOG the North American continental plate was situated in tropical to subtropical latitudes, but sedimentological and paleontological evidence suggest a shift from deposition of warm water carbonates to deposition of cool water carbonates. It is not clear whether this sedimentological change reflects global cooling (indicating significant perturbation to the global climate system well before the Late Ordovician glaciation) or physical responses to tectonic activity with no requisite climatic implications. <br/>The projects will test competing hypotheses that try to explain this event through an extensive geochemical study. In particular, PIs will use the geochemical archive of conodont apatite (delta18O and epsilonNd) and carbonates (DELTA48, delta18O, and delta13C) to address questions about paleoceanographic conditions during the Early Late Ordovician. They expect that this research will lead 1) to clarification of potential causes for the paleontological/sedimentological changes during this interval, 2) to a better understanding of epicontinental sea circulation and an improved facies model for epicontinental low latitude carbonate platforms (for which no modern-day analogues exist), and 3) to better documentation of the temperature history of the Ordovician greenhouse interval.<br/>This research project will have active participation by undergraduate students, graduate students, and a secondary school science teacher. Therefore, the project will not only impact present university students and researchers, it will also impact future generations of students through enhancing an earth science secondary educations teacherï¿½ï¿½s knowledge base and science curriculum. Data will be contributed to publicly accessible databases making them available for further research and general education in the fields of paleoclimate and paleoceanography.","hot_pink"

Despite their importance to climate, direct measurements of these gases in the atmosphere are limited to the last 50 years at best. Air trapped in ice cores extends those data back hundreds of millennia, and measurements of greenhouse gases in ice cores underpin much of our understanding of global chemical cycles relevant to modern climate change. Existing records vary in quality and detail. The proposed work fills gaps in our knowledge of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide over the last 10,000 years. New measurements from an ice core from the South Pole will be used to determine what role changes in ocean and land based processes played in controlling these gases, which decreased during the first 2,000 years of this time period, then gradually increased toward the present. The work will address a major controversy over whether early human activities could have impacted the atmosphere, and provide data to improve mathematical models of the land-ocean-atmosphere system that predict how future climate change will impact the composition of the atmosphere and climate. <br/><br/>For nitrous oxide the work will improve on existing concentration records and provide a novel, detailed Holocene stable isotope record. It will also develop measurement of the isotopomers of nitrous oxide and explore their utility for understanding aspects of the Holocene nitrous oxide budget. The primary goal is to determine if marine and/or terrestrial emissions of nitrous oxide change in response to changes in Holocene climate. A new Holocene isotopic record for carbon dioxide (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes), will improve the precision of existing records by a factor 5 and increase the temporal resolution. These data will be used to evaluate controversial hypotheses about why carbon dioxide concentrations changed in the Holocene and provide insight into millennial scale processes in the carbon cycle, which are not resolved by current isotopic data. A graduate student will receive advanced training during and the student and principle investigator will conduct outreach efforts targeted at local middle school students. The proposed work will also contribute to teaching efforts by the PI and to public lectures on climate and climate change. The results will be disseminated through publications, data archive, and the OSU Ice Core Lab web site. New analytical methods of wide utility will also be developed and documented.","plum"

Many developmental decisions are made within the first hours of emergence of the seedling from the ground. These decisions are in direct response to the seedling's environment, particularly with respect to the available light. Both light quantity and quality are sensed using elaborate light receptor mechanisms, which translate the obtained information into various growth responses. One of these light receptors is called phytochrome, which consists of a light-sensing molecule called the chromophore and an attached protein called the apoprotein. A small family of genes encodes multiple types of phytochrome apoproteins that can bind to additional identical or very similar molecules. These protein complexes can bind to DNA and direct the transcription of genes, thus ultimately allowing for a multitude of physiological responses in the plant. This project will use a genome wide approach to directly compare transcriptional and proteomic changes in tomato seedlings and several phytochrome mutants during early development. It is expected that this project will reveal novel functions of the lesser-studied phytochrome genes, and identify new interactions of light-response genes, both on the transcript and the protein level during early seedling responses to light.<br/><br/>Tomato is both a major agronomic crop and a model organism for the study of fleshy fruits. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of light-mediated responses during seedling establishment may in the future improve breeding or engineering of plants with enhanced structural integrity, optimized architecture, earlier (or later) flowering, and increased yield. Work on this project will be conducted primarily by undergraduates, and explicitly include students currently underrepresented in the sciences through a collaboration with Heritage University, a minority serving institution in central Washington.

The integration of these data, including fossil species, permits the reconstruction of the Tree of Life, which has been identified by Science magazine as one of the 125 top scientific challenges of the new millennium. By documenting phenotypes for tree-building, researchers test major evolutionary hypotheses such as when did a species develop flowers? Or the ability to fly? With tens of millions of species on the planet, organizing this informatino requires substantial creative computer infrastructure. Such infrastructure has existed for genotypic information for some time, initiated in large part by the Human Genome Project in the 20th century. Organizational tools and databases for phenotypes has not, however, received similar attention historically. Thus in 2001, with support from the National Science Foundation, investigators initiated MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org/), an open-source Web application and database that has become a modern tool for collecting, organizing, storing and presenting data on phenotypes across the Tree of Life. Because software must continuously change to function in the ever-evolving world of the Internet, this project is to sustain MorphoBank software and infrastructure such that the tool and database endures as a robust resource for the evolutionary biology community and the public.<br/><br/>MorphoBank gives scientists a unique digital workspace to collaborate - in real time - with others worldwide and to conduct data collection relevant to the Tree of Life and evolution. Prior success of MorphoBank is underscored by key statistics. Each month scientists record >90,000 observations and load >2,000 newly-generated, curated and annotated images. Over 2,000 visitors reach the site monthly to view projects >3,000 times, matrices >6,000 times, and media >75,000 times. 30% of published projects on MorphoBank are derived from separate NSF-funded geology, biology and anthropology grants. Another >35% of projects hold the research output funded by scientific agencies internationally making MorphoBank a global destination as a tool and archive. Scholarship that would have been impossible before MorphoBank includes the NSF-supported Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) project for mammals. This research was published in Science and included >12,000 images tied to hundreds of thousands of scientific observations by a team of over 20 researchers. The paper received wide press (New York Times, BBC, Time Magazine), including mention of MorphoBank as the research-enabling innovation. Morphobank represents a new element in the US scientific infrastructure, providing a model platform for location-independent global scientific collaboration. Proposed contributions to education and training provided by the current project include: (1) a software course in Web-based bioinformatics for ethnic minority computer science majors from Stony Brook University, New York, (2) two summer internships for selected students from that course, and (3) two ""Morpholution"" courses at the American Museum of Natural History for high school students to learn scientific practices for studying phenotypes.","puce"

Paleoclimate records show significant fluctuations in dust associated with changes in climate. However, the role of dust as a feedback to climate change in the past and into the future remains highly uncertain. The proposed working hypothesis is that a positive feedback between dust, radiation, precipitation and temperature is an important driver for abrupt climate change. Researchers from the University of Miami will focus on two periods of abrupt climate change in the Atlantic: Heinrich Event 1 and the termination of the African Humid Period. These are two periods of abrupt climate change for which the source of the abruptness is still a matter of debate. PIs will run transient paleoclimate simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) coupled to an interactive dust model, synthesize paleo-dust and drought records, and test the sensitivity of their results to changes in dust optical properties. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>The proposed research will advance our understanding and knowledge of forcing and feedbacks associated with desert dust in past periods of abrupt climate change, and determine if climate change is more abrupt when dust is an interactive component.

Results from the transient paleoclimate simulations will be made available online to facilitate paleoclimate model-data intercomparisons. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The project will establish linkages between the University of Miami, NCAR, and Cornell University through the use of CESM and the participation in the CESM Paleoclimate Working Group.

The ability of crop plants to fight off diseases is therefore a very important agricultural trait. Farmers can avoid some diseases with pesticides, or breeders can develop crop varieties that resist diseases. Crops have the ability to fight off diseases by reacting to the disease-causing microorganism with defensive mechanisms, known as the plant hypersensitive response (HR). This refers to a process whereby an infected cell dies before the infection can spread to other cells in the plant. Despite its importance to maintain healthy crops, much remains unknown about the HR. In this work, a multi-disciplinary approach involving a number of field and lab-based techniques will be used to gain a better understanding of the HR in corn, the most economically valuable crop in the US. The genes and processes involved in controlling the HR will be identified and characterized. While this work will be performed primarily in corn, it is likely that many features of the HR are shared among different crops. As such this work will provide fundamental insights into one of the most important ways plants defend themselves against diseases, and the knowledge will be useful to develop improved crop plants by making them more resistant to diseases. Outreach activities with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will focus on educational activities on genetics, plant breeding, biotechnology and associated societal implications and will build on an existing collaboration with the museum that has developed several instructional modules for middle, high school, home school and mature students and their teachers. These continuing programs will be supported and several new programs will be developed around DNA sequence analysis, biotechnology and society.<br/><br/>In previous work, a novel genetic screen was used to identify loci, genes and pathways associated with natural genetic variation that controlled HR. In this project, a multi-disciplinary approach involving mutagenesis, field genetics, high-throughput genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, metabolomics, bioinformatics, microscopy and molecular biology will be used to gain an understanding of the HR from molecular genetic, transcriptional, biochemical and histological perspectives. Genes and pathways controlling the HR response will be identified and characterized. The HR will be observed at cellular, transcriptional and metabolic levels. The utility of a novel and potentially widely-applicable approach for the identification and characterization of mutations conferring quantitative phenotypes will be demonstrated. Public access to sequencing data generated this project will be made possible through deposition at the Short Read Archive (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). Information on the position of genes controlling the HR at the transcriptional level (expression Quantitative Trait Loci ? eQTL) will be made available at MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org).

This study will extend this work using output from reanalyses, model simulations from the CMIP5 archive, and experimental CESM model runs to investigate how and why the ongoing loss of arctic sea ice and high-latitude terrestrial snow cover may cause mid-latitude weather patterns to change. Past and projected patterns in 500 hPa heights will be analyzed using a combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) ? a neural-network-based technique that reduces large data sets to their representative patterns ? a new meridional circulation index, and an extreme weather index to address the hypothesis that Arctic Amplification of past and future global climate change promotes circulation patterns that favor extreme weather events in middle latitudes of the northern hemisphere. The PIs suggest that changes in the energy budget of the arctic surface, because of sea-ice loss and earlier snow melt on high-latitude land, reduce meridional thickness gradients, which induce generally weaker zonal flow aloft and higher amplitude circulation features. They think these upper-level flow patterns slow the eastward progression of large-scale atmospheric Rossby waves, favoring more persistent weather conditions that increase the probability of extreme weather such as cold-air outbreaks, heat waves, droughts, and heavy precipitation. They believe the primary physical mechanism driving the change is an enhanced and seasonally varying arctic heating: in fall/winter it is ocean-based associated with substantial sea ice loss, while in warmer months it is land-based due primarily to earlier snow melt and reduced soil moisture. Higher-amplitude flow trajectories may also exacerbate sea-ice and snow-cover loss, thereby constituting a positive feedback loop.<br/><br/>Because extreme weather events, such as temperature and precipitation extremes, are often caused by high-amplitude, slow-moving upper-level circulation patterns, this analysis will focus on detecting and characterizing these patterns, interpreting the weather conditions associated with them, and identifying regions that are likely to be affected. This study attempts to connect arctic change with the rest of the global climate system.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Changes in extreme weather as a result of greenhouse gas accumulation will directly and dramatically affect millions of people across the globe, thus a better understanding and more accurate future projection of changes in the frequency, location, and severity of droughts, floods, and temperature extremes are urgently needed by decision-makers at all levels of society. Preliminary work has already attracted world-wide attention via articles in prominent newspapers, radio interviews, interviews for the Weather Channel, magazine articles, and numerous online blogs. This will also be an opportunity for a new post-doc. The PIs will prepare a module for the NSF-supported ?Beyond Penguins and Polar Bears? project for K-5 teachers. Both PIs make frequent public and school presentations on climate-change related issues, and because extreme weather is so relevant to society at large, results from the proposed study will figure prominently into these presentations.","plum"

Writing is one of the most important inventions in human history. It not only enables communication at much larger social scales than speech or sign-language, but it also facilitates the spread of complex messages among individuals separated in space and time. Writing also expands human memory, allowing for the accumulation and transmission of large amounts of cultural knowledge across many generations. These capabilities make writing one of the few truly transformative innovations in human history. Despite the significance of this technology, the development of writing and its impact on broader societal affairs remains poorly understood. This project will be undertaken by an interdisciplinary team from linguistics, art history, archaeology, and evolutionary anthropology. They will examine the role of linguistic and social factors in the development of Classic Maya writing (from roughly 250 to 900 AD), one of the best examples of a deciphered ancient script. They will address a set of fundamental questions related to key dimensions of ancient scripts: (1) the relationships between language evolution and the development of written communication systems, (2) the technological production of texts and the organization of scribal communities, and (3) the social and historical contexts of ancient writing traditions. Within each of these topics, they will evaluate a set of competing hypotheses by applying new analytical techniques from the social sciences and evolutionary biology to the Maya Hieroglyphic Database, a unique and comprehensive record of Classic Maya writing.<br/><br/>The project will produce important new insights into the relationships between cultural and linguistic diversity, population dynamics, and the development of complex human communication networks. The findings of this project will significantly refine basic understanding of the evolution of Classic Maya writing in terms of how the production and dissemination of texts and images influenced societal change. The project also will demonstrate the value of a powerful set of analytical techniques for studying the evolution of cultural traditions. A significant outcome of this project is a comprehensive digital record of Maya hieroglyphic texts, which will be made widely accessible on the Internet. This digital archive will appeal to the general public and to a broader scientific community, including native Maya speakers and indigenous scholars. New international partnerships among universities and disciplines will promote teaching, training, and collaboration among social scientists. The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students from multiple disciplines in collaborative research and in the conduct of new analytical techniques. Project findings and the data produced by the project will enhance general capabilities to understand the impact of linguistic, cultural, and historical factors on the development of human communication systems, topic with considerable societal relevance.

Recently, new gateways for understanding social evolution have opened up due to advances in genomics, allowing unprecedented opportunities to study social behavior on a molecular level. By identifying which genes vary in their expression according to social roles, and how those genes have evolved across a range of social behavior, this project will shed light on the relative importance of particular genes in driving social evolution. Thus, it provides what previous studies lack. Specifically, it can clarify what types of genomic changes are important at each stage of social evolution. This step-wise approach to understanding social evolution provides major advantages over previous work, capitalizing on a unique group of carpenter bees where sociality varies from solitary to simple to complex social species. This study will incorporate students in research positions and integrate data sets into new courses. It will involve outreach activities for long-term pollinator biodiversity monitoring, including field surveys of native bees and citizen-science initiatives. A web-based interface is currently being developed to educate the public on native bees. This website will provide an interactive education tool on native pollinators to highlight their importance for agricultural, garden, and park sustainability.<br/><br/>For the first time, genomic tools can be used to test alternative hypotheses about the genomic basis of behavior, utilizing bee species with both simple and complex social behavior. This will be the first study to determine the types of genomic changes associated with the earliest origins of simple sociality and its subsequent elaboration into complex sociality. It utilizes a unique clade of carpenter bees where social behavior ranges enormously, from solitary to complex with many intermediate and very weakly social species. Transcriptomic assays and genome sequence comparisons will be assessed within a phylogenetic context to determine whether transitions from simple forms of cooperation to more complex societies are associated with differential expression of key genes, changes in the structure of those genes, or both. The project involves the following three key components: 1) Development of bee genome databases, where the genomes of six species will be assembled and annotated in order to provide basic information on the gene complement and functional categories of taxonomically restricted genes and to understand gene family expansion/contraction in each species. 2) Comparisons of gene expression, which will use transcriptomic comparisons across species to understand which elements of solitary behavior (foraging, reproduction) are associated with the origin and maintenance of sociality. 3) Adaptive evolution in genes and regulatory elements across the genome, which will involve sequence comparisons of genes and cis-regulatory elements across focal species to determine whether social transitions have involved adaptive changes in DNA sequences in addition to differential gene expression. The proposed project moves beyond all previous genomic studies of ants, honey bees, and social wasps by being able to capture the genetic events associated with changes at the dawn of sociality. Data will be deposited on the NCBI whole genome shotgun (WGS), functional genomic (GEO) and short read archive (SRA), and information will be provided in accordance with NCBI standards. All data will be released to NCBI upon submission for publication.","teal"

The proposed research activities include simulating the surface segregation process in some selected binary and ternary magnetic alloy nanostructures, analyzing the variation of atomic ordering as a function of the size, shape, composition, and processing conditions of the alloy nanostructures, predicting the magnetic properties of the alloy nanostructures with their thermodynamically equilibrated structures, and elaborating the interweaved relation among surface segregation, atomic ordering, and magnetic property of the alloy nanostructures using computational techniques. Atomistic Monte Carlo simulations will be performed to acquire the thermodynamically equilibrated configurations of the alloy nanostructures and the first-principles density functional theory calculations will be used to predict the magnetic properties of the alloy nanostructures. This work will provide knowledge for performance optimization of magnetic alloy nanostructures through tuning their composition, structure, and processing conditions. Therefore, the proposed research will strengthen our capability and enrich our knowledge in developing well-controlled magnetic metal alloy nanostructures for advancing ultra-high density recording technique.","goldenrod"

The cuticle is a waxy, water-proof layer on the outer surfaces of plant leaves and stems that plays a vital role in preventing water loss. It is also where plants first interact with most insects and diseases. Therefore, the cuticle is important to keep plants healthy while preventing them from drying out in the breeze. While many prior projects have contributed insights into cuticle composition, development and function, very few have focused on the adult leaves of cereal crops, whose cuticle has a significant impact on the agricultural performance of these key crops. This project will discover genes that control cuticle development and function in corn, evaluate the potential for improvement of the leaf cuticle to help produce crops with increased drought tolerance and resistance to diseases, and generate tools to guide these efforts.<br/><br/>Prior studies have laid a foundation for understanding cuticle biogenesis and function in plants, but very few have focused on adult leaves of economically important cereal crops such as maize, and none have yet been translated to crop improvements. This project will analyze the biogenesis of adult maize leaf cuticle and its genetic basis, and will elucidate the impact of genetically determined cuticle variation on drought tolerance and pathogen penetration. The first aim is to relate genome-wide analysis of epidermal gene expression to changes in cuticle structure, composition, and function across a developmental timecourse. The second aim is to identify loci controlling cuticular evaporation (CE) rate in adult leaves via a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The third aim is to analyze maize lines selected for diversity in cuticle function to elucidate relationships between cuticle characteristics (histology, ultrastructure and composition), cuticle function as a barrier against water loss and pathogen penetration, and drought tolerance. The fourth aim is to elucidate, via network analysis, the relationships between gene expression, cuticle composition, and cuticle function. This final aim is expected to identify key genetic regulators and a systems-level understanding of the genetic basis for cuticle biogenesis and function in adult maize leaves. Project outcomes will include new insights regarding adult maize leaf cuticle development and its genetic regulation, new knowledge of the impact of cuticle modification on drought tolerance and pathogen infection in maize, and genetic tools to guide such modifications. Project outcomes and data will be communicated through multiple open access publications, a project website housed at http://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/smith/, and deposition of data to three long-term repositories: the NCBI Short Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), Maize GDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/), and an interactive database to be hosted by the UCSD library (http://library.ucsd.edu/dc). Participation in this project will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities preparing young scientists at various stages of their education to enter the science workforce of the future. It will also broaden participation in science by involving approximately 120 undergraduates at all institutions combined, with a focus on students with minimal prior access to research opportunities and/or awareness of science career opportunities.","teal"

The aim of this project is to bridge the gaps that separate scientific communities studying the complex atmospheres of Earth, other solar system planets, and planets around other stars (""exoplanets""). These different systems are united by the same physics and chemistry used by geo-scientists at Earth and by astronomers investigating other planets in our solar system and throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Common themes need common approaches, and results at one location can validate less certain findings elsewhere. This program will create pathways of communication that utilize resources more effectively, promote common modes of data analysis, create all-purpose ionospheric models, and foster student training that removes discipline barriers. The impact of ionospheric disturbances due to Space Weather experienced at Earth (e.g., GPS degradations) will enable parallel studies for Mars, where multiple satellites need reliable communication and navigation for land-based rovers and, ultimately, human exploration. <br/><br/>While the Sun's ultraviolet and x-ray light is the same for all of our planets, the gases present at each location are different, and this leads to a vast set of ions and electrons that comprise the ionosphere at each planet in our Solar System. Even more compartmentalized are studies of ionospheres at planets around other stars. The scientific communities that study them (geophysicists and astronomers) are isolated from each other - programmatically at funding agencies and at professional meetings and societies. This lack of cross-fertilization impedes progress. This award focuses upon the treatment of fundamental atmospheric and space plasma processes as universal - rather than as unique, planet-by-planet, phenomena. The team will develop the first comprehensive archive to host all of the parameters necessary to conduct comparative studies of ionospheres throughout the solar system and beyond, and provide a versatile user-friendly model to do so. The research tools developed will offer many opportunities to resolve important issues in one discipline by applying knowledge and expertise found in other disciplines.","lime"

The generally irreversible deformation of metallic materials at the macroscopic scale called plastic deformation arises due to the motion of vast numbers of defects in their underlying regular crystalline structure under applied loading. Such defect motions lead to special spatial patterns of organization of multiple defects called microstructure, and it is known that this defect microstructure has significant effect on the material's macroscopic properties like strength and ductility. The individual defect motions occur at much smaller length scales and much faster time scales than those of macroscopically observed plastic deformation, thus requiring a mathematical process of averaging to define the macroscopic model of collective behavior of defects from the microscopic dynamics. This award supports the development and validation of such a macroscopic model from microscopic fundamentals through multiscale mathematical and computational modeling. The project addresses a key scientific question with significant impact on society. A great deal of modern manufacturing, design of light-weight, high-strength structural materials and materials for gas turbines for energy and aerospace applications all depend upon understanding of microstructure evolution and its effect on material properties. Widely used industrial design codes do not at present make use of microstructure sensitive material models. This research will develop a truly material microstructure-sensitive model for plastic strength and dislocation microstructure evolution that has the potential to revolutionize the way metallic materials are designed in many industries, bringing about significant cost and energy savings for the US economy. The research tightly integrates the fields of Applied Mathematics, Mechanics of Materials, and Materials Science, and this will lead to fruitful interdisciplinary interplay of ideas between these fields, all directed to very practical outcomes, including the training of students which will enhance the US workforce in science and technology. Efforts will be made to archive developed computer codes at the NSF supported Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center to enable systematic, free, widespread access to interested practitioners.<br/><br/>The challenge of this work is to develop a novel computational tool for accurate multi-scale simulations of plasticity and dislocation microstructure evolution in crystalline materials. The tasks addressed will be the computation of plastic strength and associated microstructure of a material at the meso and macroscale directly from the underlying motion of crystal defects. This application is a paradigmatic complex system, with immense practical relevance. Specifically, an exact, but non-closed, partial differential equation based theory representing the evolution of space-time averaged dislocation dynamics will be utilized, that contains well-defined place-holders for microscopic dislocation dynamics based input. These inputs, typically prescribed as phenomenological constitutive assumptions, will be replaced in this work by a carefully designed coupling, on the ""slow"" time-scale of meso-macro response, with time-averaged response of ""fast"", local (on the macroscopic scale) Discrete Dislocation Dynamics simulations. The overall strategy is based on novel and sound continuum mechanical principles like a conservation statement for topological charge carried by crystal defects coupled to macroscopic elasticity as well as modern mathematical tools like Young Measure theory for averaging multi-time scale response of nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations. Interestingly, this approach for solving a patently practical problem involves finite dimensional dynamical system input into an overarching infinite dimensional dynamical system.","navy_blue"

So far, the largest event in the sequence is the April 1, 2014 magnitude 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake. The ground deformation caused by this large earthquake will persist long after the earthquake and decay over a period of years. Measurements of the surface deformation during and after the event can provide important information about the properties of the Earth in the region, improve understanding of deformation processes, and aid in determining regions with a high likelihood of producing large aftershocks. Large dense GPS networks installed by U.S., German, French, Peruvian, and Chilean groups in Chile will record this deformation close to the earthquake epicenter but significant deformation is expected farther away in northwest Argentina. This rapid response project will install new GPS networks and collect data from existing GPS stations in the Argentine Puna Plateau to fully capture the ground motion associated with this event. These data will contribute to understanding the physics and hazard potential of large megathrust earthquakes in Chile and elsewhere, such as Cascadia, Alaska, and Japan.<br/><br/>The April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake was the largest event in an unusual sequence of earthquakes, which began in the northern Chile subduction zone on March 16, 2014. Based on the USGS preliminary teleseismic and surface wave inversion, slip occurred along a 250 km along-strike and about 150 km down-dip section of the Chile megathrust that last failed in an M 8.8 earthquake in 1877. U.S., Chilean, Peruvian, German, and the French groups have built relatively dense continuously operating GPS (CGPS) and survey mode GPS (SGPS) station networks in this region, thus the near-field inter-, co- and post-seismic transient signals will be well observed in northern Chile. However, there will be significant co-seismic and post-seismic transient motion up to 700 km from the main event, incorporating nearly all of the Altiplano and at least much of eastern Cordillera in Bolivia, and the Puna of northwestern Argentina. Measuring the mid- and far-field co- and post-seismic signals in the Altiplano and beyond will be critical to any geodynamic modeling effort. In rapid response to the April 1, 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua, Chile earthquake, this project will install 4 new CGPS stations and retrieve data from 10 CGPS stations in the Argentine Puna Plateau. Data will be made immediately available to the international earth science community through the UNAVCO Facility Archive. These geodetic data could be important in determining regions with a high likelihood of producing large aftershocks and for hazard mitigation efforts because the largest aftershock (M 7.7 on April 3) was larger than expected, potentially indicating continued unusual activity with the neighboring segments thought to retain a large slip deficit.","hot_pink"

Southeast Asia, in particular, is susceptible to frequent typhoons and severe damage, and rapidly expanding populations tend to settle on the coasts where there is concentrated economic activity, exacerbating the negative consequences of coastal hazards. The objective of this research is to analyze sediment deposits left by the storm surge associated with Typhoon Ketsana on the Vietnam coast near Da Nang in 2009. Microfossil data will be combined with physical sedimentological data to characterize the impacts of the tropical cyclone on Vietnam. This project will improve understanding of tropical cyclone inundation characteristics and impacts and contribute to more accurate risk assessment and coastal hazard planning for dense populations in coastal communities. Research will be conducted at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and will be supervised by Assistant Professor Adam Switzer, who is an internationally recognized expert in tsunami and storm deposits. The Earth Observatory of Singapore is in an ideal location to study tropical cyclone events with state of the art facilities necessary to complete this research. <br/><br/>Coastal sediments archive geologic evidence of tropical cyclones and these sedimentary deposits improve our understanding of landfalling storm processes. The documentation of the geological evidence of this catastrophic marine inundation will contribute to a better understanding of tropical cyclones and their associated processes. Microfossil (foraminifera) composition of the deposits and physical sedimentological data will be compared with samples collected from the beach face and offshore. A combination of foraminiferal taxonomy and taphonomy data for the samples collected will assist in the analysis of the marine inundation event of Typhoon Ketsana. The coastal stratigraphic record in Vietnam can be compared with other depositional records from tropical cyclones to help calibrate the characteristics of past storm events in sediment records.

Until recently, dictionaries were compiled and organized by hand, entered into some kind of typesetting system, and finally rendered in print form for use by scholars and language learners. Contemporary dictionaries are now compiled and organized electronically so that the information they contain can be used not only to produce stand-alone print artifacts, but also be integrated with the other components to ensure greater accuracy of the documentation as a whole, enable updates to be produced at regular intervals, and support the development of natural-language processing tools for the languages that are documented in this way. The goal of this exploratory project is to develop methods for machines to understand the implicit structure of the hundreds of extant print dictionaries of endangered and other low-resource languages as a critical first step in enabling their documentation to be of maximal usefulness to future generations.<br/><br/><br/>Print dictionaries use ordering, typeface and other formatting conventions to indicate the intended structure of dictionary entries. The first task of this project is to use optical character reading (OCR) software to convert those entries to machine-interpretable form so as to preserve the original formatting. The second is to develop software to convert the corrected OCR output into structured, machine-interpretable archive-standard formats. Because print formats vary widely across dictionaries, human intervention is required to inform the software about how to translate the implicit representations for a particular dictionary's entries into explicit ones. But such manual annotation is only required for a small part of the dictionary, as the formatting conventions are consistent across all of its entries, and once learned can be used to identify and correct errors and inconsistencies, and enable automated editing tasks like updating orthographies. The tool will be developed, tested and evaluated using print dictionaries of two indigenous languages of Latin America that were produced in the latter part of the twentieth century.

The focus is on what makes people successful rather than what makes them fail. It was developed through a partnership between the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES), the Office for Community Health (OCH) at the University of New Mexico (UNM), and Northwestern University. The project is also interdisciplinary, partnering researchers from Anthropology, Psychology and Economics/Public Health with AISES to contribute a unique perspective on Native participation in STEM. The aim of this research is to identify the role of culture, individual identity, epistemology and bi-cultural efficacy in this process. The guiding hypothesis is that AI-AN success in STEM is influenced by dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity, with the role of bi-cultural efficacy being particularly significant. The researchers are interested in knowing: (a) What factors positively influence AI-AN success in STEM?; (b) What role do the dynamics of culture, epistemology and individual identity play in AI-AN success in STEM and how are these dynamics played-out in individual experience?; and (c) Does bi-cultural efficacy play a role in this process, and if so, what is that role?<br/><br/> The proposed collaboration uses a mixed methods design, beginning with an ethnographic approach that will build on advances in knowledge from the extensive literature on deficits and barriers, and nascent research on epistemology, adding new empirical data. The research consciously privileges voices of Native scholars whose experience is not well represented in mainstream perspectives or taken into consideration by policy makers. Adaptive project design through iterative data collection and analysis with synthesis and incorporation of findings from different components ongoing throughout the study will allow for dynamic inclusion of participant input. The study includes four separate but integrated research components: (1) 75 in-depth ethnographic interviews with 25 AI-AN STEM professionals and AISES members, conducted in three iterative sets of 25 each; (2) Three AI-AN undergraduate Student Research Scientists (SRS) from UNM will be mentored in the conduct of 36 peer interviews (12 each) with other AI-AN students; (3) Secondary analysis of unique AISES organizational archive with 35 years of information on more than 6000+ AI-AN involved in STEM; and (4) a preliminary survey will be conducted in year three of the project with 25 AISES members to validate measures of bi-cultural efficacy that contribute to AI-AN success in STEM. The Principal Investigators will mentor Native scholars to develop protocols, collect and analyze data, present findings, and participate as members of the Research Team. A Project Summit in Year Three will disseminate project findings to a broad group of AISES stakeholders. This project will also structure a new role for AISES to play in the STEM community by leveraging the unique position of AISES as a national AI-AN STEM organization and developing data collection protocols and data collection tools the organization can continue to use for research in the future. <br/><br/> Results of this research will increase understanding of how AI-AN individuals leverage personal and cultural assets in a way that embraces a congruency between Indigenous culture (Native science) and Western science as they achieve success in STEM. This information will contribute to the literature analyzing issues in AI-AN education and under-representation in STEM and indicate directions for future research. Most importantly, this research may lay the foundation for increasing the proportion of AI-AN scientists. Factors that contribute to success and achievement of AI-AN in STEM are often unrecognized, underappreciated or poorly understood. The improved coherence of interventions that will result from better conceptualization of the strengths and needs of AI-AN students will provide a roadmap for developing best-practice and model-driven programming within universities, improve AI-AN educational outcomes in STEM, and in turn, contribute to improvements in AI-AN individual and community well-being.","azure"

Env-DATA links movement tracks with environmental data from different remote-sensing and global reanalysis data providers, including NASA, NOAA, and ECMWF. Env-DATA interprets environmental variables in the correct encryption, grid, and projection systems and interpolates the data in space and time to the observed animal track locations, or a collection of comparison points or grid. Funding through this proposal will allow support of continuous on-going operations of Env-DATA, which requires regular quality control tests to detect cases where the data providers to Env-DATA may have changed the metadata, location, or access protocol.

In particular, the role of the tropics in climate shifts remains poorly understood. This grant will provide funding to the University of Minnesota at two campuses: Duluth and Twin Cities, in order to recover a drill core from Lake Chalco, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City. These lake sediments have the potential to provide a half-million year record of North American climate. The core from Lake Chalco is directly relevant to one of the most densely populated urban centers on our planet, Mexico City, home to ~20 million people. The project includes plans to increase public scientific literacy and engagement, building on existing programs in Mexico (museums and mobile classrooms) and Minnesota (""Flyover Country"" mobile app), and to organize workshops for local K-12 teachers. A robust plan for evaluation of Broader Impacts is included. This project will contribute to the training of the next generation of geoscientists through the inclusion of students and postdoctoral researchers in the drilling project. This project will foster ties among scientific communities in the U.S., Europe and Mexico, both during drilling and continuing scientific investigations of the Chalco Basin. While the focus of this proposal is recovery of an environmental record, other groups have interest in utilizing the core or the boreholes for a range of studies including volcanic history and hazards, seismic monitoring and earthquake hazard modeling, as well as hydrological monitoring and teaching tools. No funding is provided for these related projects in the current grant.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This grant provides funding to recover a drill core from a >350m lacustrine sedimentary sequence contained in the Lake Chalco basin on the southern outskirts of Mexico City in the Basin of Mexico. These sediments have the potential to provide a >500,000 year record of North American climate. This will be a unique climate archive that could develop into the ""type sequence"" for paleoclimate studies in North America. Chalco is well suited for reconstruction and investigatation of interannual through orbital-scale variations in the North American Monsoon (NAM) and hydrologic variations of the neotropics. Ongoing work indicates that the system records environmental responses to both Milankovitch- and millennial-scale climate forcing. In order to evaluate the relative role of low latitudes in initiating and propagating abrupt global climate changes, information regarding the geographical distribution, patterns and timing of abrupt changes in the tropics is still needed, particularly records to help define the nature of variability in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Precipitation over the Chalco Basin is determined by the position of the ITCZ and the strength of the NAM. Long-term (orbital) variations in the position of the ITCZ follow insolation. However, Holocene paleoclimatic records show an antiphase pattern in precipitation intensity between the tropical core of the NAM and its northern margins in response to ocean forcing (e.g. Atlantic Meridional Overturn, AMO, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). A record from the Chalco basin can be compared with existing long term records to the North and to the South to determine if this antiphase relationship to AMO and PDO forcing existed in earlier interglacials.","hot_pink"

By most estimates, at least half of the world's approximately 6,000 languages will cease to be spoken by 2100. Although mass media have frequently been blamed for aggravating language loss, local communities have begun to develop their own radio and television programming as a grassroots means to increase the use of endangered languages. Understanding the effects of these grassroots projects to save endangered languages is crucial for creating context-sensitive programs and policies that will protect humanity's collective knowledge. The research funded by this award will focus on one such grassroots project. <br/><br/>University of Michigan doctoral student Georgia Ennis, under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Mannheim, will conduct research among the lowland Quichua in the Ecuadorian Amazon, where irreplaceable knowledge about the local ecosystem is threatened by ongoing language shift towards Spanish. She will focus on grassroots language revitalization programs being carried out by Amazonian Quichua through community radio stations. This setting is particularly appropriate for the research due to well-established community radio infrastructure in the region, which is now being consciously mobilized to increase the use of lowland Quichua. Studying radio may be especially productive, as it remains one of the most widespread, easy to use, and inexpensive media technologies. The investigator will assess whether radio production and broadcasting in an endangered language help maintain or even increase its use among listeners. She will also explore how media production may alter the speech of listeners and ultimately the language itself. The investigator will conduct long-term research at local radio stations and in Quichua communities in order to track the effects of radio media production and reception on language use. Data will be collected through multiple social science methods including surveys and observation of language use, habits of media consumption, and linguistic attitudes and beliefs. She will also collect and archive samples of language use by listeners and non-listeners for comparative analysis. The results of this research will provide insights into the viability of media production as a strategy for revitalization of endangered languages. Findings will also contribute to theories of how and why languages change.","maroon"

Microbial communities carry out critical processes that regulate the amounts and forms of important nutrients and carbon, which are essential for all ecosystem services on Earth. Results from the first five years of this research program demonstrated that the biodiversity and activity of these communities varies tremendously among environments and over time. Microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions are controlled (1) by local environmental conditions that affect growth, and (2) by dispersal via wind and water. However, the relative importance of these factors is still unknown. This research project will characterize these two fundamental controls on the distribution and activity of microbes in Arctic lakes, streams, and soils, and will reveal how seasonal, annual, and long-term shifts in microbial species are affected by climate change. This research will use the data archive of environmental measurements produced by the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER), and will use next-generation DNA sequencing technology to assess microbial community composition and function.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to measure shifts in microbial biodiversity, bacterial respiration, and ecosystem function associated with the current and dramatic environmental changes in the Arctic. Bacteria and other microbes ultimately control the production and consumption of the heat-trapping gases carbon dioxide and methane. In the Arctic, warming temperatures are thawing permafrost and exposing a vast store of previously-frozen organic carbon in soils. If this carbon is released to the atmosphere as heat-trapping gases the rate of climate warming will increase, further thawing the soils and exposing more carbon to microbial attack. The strength of this positive feedback loop is controlled by bacteria, because their respiration converts the soil carbon to carbon dioxide and methane which is then released to the atmosphere. In addition, this project will contribute to teaching and outreach through the NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates and Research Experience for Teachers programs, graduate student and postdoctoral scientist training, and collaboration with the Earth Microbiome Project (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org).","salmon"

The environment is sensitive to both climatic and environmental changes, but the degree to which these will affect the region is unknown. This project will examine lake cores collected from the region to establish a chronology of environmental change in the region that documents the response of the system to climate and can help evaluate the possible effects of human intervention. This is a collaborative project that is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE).<br/><br/>A technical description of the project<br/><br/>This RAPID project will examine how changing environmental conditions can (1) impact surface processes (e.g., erosion and weathering); and (2) influence landscape evolution in lowland tropical wetlands. The field site is the little- studied Pantanal of central South America. The Brazilian Pantanal offers an excellent example of extensive savanna-floodplain wetland development along several coalescing megafans (large distributive fluvial systems). The main objective of this research is to collect new lake sediment cores from a large floodplain lake in the northern Pantanal. Lake deposits are a potential archive of Quaternary landscape evolution, as the dynamics of sediment composition and accumulation are sensitive to environmental transitions. The project will use standard techniques to assess how the lake accumulates sediment today, and use these data as a framework for interpreting older material recovered from the lake cores.","hot_pink"

However, approximately 25 per cent of the buildings consist of reinforced concrete (RC) frames infilled with masonry walls. This structural system was widely used in the 1920s and 1930s in California as well as in the Pacific Northwest; hence, understanding the damage to this structural system from the Nepal earthquake has direct implications for the seismic performance of a large number of buildings in metropolitan areas in the United States. <br/><br/>This rapid response research will focus on post-earthquake assessment of existing RC building frames with masonry infill in Nepal. A team of three researchers and three graduate students will travel to Nepal to collect perishable field data and perform detailed assessments of the seismic performance of 25-30 buildings. The team will acquire, process, and archive architectural and structural data, including building drawings, in residential buildings and critical facilities such as schools and hospitals. The data will be obtained through visual inspections and geo-referenced, three-dimensional (3D), ground-based Lidar scans and Structure from Motion, i.e., 3D reconstructions from two-dimensional photographs, thus providing detailed, quantitative damage measurements. This collected data will be made publicly available to enable future research to advance computational modeling and structural analysis for understanding the seismic performance of RC frame with masonry infill buildings. This collected data will provide new earthquake reconnaissance case studies of RC frame with infill buildings and will be used to evaluate current U.S. guidelines for assessment of existing structures.

In order to clarify the relationships between bone microstructure and the controlling parameters of phylogeny and environment, I propose a study that documents histological variation (1) within single skeletons; (2) among vertebrate taxa; and (3) across distinctive habitats. Drought assemblages are the focal point of the study for several reasons. First, modern systems indicate that drought and its attendant hardships leave a signature in vertebrate hard tissues. Moreover, there is strong evidence that drought generates bonebeds in the vertebrate fossil record that constitute the archive of life history variation in ancient populations. The PI will first compare the bone tissue of vertebrates inhabiting the drought-prone ecosystem of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe with a sample of vertebrates derived from captivity and held in museum collections. Secondly, she will pursue similar questions and methods as she investigates fossil vertebrate assemblages from similar environmental contexts in the Late Cretaceous of Montana and Madagascar. This research takes the first necessary step toward ground-truthing the bone histological signals across vertebrate groups, environments, and time, and will provide a baseline appreciation of bone histological responses to ecological stress among taxonomic groups, body sizes, and even within single skeletons. Ultimately, this study will have far-reaching implications for paleobiologists and neontologists who use bone tissue to explore both modern and ancient biological systems.

Mockler (Oregon State University)<br/><br/><br/>This project investigates the genetic underpinnings of plant water use in the crop species Brassica rapa. Water-use efficiency is a critical determinant of yield in crops and fitness in wild species. The match between a plant's endogenous circadian rhythm and external abiotic conditions, including water stress, can dramatically affect physiological functions such as chlorophyll production, carbon fixation, and water loss through transpiration. Brassica rapa exhibits a strong association between circadian rhythms and both transpiration and water-use efficiency. Preliminary studies exploiting the genetic diversity present in two parental genotypes have identified at least ten genetically defined regions that affect water-use efficiency. Of these, six co-localize with genes affecting circadian clock function. This project will clone and characterize the gene or genes of one region, on Chromosome A7, that explains more than one-quarter of the variation in water-use efficiency. Identifying the underlying locus will be facilitated by experiments where water stress is imposed at the atmospheric and soil levels, and plant measurements quantify the connection between water supply and demand as well as plant carbon fixation and utilization. This project also will characterize the gene expression response to water stress and the influence of time of day on the magnitude of that response. This project will develop genetic resources akin to the maize Nested Association Mapping (NAM) lines that will explore the genetic diversity present in ~20 diverse parents. This should allow the identification of more genetic loci that contribute to water-use efficiency. These in turn will be fine-mapped and cloned, thus enhancing our understanding of the genetic basis of water-use efficiency in crop species. Enhanced understanding of the architecture of water-use efficiency in this crop species should facilitate efforts to breed for enhanced water-use efficiency in a wide range of crop species.<br/><br/>Given the profound implications to society of even small changes in crop water use on global hydrology, a thorough understanding of the genetic controls on and natural variation in plant water use and gas exchange is warranted to feed a rapidly growing global population with increasingly limited fresh water supplies. This project offers innovative educational opportunities at the high school, undergraduate, predoctoral and postdoctoral levels in quantitative molecular and classical genetic analysis and plant physiology. The project will train middle and high school teachers and develop educational modules that permit K-16 students to do hands on studies in classical and molecular genetics using a rapid-cycling strain of B. rapa. Annual summer institutes at University of Wisconsin - Madison will enhance the value of a resource to teach classical, molecular, and biochemical genetics at the K-12 and undergraduate levels that has already gained widespread acceptance in the classroom. Thus, the outreach aspects of this project should be manifest on a national level.

Tropical Pacific climate variability is dominated by ocean/atmosphere coupled dynamics associated with the El Niï¿½o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The traditional expression of ENSO is characterized by a pronounced eastern Pacific warming, a weakening of the trade winds, and positive (negative) Sea Level Pressure anomalies over the western (eastern) tropical Pacific. These changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation modify the large-scale Hadley Cell and extratropical atmospheric circulation patterns via atmospheric<br/>teleconnections. Specifically, it has been shown that ENSO extremes excite variability in the Aleutian Low through a well-known ""atmospheric bridge"". The ENSO-derived variability of the Aleutian Low is integrated and low-passed by the ocean to yield the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) pattern in the North Pacific. The recent discovery of a new dynamical link between a special type of ENSO (with a pronounced warming in the central Pacific) and the North Pacific Gyre provides the basis for a potential positive feedback between tropics and extra-tropics. This project will use an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach to diagnose the mechanisms controlling decadal-scale variations in the subsurface Pacific Ocean and their role in tropical Pacific decadal variability. An ensemble of six long-term Pacific eddy-resolving ocean model hindcasts for the period 1950-2012 will be generated to address two goals: The first goal is to characterize and diagnose the decadal variability of the subsurface mean and eddy circulations of the Pacific Ocean. The second goal is to understand the role of the subsurface dynamics that generate decadal modulations of the tropical thermocline. This will be accomplished using a linear inverse modeling framework based on observations, reanalysis products, and the model ensemble simulations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Until recently, the decadal variability of the North Pacific was understood in the context of the canonical eastern Pacific El Niï¿½o (EP-ENSO) and its decadal expression -- the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider (in their previous grant) expanded this view by recognizing a new decadal pattern of variability termed the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). By diagnosing the large-scale dynamics of the NPGO it was found that similar to the PDO the decadal variance of the NPGO originates from the tropics and is forced by a different flavor of central Pacific El Niï¿½o (CP-ENSO). This suggests that the tropical Pacific acts as a primary driver of Pacific-wide surface decadal variability. However, the dynamics controlling this source of decadal variance remain largely unknown. While many studies have explored subsurface pathways to tropical decadal variability with coarse resolution models and observations, the role of eddy-resolved dynamics has not been systematically explored. Yet in the subsurface where direct atmospheric forcing is weak, stochastic forcing by eddy-scale processes can generate and/or transport large-amplitude decadal anomalies in water mass properties. This study will take a fresh look at the mechanisms energizing the Pacific decadal variance in an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach that allows to resolve and isolate deterministic and intrinsic dynamics of ocean variability. This approach has never been used to study ocean decadal dynamics even though there is growing scientific evidence that eddy-scale processes exert an important control on ocean climate. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Improving our understanding of subsurface climate variability of the Pacific Ocean carries important implications for decadal climate prediction, and for biogeochemical and marine ecosystem sciences. Decadal changes in subsurface transport and water mass properties (e.g. oxygen & nutrients) are linked to dramatic coastal hypoxia events along the US west coast. The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider have acted and will continue to act as interdisciplinary communicators to bridge the physical and biological oceanography communities by making the modeling data, analyses and the new understandings derived from this project available to marine ecosystem scientists through a local environmental program and several international working groups that the lead investigators co-chair. The eddy-resolving hindcasts will also be made available through the Georgia Tech Data server and will provide an unprecedented data archive for exploring eddy-scale dynamics in the Pacific and for conducting regional climate impacts studies with nested coastal ocean models. The project will also train a female graduate student.","lavender"

Deciphering this poorly understood yet fundamental aspect of plant biology will shed light on the evolution of tree species and have important implications for forest ecology and growth dynamics. In a practical sense, the work will help transform the orchards and tree plantations of the future through the development of tree varieties suitable for high density planting- achieving productivity improvements analogous to those accomplished for cereal crops over the past half century. Commercial planting of these improved varieties will lead to more efficient land space utilization, reduction of chemical inputs, and increased industry profitability and sustainability. To integrate education and research and broaden participation, the project will provide research training in plant genomics for undergraduate and high school students from underrepresented minority groups. In addition, the project will organize and hold a series of workshops on plant architecture and biotechnology solutions that will educate growers and agricultural industry personnel about specific benefits biotechnology has to offer tree crops. Finally, the project will develop and hold short courses on a novel sequence-based mapping and gene identification method using pooled genomes or pnomes for fellow scientists working on trees and other horticultural crops. All data generated in this project will be accessible to the public through the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) Short Reads Archive databases and/or the Genome Database for Rosaceae (http://www.rosaceae.org/). <br/><br/>Trees can adopt a wide variety of architectural forms. Architectural plasticity plays important roles in forest ecosystems, agriculture, and landscape aesthetics. Tree architecture is a consequence of numerous developmental traits that include branching pattern, branch number, branch length, and branch angle. These traits are largely a function of two key developmental processes: apical dominance and apical control. Apical dominance is a well understood process that inhibits lateral bud outgrowth through signals emanating from the shoot apex. Intensive studies have revealed the signals and the underlying molecular mechanisms that operate in herbaceous plants such as Arabidopsis and pea. In contrast, apical control is the process by which the apex influences the overall tree structure upon successive years of growth and development in woody species. Although some progress has been made from a physiological perspective, the genetic and molecular mechanisms of apical control are largely unknown. The overarching goal of the project is to develop detailed knowledge about how trees adopt specific architectural forms, specifically with regard to apical control of the lateral branch angle and directional growth. Using a combination of genome-scale studies to elucidate key gene networks and molecular pathways coupled with innovative whole tree imaging technologies that will enable non-destructive structural phenotyping, the project will address the following questions: 1) What gene expression networks differentiate the shoot apical meristem from lateral meristems? What changes take place when a lateral shoot meristem transitions to becoming the apical meristem? How are these expression networks altered in branch angle mutants including pillar/columnar tree forms and weeping types? 2) What is the genetic and molecular basis for these mutant tree forms in peach and apple? What are the identities of the mutated genes? 3) With regard to the identified genes, what protein-protein interaction networks are they associated with? Through which pathways do they exert their effects on tree form?","teal"

Tropical Pacific climate variability is dominated by ocean/atmosphere coupled dynamics associated with the El Niï¿½o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The traditional expression of ENSO is characterized by a pronounced eastern Pacific warming, a weakening of the trade winds, and positive (negative) Sea Level Pressure anomalies over the western (eastern) tropical Pacific. These changes in the tropical atmospheric circulation modify the large-scale Hadley Cell and extratropical atmospheric circulation patterns via atmospheric<br/>teleconnections. Specifically, it has been shown that ENSO extremes excite variability in the Aleutian Low through a well-known ""atmospheric bridge"". The ENSO-derived variability of the Aleutian Low is integrated and low-passed by the ocean to yield the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) pattern in the North Pacific. The recent discovery of a new dynamical link between a special type of ENSO (with a pronounced warming in the central Pacific) and the North Pacific Gyre provides the basis for a potential positive feedback between tropics and extra-tropics. This project will use an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach to diagnose the mechanisms controlling decadal-scale variations in the subsurface Pacific Ocean and their role in tropical Pacific decadal variability. An ensemble of six long-term Pacific eddy-resolving ocean model hindcasts for the period 1950-2012 will be generated to address two goals: The first goal is to characterize and diagnose the decadal variability of the subsurface mean and eddy circulations of the Pacific Ocean. The second goal is to understand the role of the subsurface dynamics that generate decadal modulations of the tropical thermocline. This will be accomplished using a linear inverse modeling framework based on observations, reanalysis products, and the model ensemble simulations. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Until recently, the decadal variability of the North Pacific was understood in the context of the canonical eastern Pacific El Niï¿½o (EP-ENSO) and its decadal expression -- the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider (in their previous grant) expanded this view by recognizing a new decadal pattern of variability termed the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO). By diagnosing the large-scale dynamics of the NPGO it was found that similar to the PDO the decadal variance of the NPGO originates from the tropics and is forced by a different flavor of central Pacific El Niï¿½o (CP-ENSO). This suggests that the tropical Pacific acts as a primary driver of Pacific-wide surface decadal variability. However, the dynamics controlling this source of decadal variance remain largely unknown. While many studies have explored subsurface pathways to tropical decadal variability with coarse resolution models and observations, the role of eddy-resolved dynamics has not been systematically explored. Yet in the subsurface where direct atmospheric forcing is weak, stochastic forcing by eddy-scale processes can generate and/or transport large-amplitude decadal anomalies in water mass properties. This study will take a fresh look at the mechanisms energizing the Pacific decadal variance in an eddy-resolved ensemble modeling approach that allows to resolve and isolate deterministic and intrinsic dynamics of ocean variability. This approach has never been used to study ocean decadal dynamics even though there is growing scientific evidence that eddy-scale processes exert an important control on ocean climate. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Improving our understanding of subsurface climate variability of the Pacific Ocean carries important implications for decadal climate prediction, and for biogeochemical and marine ecosystem sciences. Decadal changes in subsurface transport and water mass properties (e.g. oxygen & nutrients) are linked to dramatic coastal hypoxia events along the US west coast. The PIs Di Lorenzo and Schneider have acted and will continue to act as interdisciplinary communicators to bridge the physical and biological oceanography communities by making the modeling data, analyses and the new understandings derived from this project available to marine ecosystem scientists through a local environmental program and several international working groups that the lead investigators co-chair. The eddy-resolving hindcasts will also be made available through the Georgia Tech Data server and will provide an unprecedented data archive for exploring eddy-scale dynamics in the Pacific and for conducting regional climate impacts studies with nested coastal ocean models. The project will also train a female graduate student.","lavender"

Though these records have great value and potential, important details about rates and patterns of carbon storage in annual growth layers (tree rings) remain poorly understood. These gaps in knowledge concern the basic natural history of the tissue that forms wood. This research, led by scientists from the University of Arizona and Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc., aims to improve the scientific basis for the use of tree ring records by compiling data sets of when key tree growth processes start each year, the rate at which each proceeds and for how long, and how daily to seasonal variations in climate conditions relate to the timing, rate, and magnitude of each process. This will be the first such study in the Western US. The research team will collect data at four clusters of sites in Wyoming, Colorado and Arizona, all centered on existing flux tower facilities and including the major tree types used in dendroclimatology in this large region. They will then compare the tree growth data with air, stem and soil temperature, water availability, sapflow and other factors, as well as phenological events such as shoot extension and needle elongation. These data and comparisons are essential for improving forward models of tree ring growth control. The methods, based on and informed by sound process models of the climate control of tree ring formation, have the potential to improve robustness, extend generality, and better assess the biological validity of climate reconstructions based on tree rings. Such methods are also central to emerging Bayesian techniques of paleoclimate reconstruction, and to attempts to test reconstruction methodologies using synthetic proxy records.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this research include improved understanding of past climates and improved understanding and prediction of responses of wood growth in western forests to recent or possible future climates. The latter is a significant practical concern, as much of the carbon in forests is stored in wood, and the results of this research will further inform projections of carbon allocation and storage in response to climate change. The project will involve undergraduate researchers in field and lab work and the publication of results. The PIs will engage in outreach both directly through public talks and media interviews as well as through the University of Arizona Extension Service.","fuchsia"

This major collection is important for understanding the rich history of life in western North America and the north Pacific from ~180 million years ago to Recent. The collection is diverse and contains many unique, undescribed and unrecorded species. These microfossils inform our understanding of ancient environments and past climates. Some are already being studied by international and national paleontologists, used by K-16 educators, and used in the preparation of public exhibits. This project proposes to archive images - and associated data - of these fossils into the Center's database and make them publically available on-line. As a result, the enormous potential of OCPC's holdings for research, training and outreach, previously hindered by inaccessibility, will be realized. These activities will be accomplished through improved security and preservation of OCPC through the application of modern storage and curatorial standards. <br/><br/>This project will enable The John D. Cooper Center to protect and preserve fossils recovered from OC by providing modern museum storage, including new cabinets and supporting infrastructure for approximately 100,000 fossils. Specimens will be inspected, repaired, uniquely numbered, and stored with a data card in museum trays placed in new cabinets arranged in stratigraphic order from Jurassic to Recent. Four CSUF graduate students will be employed, over the three years of the project, to assist with collection reorganization and curation. For each specimen, supporting data and images will be added to the Center's Specify 6 database by staff and volunteers. The proper storage of these specimens will allow reorganization of the remaining fossils, for which no funds are requested, and provide some room to decrease congestion. The application of modern curatorial standards, databasing and reorganization of OCPC will enable research by students, faculty and visiting scientists, and the collection's use in public events, exhibits and K-16 education.

Microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functions are controlled (1) by local environmental conditions that affect growth, and (2) by dispersal via wind and water. However, the relative importance of these factors is still unknown. This research project will characterize these two fundamental controls on the distribution and activity of microbes in Arctic lakes, streams, and soils, and will reveal how seasonal, annual, and long-term shifts in microbial species are affected by climate change. This research will use the data archive of environmental measurements produced by the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research program (LTER), and will use next-generation DNA sequencing technology to assess microbial community composition and function.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to measure shifts in microbial biodiversity, bacterial respiration, and ecosystem function associated with the current and dramatic environmental changes in the Arctic. Bacteria and other microbes ultimately control the production and consumption of the heat-trapping gases carbon dioxide and methane.

If this carbon is released to the atmosphere as heat-trapping gases the rate of climate warming will increase, further thawing the soils and exposing more carbon to microbial attack. The strength of this positive feedback loop is controlled by bacteria, because their respiration converts the soil carbon to carbon dioxide and methane which is then released to the atmosphere.

Increasingly, phylogenies are inferred in a Bayesian statistical framework, as it permits estimation under more complex and realistic statistical models from larger and increasingly complex datasets, and allows uncertainty in the resulting estimates to be clearly identified and accommodated. Implementation of BETAbase will substantially advance the field of Bayesian phylogenetic inference and, by extension, the myriad fields of biological sciences (including conservation, medicine, and agriculture) that rely on phylogenetic information. It will promote more rigorous and consistent evaluation of published phylogenetic studies thereby improving the quality of decisions based upon those studies.

What types of barriers affected this connectivity, and how permeable were these barriers to gene flow? The PIs will study how caballine horses, that inhabited ice-age Beringia (the biogeographic connector between Asia and North America), were affected by changes involving three different biogeographic barriers/corridors (1. the Bering Strait/Bering Land Bridge, which controlled dispersal and gene flow between Eurasia and Alaska; 2. the Ice-Free Corridor, which controlled gene flow between the Yukon and the Lower 48 States; and 3. biome shifts that periodically disrupted the spatial continuity of the Mammoth-Steppe, the unique ecosystem that stretched from France to the Yukon during the ice ages) during the last 30,000 years of the ice age. This study will evaluate the effects that each of these putative barriers to gene flow had on the abundance, distribution, and evolutionary trajectories of ice-age horses in the Arctic using new paleogenomic and paleoenvironmental data. The results will provide new insights into the roles played by environmental change and population fragmentation in determining extinction risk, and help predict how ongoing environmental changes will affect arctic ecosystems. This project will lead to advances in the rapidly developing field of paleogenetics and further the brand-new discipline of paleogenomic ecology.

Recently, new gateways for understanding social evolution have opened up due to advances in genomics, allowing unprecedented opportunities to study social behavior on a molecular level. By identifying which genes vary in their expression according to social roles, and how those genes have evolved across a range of social behavior, this project will shed light on the relative importance of particular genes in driving social evolution. Thus, it provides what previous studies lack. Specifically, it can clarify what types of genomic changes are important at each stage of social evolution. This step-wise approach to understanding social evolution provides major advantages over previous work, capitalizing on a unique group of carpenter bees where sociality varies from solitary to simple to complex social species. This study will incorporate students in research positions and integrate data sets into new courses. It will involve outreach activities for long-term pollinator biodiversity monitoring, including field surveys of native bees and citizen-science initiatives. A web-based interface is currently being developed to educate the public on native bees. This website will provide an interactive education tool on native pollinators to highlight their importance for agricultural, garden, and park sustainability.<br/><br/>For the first time, genomic tools can be used to test alternative hypotheses about the genomic basis of behavior, utilizing bee species with both simple and complex social behavior. This will be the first study to determine the types of genomic changes associated with the earliest origins of simple sociality and its subsequent elaboration into complex sociality. It utilizes a unique clade of carpenter bees where social behavior ranges enormously, from solitary to complex with many intermediate and very weakly social species. Transcriptomic assays and genome sequence comparisons will be assessed within a phylogenetic context to determine whether transitions from simple forms of cooperation to more complex societies are associated with differential expression of key genes, changes in the structure of those genes, or both. The project involves the following three key components: 1) Development of bee genome databases, where the genomes of six species will be assembled and annotated in order to provide basic information on the gene complement and functional categories of taxonomically restricted genes and to understand gene family expansion/contraction in each species. 2) Comparisons of gene expression, which will use transcriptomic comparisons across species to understand which elements of solitary behavior (foraging, reproduction) are associated with the origin and maintenance of sociality. 3) Adaptive evolution in genes and regulatory elements across the genome, which will involve sequence comparisons of genes and cis-regulatory elements across focal species to determine whether social transitions have involved adaptive changes in DNA sequences in addition to differential gene expression. The proposed project moves beyond all previous genomic studies of ants, honey bees, and social wasps by being able to capture the genetic events associated with changes at the dawn of sociality. Data will be deposited on the NCBI whole genome shotgun (WGS), functional genomic (GEO) and short read archive (SRA), and information will be provided in accordance with NCBI standards. All data will be released to NCBI upon submission for publication.","teal"

Their rise to dominance causes declines in abundance of small-bodied fishes, rise in abundance of invertebrates, and high concentrations of algae, including noxious species that form toxic blooms in nutrient-rich lakes. These modifications are accompanied by changes in lake productivity and availability of nutrients that limit the productivity in many lakes. Often the populations of top predators and the food web structure that they enforce appear to be stable, persisting for many years. However, the factors that stabilize dominant populations of top predators are not well understood. The researchers will investigate if material transported from land, including dissolved as well as large particles such as leaves, help to support the production of top predators and thereby stabilize their dominance in lake food webs. The investigators will archive data collected from the study lakes since 1984 and make them available to the public. Multiple students will be trained during the course of this project and the findings from this study will be communicated to the public through blog postings. <br/><br/>The investigators in a series of experiments from 1984-2015 in a suite of lakes investigated stability and change in food webs in response to predator harvest and stocking as well as nutrient enrichment. Other experiments studied the contributions of terrestrial organic matter to production of many consumers including large-bodied long-lived fishes. So far, however, the individual experiments have been analyzed separately. A comprehensive evaluation of the full set of experiments is needed to determine the role of terrestrial organic matter in food web patterns and the response of food webs to harvest, stocking and nutrient enrichment. More specifically, existing data from whole lake experiments will be used to investigate: (1) the interactive effects of nutrients, terrestrial dissolved organic matter (DOM), and consumer assimilation of terrestrial organic matter (allochthony) on the biomass of herbivorous zooplankton and the capacity of large-bodied grazers to withstand predation, (2) the effects of terrestrial prey on the stability and resilience of lake food webs and the strength of trophic cascades, and (3) the regulation of whole-ecosystem respiration by nutrients, terrestrial DOM, and food web structure. Beyond this contribution to basic science, the project will create an online, publicly-available database of data from the 32 years of whole lake experiments, train students in the use of large-scale experimental data, and create blog posts that present results of the research for a general audience.","salmon"

Among the most important and basic climate system components are the heat, freshwater, and carbon content and transport of the oceans, which directly interact with other essential components of the climate system in the atmosphere and cryosphere. In turn the associated variability and trends in the ocean's carbon content, carbonate saturation state, oxygen, and nutrients impact its internal biological environment, with notable large-scale regional changes. This joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is critical to identify critical areas where changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic carbon uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean's transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements. Results to date have shown that the abyssal ocean is warming, taking up to 30% of the excess heat in the entire Earth system, leading to changes in circulation patterns and ventilation rates in the upper ocean. The uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean has been mapped and shows that the oceans are acidifying. Oxygen concentrations are declining in the ocean thermocline, and tropical oxygen minimum zones are expanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community and need to be made quickly and freely available to the community at large through a recognized international data center. The project will continue to promote training and learning for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists in sea-going work. Outreach activities will continue as opportunities arise.<br/><br/>The systematic and global re-occupation of select ocean hydrographic sections conducted for the past decade (2003-2014) will be extended into the 2015-2020 period with the continued objective of quantifying changes in the full-depth ocean. The project is in support of the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. This long-standing project continues to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers. This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data. Post-cruise data updates, distribution, and archive will continue to be managed by groups with separate funding. This ongoing project is integrated with a larger international effort to monitor the ocean's response to climate change.","lavender"

Specifically, the researchers seek to understand how and to what extent the community development work of faith-based organizations reinforces or challenges the racial inequalities that underlie urban poverty. Through a case study of one faith-based organization's work in Atlanta, Georgia, researchers will investigate the manner in which faith-based community development organizations understand the connection of race to the Christian community development framework and the impact of their activities on neighborhood development and the alleviation of racial inequality. The study will provide the historically significant African American neighborhood of South Atlanta with an Oral Histories and Futures in Atlanta Neighborhoods online audio and video archive that will include recordings of residents from a range of Atlanta neighborhoods. The research will also be used to engage in constructive conversations with faith-based organizations and nonprofits or policymaking bodies that seek to make cities better places for all people to live, particularly those marginalized along racial lines. To fulfill this goal, the researchers will disseminate research findings at a wide range of conferences and meetings.<br/><br/>Scholarship on race, the literature on the resurgence of religious faith in cities, and cultural geographies of religion form the theoretical cornerstones of the project. Using this conceptual framework, the research examines the processes by which participants in faith-based organizational networks interpret the significance of race and create racial meanings through their work. Specifically, the researchers will examine what such understandings imply for faith-based organizations' roles in shaping cities, and how these meanings are reinforced, in conflict, or contested. To address these questions, the researchers will engage in direct and participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and document collection with members of faith-based organizations. The Christian Community Development Association (CCDA), a national network of evangelical Christian groups working in cities, is the project's primary case study subject. Data will be analyzed using critical discourse analysis techniques and an interpretive method that is attentive to on-the-ground complexities and contradictions.","maroon"

Additionally, both pre- and post-conference events will be held in Vancouver, Edmonton, and Banff. The week before SMC 2014, a String-Math Summer School will be held at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC. The week following SMC 2014 features two Satellite Workshops in Alberta: ""Calabi-Yau Manifolds and their Moduli"" at the University of Alberta and ""Quantum Curves and Quantum Knot Invariants"" at the Banff International Research Station for Mathematical Innovation and Discovery (BIRS). The String-Math Conferences are a series of large meetings bringing together mathematicians and physicists who work on ideas related to string theory. The nature of interactions between mathematicians and physicists has been thoroughly transformed in recent years. String theory, as well as quantum field theory, has contributed a series of profound ideas which gave rise to entirely new mathematical fields and revitalized older ones. By now there is a large and rapidly growing number of both mathematicians and physicists working at the string-theoretic interface between the two academic fields. The influence flows in both directions, with mathematical techniques and ideas contributing crucially to major advances in string theory.<br/><br/>For mathematics, string theory has been a source of many significant inspirations, ranging from Seiberg-Witten theory in four-manifolds, to enumerative geometry and Gromov-Witten theory in algebraic geometry, to work on the Jones polynomial in knot theory, to advances in symplectic topology, to recent progress in the geometric Langlands program and the development of derived algebraic geometry and n-category theory. In the other direction, mathematics has provided physicists with powerful tools, ranging from powerful differential geometric techniques for solving or analyzing key partial differential equations, to toric geometry, to K-theory and derived categories in D-branes, to the analysis of Calabi-Yau manifolds and string compactifications, to the use of modular forms and other arithmetic techniques. This mutual interaction has enhanced the depth, power, and novelty of the results obtained in both fields. This award provides partial support for travel and lodging to advanced students and postdoctoral participants. Participation of young researchers and those from underrepresented groups is actively encouraged. The results presented at the conference will be disseminated through a conference web site <br/><br/>https://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/stringmath2014/<br/><br/>and through the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences online video archive <br/><br/>www.mathtube.org<br/><br/>which will host video recordings of the talks, slides, and notes.","silver"

Major advances in understanding the health effects of human microbiomes have resulted from using gnotobiotic animal systems, in which germ-free animals are exposed to defined microbiomes to study their effects. Gnotobiotic systems to study microbiome function in plants are harder to implement because plant microbiomes are a combination of internal and external (e.g. soil) components. This project will use a gnotobiotic system developed for rice plants, in which root-associated microbiomes from different sources or conditions can be transplanted, and established in plants grown under controlled conditions. The project will enable the discovery of specific functions of plant microbiomes at the molecular level, and the evaluation of the impact of microbiomes on plant performance. Understanding the interactions of the host plant with its microbiome, and subsequent effects on crop performance and yields, provides possibilities for exploiting plant-microbe associations for future crop improvement. A second aim of the project addresses the concern that agriculture is a major source of global emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Rice cultivation worldwide is estimated to contribute nearly half of these emissions by promoting the growth of methane producing microbes. The project will examine the effects of different rice varieties on methane producing microbes, as well as methane consuming microbes, found in rice root-associated microbiomes. The findings can lead to strategies for reducing methane emissions from paddy fields, and reduce the impacts of rice cultivation on climate change. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research internships for selected undergraduate students from University of Arkansas-Pine Bluff, a Historically Black University.<br/><br/>The project will use genomic approaches to understand the impact of microbial associations on the crop plant rice (Oryza sativa). Preliminary data show that root microbiomes of soil grown rice plants are modulated by several environmental factors, including soil type, cultivation practice and drought, suggesting that changes to microbiomes constitute part of the plant adaptation to the environment. The growth preference of rice for semi-aquatic substrates has been exploited to establish a gnotobiotic rice model, such that plants grown under controlled conditions can acquire a defined microbiome. In this project, microbiomes used for transplantation will be characterized by 16SrDNA sequencing to identify the constituent taxa, and the transcriptomes of the treated rice plants will be studied using RNAseq. The transcriptional responses of gnotobiotic rice plants with transplanted microbiomes from different sources and stress treatments, including drought stress, will be analyzed for global changes in gene expression, as well as specific functional classes of genes that might reflect adaptive responses by the plant induced by the microbiome. Lastly, the association of archaea with cultivated rice, a significant contribution to planetary methane emissions, and potentially to climate change, will be investigated. Specifically, the effects of genotype on methanogenic archaea and methanotrophic bacteria, as well as computationally identified associated microbial networks in field grown rice, will be characterized, towards the goal of breeding low emission rice. Plant transcriptomic and microbial sequence data generated by the project will be released through public databases that include the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA), respectively.","teal"

But how do young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species? Here, the researchers investigate the genomic, neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of species recognition employed by avian brood parasites, birds whose eggs are laid into nests of strangers and whose chicks are raised by the foster species. By identifying the password--a species-specific vocalization that attracts and initiates the neural mechanisms by which young brood parasites identify individuals of their own species--the researchers will be able to understand how young that naturally lack contact with parents recognize members of their own species. This work will contribute broadly to scientific progress in the fields of learning and memory, behavioral plasticity and behavioral evolution. This research program involves training of students and young scientists, including a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of students, including many underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in integrative behavioral, neurobiological, and genomics research techniques. The participants will deliver public seminars and exhibits at Sylvan Heights Bird Park in North Carolina and at several non-profit organizations in New York City.<br/><br/>The suite of behavioral innovations underlying social parasitism, including avian brood parasitism, must include mechanisms to recognize conspecifics without prior exposure during early development. This project will tap into the developmental knowledge already gathered from parental songbirds, including the zebra finch model system, and focus the ontogenetic study on a closely-related, but obligate parasitic finch, the pin-tailed whydah. The aim is to test the general hypothesis that differences in neural architecture or processing between parasitic and parental birds reflect evolutionary tinkering, whereby novel traits arise by modification of existing networks and structures. Through experimentally manipulated exposure of juvenile parasites to songs, the prediction will be tested that conspecific recognition relies on hearing a salient species-specific character, termed the password. Detailed quantitative patterns of transcriptional change following password exposure, and throughout developmental landmarks, will be collected to identify neurogenomic signatures associated with the timing and induction of conspecific recognition and to more broadly define the molecular basis of experience-dependent or developmentally driven neuroplasticity. Critical acoustic and behavioral components of these data will be collected during a newly developed field course in Puerto Rico. Acoustic and video data will be made freely available through DataOne, a public data repository, and genomic data will be deposited into the National Institutes of Health's NCBI short read archive.","teal"

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Nathanael Ellis is ""Identifying molecular networks underlying root-root interactions in high plant density adapted maize."" The host institutions for the fellowship are the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the Washington University School of Medicine, and the lead sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christopher Topp, with co-sponsoring scientist Dr. Yuan-Chuan Tai.<br/><br/>Since the 1930's, annual gains in U.S. maize production have largely been driven by the adaptation of maize plants to increasing plant density. Two historically important maize populations, Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic and Corn Borer, have been recurrently selected for increased hybrid grain yield, resulting in density adapted plants. Preliminary work suggests that not only have root architectures changed in these populations, but their sensing and growth responses to neighboring root systems have changed as well, pointing to a new paradigm for understanding the key process of crop density adaptation. This project aims to identify the molecular mechanisms of adaptation to high plant density in maize roots. Thus the research will contribute to our basic understanding of how roots, the ""hidden-half"" of plants, communicate with one another, and exploit this knowledge for crop improvement. The broader impacts include synergistic training between plant biologists and medical imaging experts, as well as leveraging the project research objectives to develop teaching tools in a classroom experience for underserved students. Training will include: bioinformatics, genomics, advanced image analysis methods, analysis of complex 3D structures, and statistical approaches to quantify the dynamics of plant metabolism.<br/><br/><br/>Shoot architectures, specifically increased leaf angles, are known outcomes of selection during maize density adaptation, but little empirical data exists about the contribution from roots. Selected cycles from progressively density adapted germplasm will be assayed in several ways to quantify root system architecture of plants grown individually or paired, to identify changes in root growth as a function of density adaption. In this project, the effects of density adaptation on 3D root architecture and growth will be assayed by Optical Projection Tomography (OPT), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to study dynamic carbon allocation. These efforts will identify the most relevant time points from which to sample leaf and root tissue for transcriptional profiling, as well as profiling of root exudates via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This project will contribute to modelling the relationship of carbon allocation and root growth in respect to root-root communication and to identify the underlying genetic mechanisms controlling these processes. Results from this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals, as well as communicated at scientific conferences. Data will be uploaded to appropriate publicly accessible websites, including the NCBI Sequence Read Archive in association with the maizegdb.org/expression database, as well as the Proteomics Identifications database.","teal"

With over forty years of data on the same families and their descendents, the PSID is a cornerstone of data infrastructure for social science research. Through its long-term measures of economic and social well being, the study allows researchers and policy analysts to investigate the dynamism inherent in social and behavioral process. The long panel, genealogical design, and broad content provide scientists a unique and powerful opportunity to study evolution and chance within the same family over decades. <br/><br/>This award funds three primary activities: designing the PSID questionnaire content to facilitate the investigation of emerging scientific and policy questions in response to new events and new theories, collecting two new waves of data from the several thousand PSID families through computer-assisted telephone interviews, and methodological improvements in data processing and distribution that will make the data available quickly and easily to researchers around the globe through the PSID website. Collecting these additional waves of data from the PSID families contributes to scientific understanding of the dynamics of economic and social behavior. The extended time series of data supports new and systematic investigation of a myriad of questions in the full range of scientific disciplines that study how humans grow and change over the life cycle. This includes the study of economic outcomes (such as the changes that occur across business cycles such as the Great Recession), of the intergenerational transmission of wealth and income, and the study of how income and health in adulthood and old age depend on early-life experiences.<br/><br/>Consistent measures over time are important for accurately estimating the dynamics of these behaviors. Gathering data from the same families over a long time period improves the precision of the measurement as multiple measures are collected within the same families as well as from multiple families over a period of decades. In addition, because the PSID now tracks up to four generations of a family, the data will allow scientists to study several rounds of intergenerational changes. The core survey content will remain stable to maintain comparability with earlier waves. The PIs will carry out numerous innovations and enhancements, including new content on the measurement of health and human capital; linkages to valuable administrative data; and implementing a web/mail survey to study a new content area and experiment with new interviewing methods.<br/><br/>The PSID creates broader impacts in many ways. It is used by an interdisciplinary community and is increasingly important in health research. The data archive is used to inform public policy; at least nine federal agencies use PSID data. The PSID is also an important resource for teaching and learning. The data are free and publicly available, and are widely used by graduate and undergraduate students. The award funds a number of web-based outreach activities that will make the PSID an even more valuable tool for teaching and learning.","crimson"

In contrast, little is known about terrestrial environments or ecosystems. A lack of data and suitably unaltered successions means that intense speculation surrounds the few hypotheses that exist regarding environmental conditions on land at this time. The investigators wish to study rocks that are situated in a unique time and place in the history of Earth and life, and are ideally placed for exploring the terrestrial biosphere during the rise of crown group eukaryotes and the composition of the ancient atmosphere. If the datasets are not compromised by diagenesis (a question this study will address directly using clumped isotope paleothermometry), then this succession has the potential to answer several outstanding questions about the evolution of life and climate. The project has numerous societal benefits. It will support the career development of at least two women scientists, the raining of a postdoctoral researcher, and new collaborations including with an international collaborator. It will be used to broaden participation and to promote diversity, including outreach activities to under-represented students. Project participants will conduct outreach to K-12 students. It will also support education as results will be included in lectures to undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>The investigators propose a brief initial exploratory investigation to determine the potential of an unburied 1 billion year old succession from Michigan for the study of terrestrial environments during the rise of the eukaryotes. Carbonates in the 1.09 Ga Copper Harbor conglomerate of northern Michigan represent a potentially transformative archive of paleoclimatic and geobiological information. The succession contains terrestrial stromatolites that developed on an ancient alluvial fan, as well as lacustrine stromatolites. Researchers will conduct preliminary analyses of a suite of pilot samples from both facies to explore preservation and collect pilot data on proxy signatures, including on clumped isotopes and redox sensitive proxies. This work will allow to assess preservation and the utility of future in depth study of these rocks to provide proxy data for a crucial period in Earth's geobiological evolution. If successful, researchers will follow up with a collaborative, in-depth study of the succession. The potential rewards from future research are huge - but the risks of trying to find and identify unaltered rocks from this time period would preclude a study of this nature from being funded through traditional NSF programs until a suite of pilot data is collected.","hot_pink"

Four research activities are planned to address this goal: (1) Quantify uncertainty in lidar estimates of dissipation, (2) Quantify the variability of dissipation through the construction of a data archive consisting of measurements classified by different meteorological and physical conditions, (3) Compare simulated dissipation variability to observations using WRF and WRF-LES modeling systems, (4) Test new parameterizations that do not assume locally balanced turbulence production and dissipation.","fuchsia"

An algorithm audit uses controlled experiments to examine an algorithmic system, such as an online service or big data information archive, and ascertain (1) how it functions, and (2) whether it may cause harm. Examples of documented harms by algorithms include discrimination, racism, and unfair trade practices. Although there is rising awareness of the potential for algorithmic systems to cause harm, actually detecting this harm in practice remains a key challenge. Given that most algorithms of concern are proprietary and non-transparent, there is a clear need for methods to conduct black-box analyses of these systems. Numerous regulators and governments have expressed concerns about algorithms, as well as a desire to increase transparency and accountability in this area.<br/><br/>This research will develop methodologies to audit algorithms in three domains that impact many people: online markets, hiring websites, and financial services. Auditing algorithms in these three domains will require solving fundamental methodological challenges, such as how to analyze systems with large, unknown feature sets, and how to estimate feature values without ground-truth data. To address these broad challenges, the research will draw on insights from prior experience auditing personalization algorithms. Additionally, each domain also brings unique challenges that will be addressed individually. For example, novel auditing tools will be constructed that leverage extensive online and offline histories. These new tools will allow examination of systems that were previously inaccessible to researchers, including financial services companies. Methodologies, open-source code, and datasets will be made available to other academic researchers and regulators. This project includes two integrated educational objectives: (1) to create a new computer science course on big data ethics, teaching how to identify and mitigate harmful side-effects of big data technologies, and (2) production of web-based versions of the auditing tools that are designed to be accessible and informative to the general public, that will increase transparency around specific, prominent algorithmic systems, as well as promote general education about the proliferation and impact of algorithmic systems.","indigo"

Hypotheses to explain how the ocean regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide have long been debated, but they have proven to be difficult to test. Work proposed here will test one leading hypothesis, specifically that the ocean experienced greater density stratification during the ice ages. That is, with greater stratification during the ice ages and slower replacement of deep water by cold dense water formed near the poles, the deep ocean would have held more carbon dioxide, which is produced by biological respiration of the organic carbon that constantly rains to the abyss in the form of dead organisms and organic debris that sink from the sunlit surface ocean. To test this hypothesis, the degree of ocean stratification during the last ice age and the rate of deep-water replacement will be constrained by comparing the radiocarbon ages of organisms that grew in the surface ocean and at the sea floor within a critical region around Antarctica, where most of the replacement of deep waters occurs. Completing this work will contribute toward improved models of future climate change. Climate scientists rely on models to estimate the amount of fossil fuel carbon dioxide that will be absorbed by the ocean in the future. Currently the ocean absorbs about 25% of the carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels. Most of this carbon is absorbed in the Southern Ocean (the region around Antarctica). How this will change in the future is poorly known. Models have difficulty representing physical conditions in the Southern Ocean accurately, thereby adding substantial uncertainty to projections of future ocean uptake of carbon dioxide. Results of the proposed study will provide a benchmark to test the ability of models to simulate ocean processes under climate conditions distinctly different from those that occur today, ultimately leading to improvement of the models and to more reliable projections of future absorption of carbon dioxide by the ocean. <br/><br/>The proposed work will add a research component to an existing scientific expedition to the Southern Ocean, in the region between the Ross Sea and New Zealand, that will collect sediment cores at three to five locations down the northern flank of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge at approximately 170ï¿½W. The goal is to collect sediments at each location deposited since early in the peak of the last ice age. This region is unusual in the Southern Ocean in that sediments deposited during the last ice age contain foraminifera, tiny organisms with calcium carbonate shells, in much greater abundance than in other regions of the Southern Ocean. Foraminifera are widely used as an archive of several geochemical tracers of past ocean conditions. In the proposed work the radiocarbon age of foraminifera that inhabited the surface ocean will be compared with the age of contemporary specimens that grew on the seabed. The difference in age between surface and deep-swelling organisms will be used to discriminate between two proposed mechanisms of deep water renewal during the ice age: formation in coastal polynyas around the edge of Antarctica, much as occurs today, versus formation by open-ocean convection in deep-water regions far from the continent. If the latter mechanism prevails, then it is expected that surface and deep-dwelling foraminifera will exhibit similar radiocarbon ages. In the case of dominance of deep-water formation in coastal polynyas, one expects to find very different radiocarbon ages in the two populations of foraminifera. In the extreme case of greater ocean stratification during the last ice age, one even expects the surface dwellers to appear to be older than contemporary bottom dwellers because the targeted core sites lie directly under the region where the oldest deep waters return to the surface following their long circuitous transit through the deep ocean. The primary objective of the proposed work is to reconstruct the water mass age structure of the Southern Ocean during the last ice age, which, in turn, is a primary factor that controls the amount of carbon dioxide stored in the deep sea. In addition, the presence of foraminifera in the cores to be recovered provides a valuable resource for many other paleoceanographic applications, such as: 1) the application of nitrogen isotopes to constrain the level of nutrient utilization in the Southern Ocean and, thus, the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, 2) the application of neodymium isotopes to constrain the transport history of deep water masses, 3) the application of boron isotopes and boron/calcium ratios to constrain the pH and inorganic carbon system parameters of ice-age seawater, and 4) the exploitation of metal/calcium ratios in foraminifera to reconstruct the temperature (Mg/Ca) and nutrient content (Cd/Ca) of deep waters during the last ice age at a location near their source near Antarcitca.","plum"

Many outstanding problems in star formation, including the origin of star masses and the rate of star formation, rely on first, accurately determining how much molecular gas there is and, second, how energetic that gas is. However, there is no single perfect tracer for all gas densities and temperatures. The most abundant molecule within molecular clouds, molecular hydrogen (H2), is virtually invisible. Consequently, obtaining fundamental information requires understanding the relation between H2 and the emission of other less abundant species, which are all complex functions of the local environment. This research will provide a basis for understanding chemical distributions in different star-forming environments and will focus on the relationship between H2 and easily observable molecules, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN).<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to investigate the evolution of chemical abundances and line emission in star-forming molecular clouds as a function of star formation activity. The investigator will perform numerical simulations of turbulent, star-forming clouds that include magneto-hydrodynamics, radiative transfer, gravity and feedback from stars. This project will use full chemical networks coupled with multi-physics molecular cloud simulations to study the relationship between observations and underlying physical quantities. The investigator will quantitatively explore three fundamental questions: How does the relation between atomic carbon, CO, and HCN emission and H2 density evolve as a function of star formation activity? How well do tracers, such as CO and HCN, probe the gas energetics and correlate with total star formation? What is the impact of kinematic feedback due to proto-stellar outflows on astrochemistry? <br/><br/>This work has implications for estimating the total molecular gas mass, star formation efficiency, and the correspondence between molecular cloud properties (temperature, mass, velocity dispersion) and the star formation rate. They plan to archive and share the abundance and emission maps with the astronomy community through the website ""Dataverse"". This will allow comparison with observations, including Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data, for a wide range of species, cloud conditions, and physical scales.

PGC provides products and services including: mapping and GIS analysis; access to sub-meter commercial satellite imagery for the Antarctic and Arctic; expertise to task, manage, process and deliver high-level value-added products to the NSF polar community; domain and institutional knowledge to solve a broad range of geospatial problems; and educational courses including online material to transfer PGC?s knowledge and experience to the community. The PGC is collaborating with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency to create a publicly available high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) of the entire Arctic from high-resolution satellite imagery. These data will be used by the Arctic community to support activities including transportation, national defense, land management, sustainable development, and scientific studies.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/>The Polar Geospatial Center (PGC) facilitates access to geospatial resources and knowledge for the polar community. PGC staff has a direct one-to-one relationship with each user, tailoring product delivery to the expertise and needs of the user?s specific science or logistics goals. To this end, PGC maintains an extensive online archive of sub-meter electro-optical commercial imagery licensed through the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency?s (NGA) EnhancedView program. PGC works to automate labor-intensive processing workflows using the Extreme Science and Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and Blue Waters high performance computing infrastructures, and is developing a web-based imagery and geospatial product delivery system (FRIDGE; Federal Research Imagery Download and Geodata Exploration). This delivery system is based around a task management and queuing tool that interfaces with PGC?s user management database and PGC?s HPC cluster. Polar digital elevation models (DEM) will be produced using the Surface Extraction from TIN-based Search-space Minimization (SETSM) algorithm and the Ames Stereo Pipeline. These products have an expected accuracy of 4m without ground control and sub-meter accuracy when ground control is used. A key component of PGC's mission is training of today's young geospatial students in the use of imagery to solve scientific problems. PGC offers workshops, online instructional material, and collaborative imagery processing workflow development. PGC?s goal is to provide rapid and cost-effective access to geospatial data and education for the purpose of promoting polar science.","plum"

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease. Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies. It will also train and educate numerous, undergraduates and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/>This research builds on data from a long-term study of the population dynamics of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae and Rana muscosa) in the complex landscape of the California Sierra Nevada, and the impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as it has invaded and spread through hundreds of frog populations. In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions. In some cases however long-term persistence of frog populations occurs with Bd in an enzootic state in which the impact of the pathogen is greatly reduced. The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence. Cutting-edge genomic analysis of existing swab samples will be combined with continued surveys of field populations to identify new disease outbreaks and describe the transition from outbreak to enzootic state, collection of Bd cultures and frog mucosal samples from field populations, and laboratory experiments on Bd virulence and frog","salmon"

An important part of Arctic ecosystems and Aboriginal livelihood, wild reindeer have been monitored by scientists for almost 50 years. During this time, herds have exhibited large changes in size and these changes have been recorded in almost all herds across the animal?s range. The increase in the number of wild reindeer 20-30 years ago was almost universally followed by a significant population loss in the last decade. In addition, recent monitoring revealed substantial shifts in the distribution of wild populations. The decline in wild reindeer is likely related to natural cycles and changes in the Arctic environment caused by climate change and increased anthropogenic activity. In order to explain the observed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer, it is necessary to collect long-term and seasonal observations. The Taimyr Reindeer Herd (TRH) is both the largest and the longest monitored wild reindeer herd in Eurasia. The Extreme North Agricultural Research Institute in Noril?sk, Russia, has observed the TRH since 1969. Only a limited amount of the information on the TRH has been released, digitized, processed, analyzed or published. Much of the information is held in single-copy paper in locations and under conditions that threaten its longevity. The proposed project aims to digitize all available past records concerning the Taimyr wild reindeer populations and develop related datasets on climate and habitat over the decades of observation. <br/><br/>The Taimyr Reindeer Migration Reanalysis (TAMARA) project will be based upon a collaborative and integrated interdisciplinary international network of reindeer experts, arctic researchers, and geospatial scientists. The project is designed to build a comprehensive and openly available information system that will provide insight into the historical relationship between humans, climate, environment, and reindeer. Building on both international and local experiences the investigators will implement a major data digitization and dissemination effort that will be a considerable contribution to the polar cyberinfrastructure pertaining to Arctic terrestrial mammals. The project has the following objectives: 1) Retrieve, digitize, archive, transfer, process and publish historical observational data collected between 1969 and 2009, document relevant methodologies, and develop appropriate metadata; 2) Develop value-added data products resulting from the (re)analysis of historical spatial migration patterns of the TRH; and 3) Contribute to developing polar spatial cyberinfrastructure by creating a comprehensive and open data visualization and data dissemination system. The TAMARA project will be an integral part of the worldwide network of reindeer observation programs. The project will involve US and Russian scientists and students, supporting one graduate student and two part-time undergraduates. Results will be widely disseminated to local residents and stakeholders. The project will contribute to the early career development of a young investigator.","plum"

These systems are being developed to aid users with motor deficits stemming from neurodegenerative disease, injury, or even environmental restrictions which make movement difficult or impossible. One of the most successful classes of EEG-driven BCI systems is the P300, which works by detecting user responses to flashed stimuli. In most P300 systems, a grid of letters and/or other symbols is presented and rows or columns of the symbols are flashed in random order; the user attends to the desired symbol (usually by silently counting when it flashes). A major problem with these grid-based P300 systems is that the user must ideally look at the flashed target and minimally attend to the tiny letters, but late-stage ALS and other locked-in patients for whom these systems are most needed have trouble foveating targets and making controlled eye movements. The PI's hypothesis is that a BCI that flashes segments of one large letter can retain the combinatorial efficiency that comes with querying several letters at once, while having the advantage of one central focus (no gaze shifts required). This research aims to design and test this new segment speller idea. Project outcomes have the potential to vastly improve the usability of P300 EEG-based BCI systems for those with visual, sensory and motor impairments. All software written for EEG signal processing and analysis will be made available as add-ons to EEGLAB which is distributed by the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) at UCSD and part of the Temporal Dynamics of Learning Center. Data will also be made available through the HeadIT data archive that is also run by the SCCN.<br/><br/>This research task can be broken down into three main objectives: develop and test the response to flashed segments; improve the single-trial classification of the responses to flashed segments; and design a logic for selecting segments and interpreting their responses. The developed system will provide another method for BCI speller control that does not depend on the ability to shift gaze. The PI argues that this method will have a higher information transfer rate than other space invariant BCI spellers due to being able to probe multiple letters at once. Besides being advantageous for those with impaired eye movements and/or impaired vision, the method should have other advantages over the standard P300 systems. When errors are made, they will tend to be to visually similar symbols. Incorporating language priors and active segment selection is easily accommodated, and this may result in higher information transfer rates with slower flash rates. In addition the work on improving recognition of single-trial temporal EEG signals and incorporating Bayesian language models into spellers could be useful for other types of brain-computer interfaces.","indigo"

By replacing the existing network with modern software defined network (SDN) infrastructure, researchers will benefit from both the increased speed of the underlying network hardware and also from the ability to utilize SDN paths that avoid traditional policy enforcement bottlenecks. As a result, researchers across the campus will see significantly faster data transfers, enabling them to more effectively carry out their research.<br/><br/>This project builds on and extends a successful initial SDN deployment at the University of Kentucky, adding SDN switches to ten research buildings and connecting each of them to the existing SDN research network core with 40G uplinks. To ensure high-speed access to the Internet/Cloud, the research core network is being linked through a new 100 Gbps link to Internet2. Research traffic in the enabled buildings is automatically routed onto the SDN research network where SDN flow rules allow research traffic to bypass legacy network infrastructure designed to police normal traffic. By extending the SDN network capabilities to several new buildings on campus, a wide range of researchers are able to archive significantly higher network throughput for their research data.","mauve"

The investigator will analyze carbon and nitrogen isotopes, fossil pollen, diatoms, fungal spores, and charcoal in lake and swamp-sediment cores from East Africa. Understanding climate and vegetational change in East Africa is significant because it opens a window for studying the variability of tropical climate systems. This project will reconstruct East Africa's environment with the necessary time resolution and sufficient precision to reveal the causal mechanisms behind the climate changes during the last 10,000 years. An important scientific goal of the project is to investigate the interaction of human-induced impacts and the pattern of climate change in shaping East Africa's environment in the past. Specifically, the study seeks to answer the following questions: At what point during the the last 10,000 years does the evidence of human-induced impacts on the environment appear in the record? To what extent does variability in the solar cycle and long-distance climate events explain changes in East Africa's climate and environment through time? And lastly, does the human-induced imprint on the environment supplant natural climatic change trend in East Africa during the last 4,500 years? The project holds the promise of providing important data and a broader understanding of environmental change and its relation to climate, and provides a context for better understanding the interplay of humans and climate. The broader impacts of the project include supporting graduate students, contributing to local capacity building in Kenya, and international collaboration with scientists in Kenya through collaborative research and joint publications.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Discerning the dynamics of human-climate interaction remains one of humanity's eminent unanswered questions. This project aims to study the history of climate change, vegetational changes, and human impacts on tropical African environments during the Holocene through the examination of a multi-proxy record of the lithostratigraphy, fossil pollen, diatoms, fungal spores, and microscopic charcoal in lake-sediment cores. Geochemical, biological, and sedimentary records preserved in lacustrine and palustrine environments provide an excellent archive of past changes in the environment resulting from both climate changes and anthropogenic impacts which could reveal how the natural environment may respond to human-related climate change in the future. Understanding climate and vegetational change in East Africa is significant because it opens a window for studying variability in tropical climate systems and their causal mechanisms which, to date, remain largely unresolved. This project will use a multi-proxy approach to reconstruct East Africa's paleoenvironment with the necessary time resolution and sufficient precision to reveal the causal mechanisms behind the climate changes during the late Holocene through analysis of cores from Lake Kanyaboli (a satellite of Lake Victoria) and Saiwa Swamp in western Kenya. <br/><br/>The important goals of the project include: producing a high-temporal-resolution multi-proxy paleoenvironmental record of the late Holocene for the East African region based on analysis of sediment cores collected from lacustrine and palustrine environments; understanding the control mechanisms for the spatial and temporal variability of environmental changes in East Africa and their possible linkage to solar activity and teleconnection events; isolating human-induced changes in the East African landscapes from the changes due to climate variations by employing the multi-proxy approach involving geochemical species, pollen, mycological data, diatoms, and microscopic charcoal; and identifying and dating the onset of anthropogenic impacts on the environment and exploring their relationship with environmental changes in the tropical African region.<br/><br/>The scientific issues that will be investigated are interdisciplinary in nature and will address questions which are important to understanding the impacts of human activities on geophysical processes and paleoenvironmental change. The research holds the promise of providing important data and a broader understanding of environmental change and its relation to climate, and provides a context for better understanding the interplay of humans and climate.

The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Margaret Frank is, ""A role for long-distance RNA signaling in tomato via graft-induced vigor."" The host institution for the fellowship is the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Chitwood.<br/><br/>Increasing crop yield in the face of bad growing conditions, whether from pests and diseases or because it is too hot and dry, is a central problem in agriculture. Grafting, a technique that combines the shoots of one plant with the roots of another, has been used for over 2,000 years to bring together ideal combinations of roots and shoots, thus allowing plants to grow in sub-optimal conditions, increase yield, and improve crop quality. In tomato, shoots that are grafted onto hybrid roots (resulting from crossing different tomato species) show increased yield. This proposed research is to understand how roots communicate with shoots, and to find the genetic combinations of roots and shoots that act together to increase yield. Broader impacts include training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, the participation of the Fellow in career-building workshops, as well as the development of a teaching module that combines time-lapse imaging with community gardening for Saint Louis elementary schools that serve groups who are underrepresented in STEM fields. Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, quantitative genetics, and field phenotyping. <br/><br/>Although recent experimental evidence suggests that non-cell autonomous long-distance signals may play an important role in the mechanism through which grafting impacts plant growth and physiology, the precise connection between these signals and yield remains poorly understood, and even largely unexplored. In this project, this connection will be explored by conducting a series of experiments linking the physiological and architectural hallmarks of grafted tomato plants to the organ-specific molecular signatures of native as well non-cell autonomous graft-transmissible messenger RNA- and small RNA profiles. In parallel with traditional quantitative trait locus mapping of grafting-induced vigor, the data will be used to identify candidate genes that function in a non-cell autonomous manner to drive improvements in solanaceous crop performance. Discoveries from this research will be disseminated through presentations at top tier conferences, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and submission of data to the following public repositories: NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra), NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and the SOL Genomics Network (http://solgenomics.net/).

The common practice is to choose and transfer subsets of data from multiple data archive servers to local machines and then conduct data analysis tasks. However, this approach becomes increasingly unsustainable with an exponential growth of observation data size. It becomes an increasing severe problem that scientists can gain detailed observation data but lack suitable and scalable analysis capabilities to study the full extent of data.

The differential privacy community has explored private release of datasets, but this has largely been within the computer science theory community and has not rigorously evaluated the practical utility of the methods. This project develops techniques and tools to create synthetic ""surrogate datasets"" with the same structure and statistical properties as the original dataset, but satisfying differential privacy. The work includes development of techniques to generate synthetic data amenable to statistical analysis, evaluation of the techniques in real-life big data, and to develop and release as open source tools for dataset creation. This project brings a statistician's viewpoint to the utility question, and evaluates against both simulated data, the census record based ADULT dataset frequently used in anonymization studies, and two real datasets, one with hospital inpatient data and the other a social science study on poverty. The work is being featured in several community outreach programs to stimulate interests in STEM careers among K-12 students.<br/><br/>The project builds on multiple synthesis (generating multiple datasets from posterior distribution-derived sufficient statistics). The project is first establishing theoretical and methodological foundations, including but not limited to mathematical derivation of the global sensitivity of the sufficient statistics in commonly used statistical models, establishment of a theory that guarantees individual privacy protection in released data, and establishment of large-sample inferential theories on the synthetic data. Probability theory, stochastic process, asymptotic theory, Bayesian modelling and computing, and missing data analysis techniques are heavily employed. To ensure scalability to Big Data, sufficient statistics whose scalar components do not increase as the number of data items increases are being investigated. The developed method is evaluated by simulation studies and applications to real life data sets (including social/financial data and health care data) benchmarked against current methodologies for releasing individual-level data. Finally, open-source software is being developed for release on the Comprehensive R Archive Network that produces a synthetic dataset matching the schema of the original data, as well as certain statistics to explain disclosure risk and support analysis of data utility.","indigo"

The initial invasion of a novel pathogen into a susceptible host population can cause a disease outbreak resulting in high levels of mortality and declines in population size. When this happens, natural selection can occur on both the host and pathogen populations during the disease outbreak. This can result in evolutionary changes in the host's susceptibility and tolerance to infection by the pathogen. It can also change the pathogen's ability to damage the host (virulence). These changes can in turn determine whether the host population can persist and recover from the disease. Understanding these evolutionary processes is crucial in development of conservation strategies for threatened species. This project will examine these processes for the case of a fungal pathogen that causes the disease Chytridiomycosis in frogs and salamanders. This disease has had catastrophic effects on amphibians worldwide, with numerous species extinctions documented in recent decades and many more species at risk. The researchers will investigate the patterns of evolutionary change in both the pathogen and the host (mountain yellow-legged frogs), following the invasion of the disease into hundreds of high elevation lakes in the California Sierra Nevada. This project will contribute to the understanding of the role of infectious diseases, such as Chytridiomycosis, as agents of evolutionary change in natural populations. It will provide critical information to state and federal agencies. It will also train and educate numerous, undergraduates and graduate students as well as the general public. <br/><br/>This research builds on data from a long-term study of the population dynamics of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana sierrae and Rana muscosa) in the complex landscape of the California Sierra Nevada, and the impacts of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), as it has invaded and spread through hundreds of frog populations. In most cases, invasion of Bd results in outbreaks of the disease Chytridiomycosis, rapid frog population declines, and local extinctions. In some cases however long-term persistence of frog populations occurs with Bd in an enzootic state in which the impact of the pathogen is greatly reduced. The research will make use of recent advances in molecular approaches, and the extensive dataset and archive of samples from the R. sierrae/R. muscosa - Bd system, to investigate how populations of both host and pathogen change during the transition from pre-pathogen arrival, to disease outbreak, to enzootic disease, to potential recovery of the pre-disease host population abundances. This dataset will be used to investigate the genetic basis for differences in host resistance/tolerance and pathogen virulence. Cutting-edge genomic analysis of existing swab samples will be combined with continued surveys of field populations to identify new disease outbreaks and describe the transition from outbreak to enzootic state, collection of Bd cultures and frog mucosal samples from field populations, and laboratory experiments on Bd virulence and frog","salmon"

Information about growth and development is encoded in a plant's DNA, which has four fundamental chemical components, often referred to as A, C, G and T. However, the C can also be modified by a process called methylation, which allows it to function as a 5th information component in DNA. While it is apparent that methylated Cs play an important role in plant growth and development, their role has yet to be fully understood. In this proposal, the number and pattern of methylated Cs among different crop plants will be compared, including barley, einkorn wheat and sorghum. These comparisons will be used to investigate the influence of methylated Cs on the function of genes. The overall goal is to better understand the contribution of methylated Cs to plant growth and development, so that eventually this information can be used for crop improvement.<br/><br/>DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic modifications that are crucial to plant genome function. Recent work has also shown that methylation has broad consequences for genome evolution, including the composition of intergenic DNA, as a fundamental evolutionary property of specific genes, and as a driver of compositional biases among genomic regions. Given the importance of epigenetic mechanisms, a thorough understanding of the evolution and function of plant genomes requires characterization of epigenetic variation among plant species. Yet, such a characterization is presently lacking. This project will generate and analyze whole genome bisulfite sequencing (BSseq) and transcript (RNAseq) data for an array of grass species. The data will be released to the Short Read Archive and Gene Expression Omnibus databases prior to publication. The goal is to use the data to better understand the relationship among DNA methylation, gene evolution and gene function, as measured by gene expression. To achieve this end, a series of unique evolutionary analyses will be developed that will address three specific hypotheses: 1) that gene-body methylation is a conserved feature of functionally important genes and maintained over evolutionary time by natural selection; 2) that evolutionary shifts in gene body methylation (and/or the methylation of flanking regions) drive shifts in gene expression between species; and 3) that DNA methylation variation among tissues - specifically in genes and flanking regions - contributes to tissue-specific gene expression.","teal"

In particular, climate model simulations suggest that the westerly jet streams found at upper levels in the middle latitudes will shift towards the poles, so that the mean Northern Hemisphere jet stream will migrate northward, with a corresponding southward shift for its the Southern Hemisphere counterpart. These shifts are small but consequential, as patterns of rainfall and storminess in the middle latitudes are determined in large part by the positions of the jet streams. <br/><br/>The poleward shift of jet streams as a consequence of greenhouse warming is a robust feature of global warming simulations and has been a research topic since at least 2005, but the seasonality and geography of the response has not yet been fully explored. Preliminary work for this project shows that in the Southern Hemisphere the largest shift is in the Fall (March to May), followed by Summer (December to February), Winter (June to August), and Spring (September to November). In the North Atlantic the order is, from largest to smallest, Fall (September to November), Summer (June to August), Spring (March to May), and Winter (December to February). The ordering is again different in the North Pacific, with Fall leading by a large margin followed by Winter, Spring, and Summer. By now several theories have been proposed to explain why the jets shift poleward in an year-round, longitudinally averaged sense, but none of these theories provides a clear intuition for the seasonality (i.e. why the shift is largest in Fall) or the regional variations. <br/><br/>Research under this award consists of analysis of observational data from reanalysis products and simulations of future climate from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project and the Large Ensemble archive of simulations using the Community Earth System Model. This analysis is followed by numerical experiments using models of varying levels of complexity, intended to isolate and study possibly physical mechanisms leading seasonally and geographically varying jet shifts. One issue to be considered is that the pattern of greenhouse warming generally includes a deep tropospheric warming maximum in the tropics together with surface trapped warming near the poles (referred to as polar amplification). The jet shifts can be regarded as a combined response to the tropical and polar influences, which are likely to have opposing effects and very different seasonalities.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest due to the strong impacts of jet shifts on local climate, for instance a northward shift of jet streams could cause drying in the region downwind of the present-day jet location accompanied by excessive rain and snow to the north. In addition, the project will support and train two students, thereby contributing to the future workforce in this research area. The PI and her students will also organize a special session at an annual geosciences meeting to publicize results of the study and encourage further investigation of the topic.","fuchsia"

Many of these changes were first observed and studied using data from the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP), which maintains at least 100 buoys in the Arctic Ocean that collect data on surface water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice motion. These data are analyzed and made available to the research community by the United States IABP. IABP data were fundamental in demonstrating that atmospheric pressure has decreased, air temperature has increased, and the clockwise circulation of current and ice in the Arctic Ocean has weakened in recent decades. The integrated effect of all these changes contributed to the precipitous decrease in the average age (thickness) of sea ice observed during this period. The data help us understand the recent record low summer sea ice extents. The project will continue the United States interagency Arctic buoy program which began collecting data in 1979 and provide critical atmospheric, ice, and surface ocean measurements that cannot be obtained by other means. The project also has a multifaceted outreach program to share science with the public that includes the principal investigator participating in programs such as the Polar Science Weekend, public presentations, K-12 school visits, and public communication through interactions with journalists. <br/><br/>The observations from the IABP have been essential for: 1) monitoring Arctic and global climate change, 2) forecasting weather and sea ice conditions, 3) forcing, assimilation, and validation of global weather and climate models and, 4) validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, sea ice thickness, etc. Our ability to predict weather and sea ice conditions requires in situ observations of surface meteorology and ice motion. These observations are assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction models that are used to forecast weather on synoptic time scales, e.g. by the National Weather Service; and into the many long-term atmospheric re-analyses (e.g. National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research re-analysis) that are used for innumerable climate studies. Based on a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences in 1974, the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program was established by the Pacific Science Center/Applied Physics laboratory, University of Washington, in 1978 to support the Global Weather Experiment. The program continued through 1990 under funding from various agencies. In 1991, the IABP succeeded the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program, but the basic objective remains unchanged: maintaining a network of drifting buoys on the Arctic Ocean to provide meteorological and oceanographic data for real-time operational requirements and research purposes including support to the World Climate Research Program, the World Weather Watch Program, and the Arctic Observing Network. The project will collect data from all Arctic buoys, analyze, disseminate, and archive all IABP data, and maintain historical data bases.","plum"

In order to improve predictions that enable us to anticipate and plan for future change in ice cover on seasonal to decadal time scales, we need to understand the processes driving the observed change. An area of particular interest is the temperature-driven mass balance of the ice cover. The mass balance is the balance between the amount of ice growth in the winter and the amount of melt in the summer. Mass balance is a key climate change indicator since it combines the impact of heating and cooling at the top and bottom of the ice. If there is net warming over time, then there will be thinning of the ice. Conversely, net cooling leads to thicker ice. The objective of our project is to contribute to the Arctic Observing Network by maintaining a network of autonomous ice mass balance (IMB) buoys, installed in the drift ice of the Arctic Ocean. The observations from these buoys enable us to explore what changes in sea ice thickness are taking place and how these changes occur, thereby improving our understanding of this complex and important component of the global environment. Broader Impacts include contributing to Dartmouth College?s Women in Science Program and an ?adopt a buoy? program for middle school students. <br/><br/>The primary objectives of our project are to: 1) procure and deploy a minimum of 5 IMB buoys per year, to increase network coverage, and 2) process and archive the data from these buoys to ensure that they are fully, freely, openly, and immediately accessible to all researchers and interested users. A key to achieving the first objective is an advancement in buoy technology, creating a version of the IMB that costs less to produce, is easier to deploy, and is designed for deployment in the increasingly prevalent seasonal sea ice cover. We will continue to strategically deploy the IMBs in coordination with complementary atmospheric and oceanographic instruments to optimize the observations throughout the Arctic Ocean. We will also continue to build on our strong national and international collaborations, to maximize the extent of the IMB network across the Arctic Basin and to minimize the logistic costs associated with deployment. The end result will be an integrated atmosphere-ice-ocean observing array providing a comprehensive description of the response of the ice cover to atmospheric and oceanic forcing.","plum"

The infusion or transport of large-bodied copepods, whose life cycle includes diapauses (hibernation) at subsurface depths, into the upwelling area off Oman is fundamental to the success of the pelagic ecosystem in the region. Changes in the SW Monsoon wind pattern or strength can alter timing and intensity of upwelling and mixing, presenting the possibility that primary productivity during upwelling (dominated by diatoms) and the large-bodied, diapausing copepods that ingest phytoplankton, may become de-coupled. When decoupling has happened in other ecosystems, populations crash forcing a food web reorganization, often with outcomes that are undesirable. In the case of Oman, the abundant myctophid fish, a key link to upper trophic level fish of commercial importance, may be at risk for a significant population decline because of changes in the timing of primary production.<br/><br/>Now that climate change may be altering the monsoon cycle of wind forcing in the Arabian Sea, there exists the possibility that the life cycle of diapausing C. carinatus may become mismatched with the appearance of their food supply occurring during the upwelling season. While ontogenetic migration is generally associated with high latitude environments, where the spring bloom of phytoplankton driven by the annual cycle of sunlight provides a spatially and temporally reliable food supply, there are no other copepods inhabiting the tropics and subtropics that have diapause at depth in their life cycle (except perhaps Subeucalanus crassus in the Arabian Sea). Understanding the cues that trigger downward migration of C. carinatus at the end of the upwelling season, and investigating whether S. crassus has a phenology similar to C. carinatus, are the goals of this project. An international archive of samples from the Arabian Sea extending back to 1992, as well as new samples, will be used in this study.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. Collaboration will continue with the Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman. The university is just 26 years old, and marine science in Oman is not much older in spite of the fact Oman has 1700 miles of coastline bordering the Sea/Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. These collaborative efforts will extend times series observations that began six years ago off Masirah Island (located in the seasonal upwelling zone) with a goal of introducing Omanis to the value of sustained measurements in their coastal waters. There have been important successes, especially with the Beduin fishermen on Masirah Island, who have known their local waters for a lifetime, and recognize that dramatic changes are happening now. They are eager participants in the ""knowledge gathering"" such as making daily measurements of sea surface temperature. As fish kills and red tides proliferate in the coastal waters of Oman, and costly cyclones impact the coast with greater frequency, the value of sustained observations has become appreciated. In addition, the PI has recently co-authored two books on Arabian Sea plankton taxonomy and two more volumes are expected to result from the research.","lavender"

Craig Venter Institute), Joann Mudge (National Center for Genome Resources) <br/><br/>This project uses functional assays, de novo genome assembly and bioinformatic data-mining to characterize symbiosis genes in the model legume Medicago truncatula. Legumes are noteworthy for the sophisticated symbioses they form with rhizobial bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, existing knowledge about symbioses comes primarily from knockout mutants, an approach that often misses genes of subtle yet significant effect, especially genes likely to be important in contemporary evolution. In earlier work, several strongly supported candidate symbiosis loci were discovered through genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) and support for candidate genes often included independent evidence like expression profile, correlation with multiple traits or co-localization with known symbiotic phenotypes. The current project will test ~100 of these candidate loci through reverse genetic experiments involving Tnt1 insertion and RNAi ""knockdown"" plant lines. Promising genes will be examined through interaction assays involving previously defined Sinorhizobium and AM strains and tested for ""gene-for-gene"" relationships using a panel of 48 sequenced Sinorhizobium strains. Earlier GWAS mapping only targeted SNP variation, even though structural variants (SVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) are known to have major impacts on genome variation. This is especially relevant to the genomics of symbiosis because the large gene families such as the NB-ARC domain-containing genes and nodule cysteine rich peptides (NCRs) play critical roles in symbiosis. This project will deeply sequence and de novo assemble 30 nodal M. truncatula accessions, in order to discover SVs and CNVs. SVs and CNVs will be imputed genome-wide, leading to a new round of GWAS to discover symbiotic loci missed in the earlier phase of mapping. The primary outcomes of this project will be the identification of genes associated with the contemporary evolution of symbiosis as well as the architecture of M. truncatula genomic diversity. <br/><br/>This research effort will be extended by involving undergraduates from Hamline University, a four year institution located near the University of Minnesota, and from the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). Students at Hamline will work throughout the academic year and then together with UPR students during the summer as part of Minnesota's Life Sciences Summer Undergraduate Research Program (LSSURP) program. Their work will target the important but largely uncharacterized Sinorhizobial enzyme, ACC deaminase, and students will also participate in the screening of reverse genetic mutants. These experiences will provide the students the opportunity to develop their own hypothesis-driven projects. Through joint mentoring by project PIs, student training will also assist the undergraduate research program at Hamline to become more competitive for its own future external research initiatives. Genomic sequence resources will be available for public through medicagohapmap.org, and the Short Read Archive, dbSNP and FTP sites at Genbank. Importantly, the underlying Medicago Hapmap GWAS platform, available at medicagohapmap.org, will provide a long-term resource for the broader research community to discover legume genes controlling quantitative variation of agricultural and biological interest, especially trait variation in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the fourth most widely cultivated crop in the U.S.","teal"

This coordination is accomplished through an intricate interplay between the light signaling, circadian clock, and hormone signaling networks. However, the manner in which these networks interact to control plant growth is poorly understood. This project exploits the robust ability of sunflower to track the sun to characterize pathways that coordinate plant growth with daily environmental fluctuations. First, developmental and environmental factors that control solar tracking will be defined. Next, high-throughput analysis of hormone and gene transcript levels in different portions of solar tracking stems will be carried out, allowing the identification of candidate genes and pathways controlling these growth rhythms. Finally, genome-enabled association and linkage mapping techniques will take advantage of the abundant natural variation present in common sunflower and its wild relatives to provide essential information about the role of solar tracking in plant adaptation to the environment. Together, these studies will elucidate the interactions between diverse signaling networks that optimize plant growth with environmental changes and provide insights into ways to improve plant performance.<br/><br/>Plant yield is enhanced by daily growth patterns of stems and leaves that allow more efficient photosynthesis and higher water use efficiency. Although a number of molecular pathways that regulate plant growth have been identified, an understanding of how they are coordinated with each other and with environmental cues remains elusive. Solar tracking in sunflower is an extremely appropriate trait for addressing these basic questions since it provides a unique entry point to determine how internal and external cues regulate growth across a single organ. By asking fundamental questions about how this coordination occurs and evolves, these studies will reveal important insights into how to enhance crop plant performance and conserve plant diversity in the face of global climate change and an increasing human population. In addition, this project will generate extensive resources that will be useful to the entire Compositae community. To provide public access to these resources, transcriptome and functionally annotated marker data will be deposited in public databases including the NCBI Short Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/), the Compositae Genome Project (http://compgenomics.ucdavis.edu/), the Sunflower Genome Resources Consortium (http://www.sunflowergenome.org), and DRYAD (http://datadryad.org/). Germplasm will be deposited with the National Plant Germplasm System (http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/).

Donovan Bailey (New Mexico State University - Las Cruces)<br/><br/>Senior Collaborator - Colin Hughes (Zurich Botanical Garden)<br/><br/>The extensive application of next generation sequencing in agricultural research has focused on yield improvements in the most important global food crops (e.g., corn, wheat, rice, and soybean). However, lesser-known crops in tropical systems are also of tremendous significance; yet these receive comparatively little research attention. Several such plant groups are broadly known as ""multipurpose crops"", often representing key elements in sustainable agriculture that are fundamental to production gains in mainstream crops grown in impoverished regions. One such lesser-known system includes members of the genus Leucaena, which comprises 24 nitrogen-fixing species of small trees and shrubs. The unusually high leaf protein content of Leucaena (particularly L. leucocephala) helped to garner the titles ""miracle tree"" and ""alfalfa of the tropics"" and resulted in small- and large-scale plantings reaching 5 million lowland tropical hectares by the late 1980s. These introduced plantations provide: 1) unique protein-rich leaves for animal feed in livestock production systems, 2) green manure used as nitrogen-rich fertilizer for crops and for soil stabilization in alley-cropping systems, and 3) rapidly renewable woody biomass for construction, fuelwood, and even biofuels through lignocellulosic precursors. The goal of this project is to investigate how plant transcriptomes change through time and in association with diversification of species. Specifically, a cost- effective and phylogenetically informed approach will be used to sequence, assemble, and compare sets of expressed genes (transcriptomes) from all species of Leucaena. Insect feeding trials will be used to identify genes and broad metabolic pathways associated with psyllid insect resistance and susceptibility among different species of Leucaena. In addition, the project will use the data generated to investigate broad patterns of transcriptome size variation and identify some of the specific changes that have been associated with speciation through geographic isolation in comparison to hybrid speciation associated with genome duplication (allopolyploidy). Finally the data generated will be used to develop molecular markers for plant breeding and other studies.<br/><br/>Newly developed breeding tools for tropical woody species are critical for future widespread use as contributors to sustainable agriculture in poor tropical regions of the world. NMSU is a minority serving university with existing programs successfully attracting underrepresented individuals to careers in scientific research. Furthermore, this project includes the implementation of a new course and undergraduate laboratories developed to advance interest and the understanding of plant genome research among students at a Hispanic Serving Institution using a plant system of interest to Mesoamerican culture and heritage. Support of this MCA-PGR project will provide extensive training and mentoring for the PI, associated postdoctoral fellow and graduate student who will work closely with a primary investigator applying new genomics technologies to address these research questions.

The contributions of long-term observations to our understanding of how the ocean works are numerous and far-reaching. Yet, such studies are exceedingly rare- especially those with a biogeochemical and deep ocean focus. <br/><br/>Since 1978, the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP), originally founded and managed by at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and now managed by the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS), has continuously measured particle fluxes in the deep Sargasso Sea. The 34+ year OFP time-series is, by far, the longest of its kind and unique in its focus on the deep ocean. OFP has produced a unique, albeit ""edited"", record of temporal variability in the ""biological pump"", a term loosely applied here to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The OFP provided the first direct evidence for seasonality in the deep ocean and the tight coupling between deep fluxes and upper ocean processes. It has provided clear evidence of the intensity of biological reprocessing of flux and scavenging of suspended material in mesopelagic waters. The record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses. <br/><br/>This award will provide three more years of funding for this unique and fundamental oceanographic time-series. As the record lengthens, we are better able to put into perspective the observed flux patterns in terms of the interplay between climate and ocean functioning. The colocation of complementary research programs at the Bermuda Time-Series Site: the OFP, the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series (BATS), the Bermuda Testbed Mooring (BTM, 1994-2007), as well as new advances in ship-based, moored and autonomous observational capabilities at the site present unparalleled opportunities to study the coupled interactions among ocean physics, biology and chemistry and material fluxes, and how these in turn are linked to atmospheric and climatic forcing. New information about ocean biogeochemistry, preserved as chemical signals in recovered flux materials, continues to be revealed as ever more sophisticated analytical research tools are applied. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: (1) Systematic, long-term biogeochemical observations, such as those provided by the OFP, are essential to gain an understanding of natural oceanic variability and to provide a reference point in which to interpret the repercussions of possible future climate change scenarios. (2) Previous NSF review panels have recognized the OFP as an invaluable ""community resource"". The OFP will continue to share its resources- sample material, data, ancillary ship time, and use of the mooring platform- with researchers and students to make possible a diverse range of investigations at a very low cost to the community. (3) The OFP sample archive is a rare treasure. The sample material to be collected will continue to be invaluable for current and future biogeochemical and climate research. (4) Educational experiences provided by the OFP broaden the research experiences and science directions of many young students and early investigators at critical junctures in their careers. Of particular value are opportunities to become directly involved with observational oceanography, time-series research and integrated ship- and mooring-based research activities occurring at the Bermuda Time Series site","lavender"

The COMSES (COmputational Modeling for SocioEcological Science) network aims to be broadly inclusive of social and natural scientists using (and desiring to use) advanced modeling to study coupled natural and human, or 'socioecological systems' (SES). <br/><br/>The often non-linear, non-intuitive, and even surprising relationships and consequences that emerge from complex interactions between human social practice and the biophysical environment make it imperative that scientific models - including their underlying assumptions, algorithmic processes, logical consistency, and connections with empirical data - be transparent and quantitative. For this reason, computational modeling in general and agent-based modeling (ABM) in particular are important tools for research in socioecological sciences. Yet ABM remains little used or understood in the broader scientific communities involved in the science of coupled natural and human systems. Rather, it is widely perceived as inaccessible to social and natural scientists in spite of the fact that ABM has existed as a potential research tool for nearly two decades. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the COMSES network is to serve as a coordinated community of practice and a conduit to expedite knowledge exchange for computational modeling in SES. The network will build on the NSF-funded OpenABM Consortium http://www.openabm.org. It will seek to grow scientific infrastructure so as to better serve research that uses computational modeling by:<br/><br/>- establishing an interactive, online archive for computational models and providing standard tools and data for model evaluation;<br/>- promoting a common standard for describing models;<br/>- developing educational curricula for embedding modeling and computational thinking in the interdisciplinary study of social and natural sciences.<br/>- establishing a new e-journal dedicated to publishing research in the social and natural sciences that involves computational modeling, and studies of modeling methods and empirical evaluation.<br/><br/>Through the development of exemplar curricula and training opportunities, the project will endeavor to stimulate new interdisciplinary learning opportunities for students at multiple levels who represent the next generation of scientists. With the ever-increasing importance of information technology and related cybertools in today's world, training in advanced modeling techniques and their application in the social sciences will broadly benefit students' careers. <br/><br/>Many of the environmental challenges that we face in the 21st century may also be considered social problems because they affect our quality of life and can only be addressed by human actions. The COMSES network has the potential to transform the social and natural sciences in profound ways by developing computational tools and expertise that will help us to gain a much deeper understanding of the relationships between humans and their environment, and allow us to better predict the likely effects of future policies and decisions.","khaki"

The program is in support of CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. These advances continue to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. A joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is helping to identify critical areas where potential changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean?s transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers (CFCs, SF6, tritium/3He). This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data. Post-cruise data updates, distribution, and archive will continue to be managed by groups with separate funding. This ongoing project is integrated with a larger international effort to monitor the ocean's response to climate change.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The results will be disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community, and are available to the community at large rather than being proprietary for the investigators involved in the project. The data policy is stringent and geared towards rapid and open dissemination, with a clear structure for all data to undergo thorough quality control and transmission to a recognized data center. This ambitious degree of openness has resulted in rapid and widespread availability and use of the data. The project benefits to society include the collection of a high quality data set, and use of the data to assess climate change. The global program provides full water column data of climatically significant parameters with decadal coverage. These data are and will be used to assess climate change by quantifying the uptake and storage of anthropogenic CO2 by the ocean, and contributing to an understanding and models of the processes that control the uptake and transport of CO2 into the ocean's interior. Since these are likely to be the only systematic observations below 2000 m, they are and will be used to document long term trends in ocean warming, and heat and freshwater fluxes. The data will remain a resource for model calibration of the climate system. The project will continue to promote training and learning.

The sediments provide a record of past climate, ocean circulation, and ice sheet history, and were recovered at great cost using piston cores deployed from research vessels and rotary coring from drilling platforms. The funding supports a curator, an assistant curator, and a student work force from FSU. This staff supports visiting scientists, manages the collections and the equipment used for core characterization and sampling, and maintain data bases. The AMGRF houses a unique collection of sediment cores from the Southern Oceans and has served in this role for the past 50 years. <br/><br/><br/>The Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility (AMGRF) at Florida State University, the NSF repository of Southern Ocean piston- and drill-cores, has been conducting marine geological research and providing numerous services to the Antarctic and Earth Science Community in its present building for the past 50 years. This proposal requests operating funds to (a) continue provide these services, (b) manage archives and databases, (c) complete necessary upgrades of the AMGRF Cold-Room, and (d) continue our education and outreach programs for students and the general public. The AMGRF archives and curates more than 23,000 m of cored sediment (over 7,000 cores) collected by United States Antarctic Program (USAP) vessels. The Facility also archives and curates some 5,500 m of rotary-cored material from international programs such as ANDRILL. The standard core processing services include core splitting, Multi-Sensor Track analyses, core photography, whole-core x-rays, etc., core description publications (macroscopic and microscopic), and core sampling. Facility personnel also provide curatorial support services to field-based projects upon request. Analytical equipment at the AMGRF serves the research needs of Facility personnel (for the generation of detailed core descriptions), NSF Principal Investigators involved with the United States Antarctic Program (USAP), and qualified users from the scientific community in the U.S. and beyond. This equipment provides users of the Facility with the necessary tools to rapidly and objectively analyze the piston cores and drill cores sent to the Facility each year. The AMGRF maintains a core and sample database with the latest map-sample search capabilities that can be accessed through the continuously upgraded Facility website. This searchable database contains basic information about all the cores stored at the facility, as well as information on samples taken from 1964 to the present. In addition to the sediment core archives the AMGRF also keeps archives of ship and deck-logs, a collection of ca. 862,000 microscope slides, and a library of AMGRF related publications. Facility personnel routinely provide tours and lectures for students and the general public.","plum"

Although punitive policies may reduce the base-rate of ethical violations, they may paradoxically increase major ethical infractions by discouraging employees' willingness to report violations. This phenomenon is referred to as confessional reluctance, defined as the resistance to disclosing ethical violations to peers and supervisors. Confessional reluctance could turn minor ethical violations into major ethical catastrophes, as organization members seek to cover-up their mistakes through deception, falsification of records, and other means. This research project will examine confessional reluctance across several studies with multiple methods, including archival, experimental and a real-world field study. This research is important because understanding and preventing organizational ethical catastrophes is essential to a functioning society. Ethical breaches take economic and social tolls among the general public, corporations and governments. By identifying a new way of understanding major ethical breaches, our research will suggest actionable strategies for decreasing them, including employee selection, improving work-team functioning, and implementing more proactive organizational ethical climates. Ultimately, this research will provide a straightforward and empirically-backed method for making organizations more ethical.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project proposes a multilevel model linking punitive ethical climates, confessional reluctance and unethical escalation, and test it through archival, field and experimental studies. To better understand confessional reluctance - and to enable interventions to reduce it - this research also identify learning climate, team/lead-member exchange and prosocial motivation as key moderators of the punitiveness-confessional reluctance relationship. Study 1 provides preliminary evidence for confessional reluctance and its link to punitive ethical climates through an online survey. Studies 2, 3 and 4 examine the link between confessional reluctance, punitive ethical climate and the escalation of unethical behavior through experimental studies. Study 4 uses company annual reports to examine the link between punitive policies and major ethical infractions, and Study 5 provides a longitudinal test of the model in the field. This research extends the literature by combining organizational variables (i.e., climate) and individual variables (i.e., prosocial motivation) into a multilevel framework. Our approach harnesses the complementary strengths of different methodologies, including the control of the lab, the realism of archival studies, and the generalizability of field samples. The lab studies provide rigorous manipulations of punitive climate with realistic simulations of organizational behavior and behavioral measures of ethical violations and confessional reluctance. The archival study extends our model to a range of companies, and the longitudinal field study examines our full model across branches of a corporation. Our interdisciplinary approach uses the tools of organizational behavior and experimental social psychology to extend our understanding of ethical behavior. Our model is particularly transformative because it contradicts basic intuitions about management. An understandable reaction to ethical breaches is to make an ethical climate more punitive, but this can paradoxically make major ethical violations more likely. Therefore, this research suggests a concrete intervention for making organizations more ethical.","crimson"

The majority of archaeological investigations in Yucatï¿½n, Mï¿½xico have highlighted Pre-Columbian Maya sites and Colonial haciendas. By contrast the relationships between indigenous landowners (caciques) and their subject populations on sites of more modest architectural scale, such as ranchos, has been understudied from an archaeological perspective. Morgan-Smith's research examines landowner-laborer relationships among Maya-speakers on the cusp of historical political shifts, addressing the critical issue of how socioeconomic status and tenancy on indigenous-owned landed estates factor into household abandonment, and relationships with sites of oppression in the present. The processes involved in landowner-worker interactions continue in many regions of the world today and this research thus has current relevance. Within this context, this research addresses the following broader questions: How are social and economic relationships between the landowners and laborers materialized in household contexts? How do differential patterns of tenancy and inequality inform the understanding of debt peonage on indigenous-owned landed estates? The proposed research is designed to address gaps in the current literature on household abandonment and the nascent field of Yucatec historical archaeology using a mixed-methods approach.<br/><br/>Morgan-Smith's archaeological research explores the material expression of household abandonment from Rancho Kiuic, a rural 18th- 20th century landed estate in the Puuc region of Yucatï¿½n, Mï¿½xico. Occupied by generations of Maya-speaking landowners and laborers through the late-Colonial and Republican eras. The Rancho represents a site type with that has seen little archaeological or ethnohistoric investigation. Using household-level excavation data, oral histories of the descendant community, and archival research, this project examines the relationships between the Rancho?s owners and the laboring population through house-lot abandonment contexts. Archaeological excavation will establish occupation lengths within, and material inequities between, house-lots of the landowning and laboring families. Oral history interviews and archival research will be employed to identify resources, opportunities, and historical processes that may have drawn the population to or away from the Rancho. Using network analysis, the resulting archaeological, archival, and oral history data will be evaluated to understand how complex socioeconomic relationships impacted decisions to leave the community, produced the material manifestations of household abandonment, and continue to shape the descendants? interactions with the landscape today. The advantage of this approach is that it gives the oral history and archival data ? which are often treated as parallel or comparative in historical archaeology - the analytical consideration of material data sets. At the same time, this project furthers ongoing collaborative relationships with the descendant community Xobenhaltun, of Rancho Kiuic, who maintain their ties through use of the site's cemetery. Specifically, community members will participate in the project as consultants and contributors to histories of their experiences at Rancho Kiuic. Involving the descendant community in dialogue about their pasts in their native language permits more meaningful engagement with communities in the archaeological process. Furthermore, this research provides field, lab, and oral history training for both graduate and undergraduate Anthropology student volunteers.","maroon"

Regarded as a defining moment in the organization of criminal justice and criminological science due to its creation of federal institutions to fund criminal justice research, other contributions of the commission have been less appreciated, including its impact on criminal justice education by creating a disciplinary field of criminal justice distinct from sociology and its use of systems analysis to create models of the criminal justice process as an integrated system whose varied components were coordinated towards the common goal of crime control. This project will conduct the first sustained analysis of the Crime Commission, investigating how diverse visions of crime prevention and criminal justice were introduced, negotiated, packaged, and enacted over the course of the commission and by other groups in its immediate aftermath; how knowledge production was shaped through organizational dynamics between commissioners and the staff of the commissions nine task force panels; and the specific impact of the Science and Technology Task Force, which brought systems analysis to the field of ""civil defense"" and the ""war on crime."" <br/><br/>The project's focus on science and technology provides a nuanced challenge to interpretations of the commission as extending Great Society agendas in uncomplicated ways. It explores how initial commission concerns with poverty and social causation dropped out of the commission's mappings and models of the criminal justice process, anticipating and shaping subsequent approaches and policy, and helps illuminate the subsequent extension of criminal justice technologies into everyday life. The analysis of extensive transcripts of meetings spanning a sixteenth month period adds to our understanding of the construction of scientific advisory reports, showing how diverse understandings of scientific aims and political interests are negotiated and packaged for perceived audiences. The project also serves as the last opportunity to preserve the memories and contemporary evaluations of justice practices by commission staff whose careers that began with the possibilities of the Crime Commission and witnessed unprecedented transformations in criminal justice practices. <br/><br/>The project is based in the empirical collection and analysis of three types of data. First, the study will use the tools of contemporary science studies to engage in a careful textual analysis of the public documents of the crime commission, interpreting these technical reports as public performances through which scientific credibility is communicated and maintained. Second, the analysis of official accounts will be complemented by the analysis of internal accounts collected at NARA sites and related collections. The archives are believed to contain a variety of relevant documents, including transcripts from commission meetings, notes from advisory panels, internal letters and memoranda, drafts of reports, and early maps and models of the criminal justice process. Both the public documents and internal documents will be coded using similar coding mechanisms enabling larger themes and developments to emerge. Third, the investigator will seek to contact and conduct audiotaped or videotaped interviews of all available staff connected with the commission. The goal of these interviews is to collect general perspectives of recollected operations, aspirations, and tensions within the crime commission across multiple organizational roles and standpoints, which can be cross-referenced with archival documents and other interviews. The investigator will also seek to record and gain participants' insights into previously unrecognized connections between the systems model being set forth and the subsequent development of criminal justice and criminology, as well as their interpretation and evaluation of later developments.<br/><br/>The project will design an interactive website designed for classroom use. The site will use techniques of science and technology studies to translate the project's central themes concerning science and the origins of the criminal justice system. At a time of heightened interest and criticism of US policies of mass incarceration and institutionalized criminal justice responses to racial inequality and popular protest, the project and website serves as an important ""history of the present"" that contextualizes how contemporary configurations of criminological science and criminal justice practices emerged and illuminates alternative paths not taken. The study also trains a team of undergraduates in archival research, the organization and analysis of primary source documents, and the development and presentation of research at professional meetings.","crimson"

The investigators believe that religious ritual and shared beliefs can play a role in this process as throughout history religious rituals have been documented occurring alongside such development. This research has current day relevance given the importance of religion as both an integrative and divisive force as evidenced in much of the developing world.<br/>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Neill Wallis and Dr. John Krigbaum will investigate the development, spread, and impact of extensive religious rituals among Florida populations ca. A.D. 200 to 600 using a variety of analytical tools and archival research. The mortuary practices of this Middle Woodland period, referred to as ""Weeden Island"", show widespread and conspicuous uniformity that is characteristic of a religious movement. The proliferation of these practices was apparently coincident with increasingly integrated social networks and emergent high status for some individuals. Given these associations, the project examines the role of Weeden Island rituality in the initiation of emergent social inequality through investigation of human diet, mobility, social interaction, and community formation. In the context of conspicuous religious parity, this research endeavors to identify exactly how disparate communities interacted with one another, how integrated they were, and how these trends inflected social and political histories in the region. <br/>Drawing on collections and archived field notes from 13 Middle Woodland mound sites distributed across peninsular Florida and curated at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH), this research will integrate (1) multiple lines of isotopic analysis of skeletal populations to generate data pertaining to diet and mobility, (2) osteological analysis to collect basic demographic and life history information on individual interments, (3) geochemical and petrographic analysis on Weeden Island mortuary wares to determine their ultimate provenance, and (4) technofunctional analysis to outline form and function of vessels and the potential for craft specialization. In addition, the uniformity of Weeden Island ritual practices will be evaluated through investigation of archived notes. These data and the correlation of variables will reveal specific historical trends in the practice and spread of Weeden Island rituality and its sociopolitical implications. <br/>The broader impacts of the study include contributions to archaeological method and social theory, the training of students, and public outreach and education. In terms of method, the analytical protocol builds on established techniques and combines them in innovative ways. These data lend a rare multidimensional robustness to the investigation of the complex region-wide phenomenon of Weeden Island, permitting more nuanced and potentially transformative understandings of the movement and life histories of Middle Woodland people and objects. At a theoretical level, through its focus on mobility and intergroup interactions, the project redirects the search for causes of social inequality toward a historical investigation of the process of community formation at regional scales, and has anthropological implications for explaining the intersections of religion, identity, and political conflict. <br/>The project provides advanced training and research experience for at least two Ph.D. students and several undergraduate museum and laboratory interns, and will form the basis for Ph.D. dissertations, and M.A. and honors theses. Results will be disseminated broadly and showcased through an Explore Research exhibit at the FLMNH and a companion website.

The image processing, statistical, and informatics tools to effectively and efficiently use big data imaging archives for quantitative population-level research and personalized medicine do not yet exist. This research will enable discovery science on a scale considerably larger than routinely possible with traditional study designs by creating novel informatics resources that tie archives of 3-D images into accessible research databases. This research will discover genetic and environmental factors that influence an individual's brain development and characterize the developing human brain through personal developmental trajectories. To accomplish this goal, new informatics technologies will be created to enable (1) image processing and segmentation based on image content in the context of heterogeneous, low quality, and error prone data with minimal human oversight and (2) routine archival, query, and image processing of large medical imaging datasets. This research will impact the areas of (1) informatics via novel computation models, (2) neuroscience via a new structural model of brain development, and (3) public health via newly accessible data sets for research. The science and technology innovations enabled by using big data to understand personalized brain development will be communicated in a tiered method. Outreach to the K-12 audience will target conceptualizing design criteria, inspiring students with interactive demonstrations, and providing capabilities for students to apply key concepts in hands-on engineering projects. For advanced students and researchers, new accessible course materials and online modules will be developed so that others may build upon the foundations established by this research.<br/><br/>Novel software, data wrangling tools, and resources will be created through two research thrusts organized around a novel test bed infrastructure and synthesized in a third education/outreach thrust. Thrust 1 (Personal Brain Trajectories) will focus on extracting meaningful information from medical images when performed at scale through (1) creating automated methods robust to variations in image quality, acquisition, and transfer errors, and (2) enabling efficient human-in-loop control at scale. The research will extend novel statistical models for image content labeling while adapting quality control techniques from industrial engineering. Thrust 2 (Novel Storage & Processing) will create novel medical imaging data models to describe data acquisition / retrieval, storage, cleaning, access / security, query and processing by integrating of medical imaging standards with big data architecture derived from social network and e-commerce communities. This infrastructure will provide practical access to petabyte imaging archives, integrate with existing data workflows, and effectively function with commodity hardware. The PI will develop and release a reference test bed to evaluate new technologies in the context of computer-aided detection (CADe) of brain abnormalities while considering age, sex, and demographics. Using the test bed, researchers and students will be able to efficiently evaluate existing and emerging image processing software to screen for potential prognostic markers. In Thrust 3 (Education and Outreach), the research results will be integrated into two classes targeting undergraduate students and interactive online modules created and released through an established graduate student/faculty training program. Each summer, an undergraduate and high school student will participate in research by implementing and extending research contributions within an interactive demonstration platform. In the second through fifth summers, a high school teacher will assist in the development of curricula targeting high school students using the demonstration platform. High school students and teachers will be recruited from Nashville Metro schools with a high underrepresented minority / reduced cost lunch populations. These efforts will create an open-source, open-hardware system for public demonstration and K-12 classroom exercises.","indigo"

Second, extensive collections of Cretaceous fossils from California will be properly curated and digitized for the first time. Third, within these holdings is an important private collection of Cretaceous and Miocene age fossils acquired by LACMIP, which will be curated and made accessible to researchers. Once properly housed, catalogued and photographed, all three collections will provide critical reference specimens for understanding past climatic, biogeographic, and environmental changes in the Western United States. The project will also allow continued growth of a program that provides hands-on training of student interns from nearby under-served universities and community colleges and STEM educators from local schools. Ultimately, the physical curation of more than 1.2 million specimens are improved, and the addition of 156,000 specimen records and 1,300 images will make the collections more accessible and useful for research.<br/><br/>The collections that will benefit from this award span much of the last 90 million years of geological history, environmental change, and evolution in California, and include representatives of most major invertebrate groups. This award will secure the future of these collections, increase their physical and digital accessibility, and for the first time, make them publically available for teaching, research, and outreach. More than 1.1 million Pliocene-Pleistocene fossils collected during the 1870s-1930s will be moved to archival trays and vials to permit their digitization. Nearly 126,000 Cretaceous fossils collected from California over the last 80 years will undergo substantial curatorial improvement, including rehousing, cataloguing, and digital imaging. A collection of some 30,000 specimens and associated stratigraphic data assembled from local Miocene and Cretaceous rocks will be unpacked and made accessible in new cabinets, housed in archival materials, and digitized. All data resulting from digitization of these collections will be archived in KE-EMu, a collections management system that integrates all of the NHM's biological, historical, and anthropological collections. Specimen records and digital images will also be fully integrated into existing data networks (e.g., iDigBio, GBIF, and the PBDB). The project will make these significant collections readily available to the public, thus providing a stimulus for research and resources for education. The resulting data will substantially increase accessible information about Cretaceous, Miocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene invertebrate biodiversity of the Eastern Pacific. Such data fills an existing gap, and will be of broad research value to paleontologists and malacologists in studies of environmental and climatic change, biogeography and paleoecology, and for systematic and molecular biologists. Specimen records and images will be discoverable from the LACMIP on-line portal (collections.nhm.org) and the national resource for Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections (www.idigbio.org).","puce"

While rule of law is considered a hallmark of stable governance, it is often lacking in these regions. Over the past half-century, American efforts to build democratic rule of law in developing countries have encountered limited successes and repeated failures. This project aims to uncover the origins of undemocratic legal systems in the developing world and why they are so resistant to reform during transitions to more democratic governance by focusing on the institutional choices made by governments during key periods of authoritarian consolidation. During the early years of dictatorship, some dictators confer legal authority to the formal judiciary, while others choose to erect ad hoc legal forums. These decisions have lasting legacies in determining the locus of judicial authority in developing countries, which ultimately affects how justice operates and who it ultimately serves. This has further implications for the protection of human rights under dictatorship. For American policymakers, identifying the stakeholders in authoritarian legal systems is thus an imperative first step towards creating effectively targeted reforms and building democratic rule of law abroad.<br/><br/>To understand how authoritarian legal systems in developing countries have emerged and evolved over time, this project utilizes mixed-methods analysis that combines both qualitative process-tracing techniques and statistical analysis. Original data will be gathered from British and American archives containing records on the political and legal development of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Archival research will leverage a variety of underutilized historical documents -- including party documents, official correspondences, judicial registers, court rulings, and memoires -- to understand how legal institutional design emerged and evolved across a large portion of the developing world. Using process-tracing techniques, case studies of countries such as Malawi, Kenya, and Burma will provide insight into how legal and authoritarian power was structured in the postcolonial period, and also examine how early legal decisions had lasting legacies that persist until today. Archival data will also be instrumental in creating an original cross-national dataset of cases that have been adjudicated in a variety of legal forums. This dataset, covering the period from independence to the modern day, will help identify generalizable patterns of legal decision-making across countries and over time. <br/><br/>This research project contributes to the understanding of authoritarian legal systems and the consolidation of dictatorships across a large portion of the developing world. It will deepen theoretical and empirical understanding of these themes in three important ways. First, it will help identify how despotic power can have long-lasting effects on the design and operation of legal institutions, even after the transition to democracy. Second, it will draw attention to the political effects of legal institutions in countries of Sub-Saharan-Africa and Southeast Asia, regions that have become critical economic and diplomatic partners of the United States. Third, it will provide new data on legal design from a critical period of nation-building in developing countries that can be employed for other studies extending beyond the scope of this project. This data will be made publicly available upon publication of the findings.","crimson"

As sensors become more accurate and cheaper and as data storage becomes effectively zero cost, there is increasing demand for data analysis tools that allow individuals to analyze and gain insight into their own personal data. This research project is developing new statistical machine learning algorithms for analyzing these types of data. The project has a particular focus on the development of models and algorithms to handle personal archives in the form of event time-series data, consisting of logs of time-stamped events involving interactions with other individuals as well as textual and other metadata. Testbed data sets being used to support this research include publicly-available archives of email histories, software development discussions, Twitter microblogs, Wikipedia editing interactions, and physical proximity data. In terms of broader societal impact, the data analysis tools being developed by this project have the potential to significantly transform how individuals analyze their personal data to better understand and monitor their physical and mental health.","indigo"

The project asks: How do legal cultures emerge so that law, though distantly created, becomes a local resource invoked by community members and routinely vindicated in court? Translating 'paper laws' into behavior on the ground is critical for all legal systems, but it is a particular challenge for federal, decentralized polities that lacks a military, an independent tax system, and a large bureaucracy. Such polities might rely on communities of lawyers, judges, legal academics, and civic associations to sustain the local operation of the law, particularly in cities, where most courts and litigants are located. Focusing on the European Union (EU) -- one of the most successful international organizations of the modern era -- and using a comparative historical analysis of how legal professionals across a set of European cities have organized to practice EU law, the project examines the diverse motives, organizational practices, and institutional constraints faced by these actors: How does local socio-economic context shape their motivations to invoke EU law? How do they promote awareness of EU law and amass the financial resources to vindicate it in court? And how does the organization of the domestic judiciary shape their ability to effectively secure the EU rights of local citizens? The resulting findings support comparative research into the variable uptake of legal rules in federal polities, where comparisons between the EU and the United States are particularly appropriate. That is, by analyzing how legal rules come to be practiced by local communities of legal professionals, the project identifies the various ways in which individual rights and the equal application of the law can be secured in diverse and decentralized legal systems.<br/><br/>A combination of interview, archival, and quantitative evidence, amassed via twelve months of fieldwork, will be leveraged to answer these questions. Preliminary research has already leveraged GIS technology and fieldwork in Italian cities to demonstrate that local engagement with EU varies at the city-level; additional fieldwork will assess the mechanisms underlying this variation and the generalizability of the findings to countries with diversely organized judiciaries. In this light, this project first leverages geocoded EU litigation data to select Italian cities where additional archival work can be conducted and key legal practitioners interviewed to probe how they understand EU law, what local supports exist for EU litigation, whether distinct local 'styles' of EU legal practice have crystallized, and how these practices evolve over time. Fieldwork will assess the hypothesis that local institutions -- such as universities and lawyers' associations -- entrench distinct city-level patterns of engagement with EU law depending on their ability to diffuse awareness of EU rules and to mobilize the material resources to vindicate them in court. To do so, EU litigation in northern Italian cities -- long boasting resource-rich, large-law-firm litigation support structures -- will be compared to EU litigation in southern cities, where institutions promoting EU legal practice have only recently been founded to train the many solo-practitioners there. Fieldwork will also identify how local, state, and EU actors shape the local litigation support structure necessary to participate in the EU legal system. To then determine whether Italian patterns of subnational engagement with EU law extend to different judicial systems, additional archival work and interviews in select French cities -- embedded within a more centralized judicial hierarchy than Italy's -- and German cities -- embedded within a more decentralized judiciary than Italy's -- will be conducted.","crimson"

It undertakes grammatical and lexical analyses of Nivacle, and comparative analyses of Pilagï¿½ and Nivacle grammatical structures and lexicon, also with an eye to what is known about other Chaco languages. Joint work on these languages is motivated by the fact that the traditional Nivacle territory extended from the mid-Pilcomayo River to the Bermejo River, partially overlapping Pilagï¿½ and Wichï¿½ (Mataco-Mataguayan) territories in northern Argentina. In this region there is evidence of potentially non-genetic diffusion of features. Pilagï¿½ is spoken by about 5,000 people; Nivacleï¿½ is spoken by fewer than 1,000 people in Argentina. There are more Nivacleï¿½ speakers in Paraguay, but language shift to Spanish is rapid, especially among the younger generations and especially among women married to criollo men. Field research is mostly in Argentina, with visits to Nivacleï¿½ communities in Paraguay to develop a better understanding of linguistic history and dialect variation. Analyses are undertaken in the field, and at universities in Argentina and Oregon.<br/><br/>Documentation under this project includes recording and videotaping of verbal performances to create a representative sample of genres. Some documentary materials were previously collected for Pilagaï¿½, but some were suboptimal for archiving, have not been fully analyzed or prepared for archiving, and extant materials are incomplete as far as genres; the current project addresses these issues. There has been little prior modern linguistic work on, or documentation of Nivacle.<br/><br/>Outcomes will include an archived corpus of 20 hours of video and audio recordings, databases with from five to ten hours per language of translated and analyzed elicited and text materials, and tri- or quadri-lingual lexical databases (Pilagaï¿½, Nivacleï¿½, Spanish, English). It will enable open access to materials for speakers and the linguistic community, ethical considerations permitting. Focused analyses investigate the grammatical constructions of Nivacle and compare Pilagaï¿½-Nivacleï¿½ grammatical and lexical issues. The results increase understanding of diffusion of structural features and lexica, as opposed to inheritance of features from proto-languages in the Chaco region. The project investï¿½gates internal divisions and influences among Chaco languages. It amplifies knowledge of world-wide patterns in expressing possession, ways of classifying in-view/out-of-view objects, the development of tense/aspect from determiners, grammatical relations and stative/active systems, and other linguistic features.<br/><br/>The documentary cultural and linguistic materials are of interest and use to the language communities for their education and language revitalization goals, and will be explained and promoted in community workshops. They are useful to other linguists, educators, anthropologists, and historians. The project provides training for at least three students (two graduate), and for native speakers. Indeed, the project is a joint effort between researchers and the language communities. It further strengthens research partnerships and between the University of Oregon and the Instituto de Investigaciones Lingï¿½ï¿½sticas of the National University of Formosa, with the potential to create new research opportunities for students of both countries.","maroon"

The researchers are targeting three climatically-sensitive regions where tree-ring width (RW) records of this length are available in existing sample archives from the Gulf of Alaska in southern Alaska, Sukakpak in northern Alaska, and northwestern Canada (Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta). The resulting climate reconstructions will be compared with climate model outputs to examine spatiotemporal patterns in response to climate forcing (particularly volcanoes), identify uncertainties, and test hypotheses regarding internal and forced modes of variability.<br/><br/>This award will generate a suite of novel, maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies for these sites using the Blue Intensity (BI) parameter, which is substantially less costly and labor intensive yet retains the accuracy and resolution of traditional MXD techniques. There are few sub-millennial to millennial scale MXD-based chronologies currently existing for this vast region. The researchers argue that the resulting BI chronologies, based on living and subfossil wood material, will yield robust records of past climatic extremes, trends and shifts in past temperature, spatiotemporal expressions of internal Pacific variability, as well as details regarding the external climate forcing over northwestern North America for the past millennium. <br/><br/>The research project has broad impact in four key aspects, namely:<br/><br/>First, this project will synthesize a network of climatically-sensitive tree-ring records from across northwestern North America to yield high-resolution, strongly calibrated reconstructions on past climate variability from intra-seasonal to Decadal to Centennial time scales. These dendroclimatic reconstructions will mainly be developed using existing data that will be processed to extract new information using the new BI technique, along with the development of field temperature reconstructions. Tree-ring data will be compared to model output and other proxy records and made available to the modeling community. This research will help advance a broader understanding of the long-term variability of climate over the past millennium for one of the most rapidly changing regions of the globe.<br/><br/>Second, scientific results from the project will be archived and provided to the scientific community through the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB). <br/><br/>Third, as appropriate, the researchers will engage with native groups in Alaska. In the past, the PIs have interacted extensively with northern communities by involving native peoples in research and plan to continue to do so for this project. The potential research outcomes could have relevance to native populations and the data and interpretations will be available to relevant communities (community groups, e.g. Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Cooperative, http://www.taiga.net/coop/index.html).<br/><br/>Fourth, the project will support undergraduate and graduate students as part of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and the student program at The College of Wooster.

The researcher proposes to visit four archives to complete archival and rare book research: the Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation in Pittsburgh, the Newnham College Archives at the University of Cambridge in England, the University of St. Andrews Special Collections in Scotland, and the Rudolf Steiner House Library in London. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the history of biology, the results of this project will provide a context for and exposure to different aspects of morphology for those working with morphology in education and design settings. STEM educational institutions have used morphology to encourage environmental stewardship. Morphology also has significant implications in the design sciences, particularly for biomimicry. By reaching out to educators, designers, and the broader public through lectures, a blog, and conferences, the significance of the research proposed under this grant would have a broad impact.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This project contributes to the historical literature on science in three ways. It examines the role of scientific alienation in our understanding of the Goethean tradition within plant morphology and beyond. This will add to discussions of scientific literacy and cultural engagement with science as the concept of scientific alienation engages with the experiences of those who make claims of being marginalized as they seek to engage with scientific knowledge and practices. In addition, it examines traditionally trained and amateur scientists who engaged with Goethe's science and used his concepts to critique scientific norms and explore the relation of science to other areas of society. Finally, it shows how scientists often engage audiences at the fringe of the scientific community and well beyond it. Specifically, Goethe's scientific and larger cultural heritage in the twentieth century Anglophone world engaged with the core literature of environmental movements. Together, these themes exhibit how Goethe's reception and twentieth century morphology may be fruitful for other areas of research being pursued by historians of science.","crimson"

This project will integrate research and education with undergraduates at the West Campus of Arizona State University that serves a very diverse community with a high percentage of first-generation college students.

For the field of animal behavior, data sharing and access presents a range of challenges due to the collection and use of numerous data types, the need to address standards, and a common strategy for archiving some key data types. For example, audiovisual recordings require substantial ""hands on"" time for processing, large storage capacity for large files, rich descriptive metadata, and constant migration to new formats as technologies change. As a consequence, these behavioral data remain prohibitively under-curated and broadly inaccessible to the biological research community. Yet, at the same time, biologists and other researchers are collecting vast amounts of such data, and this trend is increasing as recording technologies become more sophisticated and inexpensive. These data will remain generally inaccessible if the challenges of archiving digital media are not addressed. <br/><br/>This award funds a workshop to be held at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 2016. The meeting will bring together experts from a number of relevant fields to discuss preservation and accessibility of samples relevant to research on animal behavior and physiology. Representatives and experts from several stakeholder communities will come together to document the challenges of making behavioral data broadly accessible, and to develop a framework that prioritizes the key issues. Outcomes will be published in a white paper and a formal publication. The meeting will be relevant to the development of methods and approaches to citizen science projects that emphasize the use of digital media. Graduate students and postdocs will participate in the meeting itself, providing a valuable experience and enhancing their training and background in data archiving and accessibility.","teal"

Linguists do this by comparing a set of languages along various dimensions, such as words or language structures that may have a common origin. Documentation of a language plays a key role in how scholars reconstruct the family relationships between languages, but when the documentation exists in archives, in ""analog"" forms, like handwritten field notes or cassette recordings, this creates challenges in doing reconstruction of family relationships. This project will address this challenge focusing on three underdocumented languages, whose archival materials have received little attention in the linguistic literature. The research team will digitize materials, and then process and analyze them by creating a database of the three languages. This research infrastructure will create digital access to the materials and will create a lexicon of use to both linguistic science and to learners. Tututni, Coquille and Galice, the focus of this project, are three severely endangered Native American languages of the Oregon Coast. Broader impacts include the dissemination of the lexicon to Native communities and the scholarly community, and the education and training of three budding Native social scientists, broadening participation in the linguistics by underrepresented groups. <br/><br/><br/>The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. The Athabaskan language family includes many languages and has an expansive geographic distribution, ranging from Alaska and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada and to the southwest including Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma. Southwest Oregon Athabaskan language communities were extremely fragmented following the forced relocation of members to reservations during the 1850s-60s, termination of tribes in the 1950s and boarding school language policies. However, Tututni, Coquille and Galice have extensive documentation, most of which neither easily accessible nor linguistically analyzed, a gap in the scientific understanding of an important branch of Athabaskan languages. By digitizing and databasing this archival documentation, this project will increase the linguistic understanding of relationships in the Athabaskan family. Methods include the linguistic analysis of verbs, notoriously complex in this language family, and transcription of legacy recordings. These materials, collected between the 1880s and 1980s, will be analyzed and synthesized into a single database. Scientific hypotheses can be tested against the large bodies of research to yield new discoveries and explanations for Athabaskan languages and their family relationships, especially those of the Pacific Coast branch. Results will also promote language use in Oregon Athabaskan communities and advance education of diverse groups, as these Native citizen scientists engage with the lexicon and the disseminated resources in a host of initiatives, including language and cultural revitalization.","maroon"

The portion of the intergalactic medium (IGM) that is photo-ionized and heated to temperatures of order 10,000 K outweighs the baryonic (i.e., ordinary) matter inside galaxies by roughly a factor of 4. This gas can be studied in relatively nearby galaxies by observing the hydrogen Lyman-alpha absorption line in the spectra of more distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) near the same line of sight. The Principal Investigator and collaborators have shown that about half of the Lyman-alpha absorbers at redshifts less than 0.017 are located within about 400 kiloparsecs of a moderate-sized or larger galaxy. The team will continue and expand upon this work, in four parts: (1) improve the statistics by a factor of order 10 using archival AGN spectra obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope; (2) identify all bright galaxies near all observed AGN lines of sight, using public archival data and new observations with ground-based telescopes; (3) improve the quality of the existing estimates of galaxy distances, luminosities, classifications, and orientations, using published data and new data when appropriate; and (4) perform an in-depth analysis of the physical conditions in individual absorbers. The goal is to determine the properties of the absorbers as a function of distance from the galaxy, separately for galaxies of different types, sizes, luminosities and environments. This project will train a graduate student to make use of space-based ultraviolet and ground-based optical and radio observational facilities, some involving international collaborations. Some parts of the project will be made appropriate for research projects for undergraduate students, including those participating in the formal Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the performing institution.

This understanding can only be gained by a breakthrough in understanding physics at the scales of the smallest individual clouds that observations can detect, which is not possible except by using multi-scale simulations rigorously coupled to data. The study will reveal the physical state of CGM gas, constrain the timescales over which CGM clouds evolve, and determine the mass flow rates and total masses moving in and out of galaxies.<br/><br/>These results will be the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved. The project will involve junior scientists in front line research, especially targeting under-represented students, and contributing to mentoring skills amongst the intermediate-level researchers. It will also support development of a new planetarium show that includes visualized hydro-dynamical simulations of the gas in galaxies.","lime"

The project partnership includes scientists at three research centers, education researchers, and middle school teachers. The completed curriculum will provide opportunities for middle school students and teachers to compare their locally collected data with historic data to create unique and powerful learning opportunities. The collaboration between scientists and schools introduces middle school students to local, community citizen science endeavors with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>The project is innovative in linking direct exploration of current, local conditions with archived data to examine long-term changes in natural phenomena that cannot be directly perceived. Components of the model being developed will include: a) a standards-aligned curriculum; b) field and lab activities that engage students in collecting and analyzing data on local biotic and abiotic indicators of climate change; c) integration with a current climate science research program; d) support materials for teachers and scientists (print and electronic) and a digital teacher professional development program; and e) a project Website. During development of these curricular components, barriers to implementation of this learning strategy will be identified and studied. The findings of this project have the potential to broadly impact middle school science education practices by introducing a curricular model that links direct data collection with analysis of archived data to study long-term environmental changes that are not directly perceived.","azure"

This EXP project will continue collaborations (begun under an EAGER award) among learning sciences researchers, exhibit designers, and curators in library and museum organizations with extensive cultural heritage collections, and community organizations serving the regional area of Nashville. The goal is to develop and study mobile digital technologies that bridge public urban spaces and curated museum / library collections in order to create new types of learning activities. These technologies will enable youth and other city residents (or visiting tourists) to Nashville to create and share digital spatial story lines (DSSLs). DSSLs use personal narratives to map the archival media from the aforementioned curated collections onto city neighborhoods at a walking or biking scale. DSSLs are narrative index and media delivery structures that make vibrant aspects of past and present cultural heritage (e.g., American Roots Music and Civil Rights activism) available at a personal, embodied scale.<br/><br/>As active participation in emerging technologies of this sort becomes an increasingly important means of civic engagement, a critical challenge for democratic societies will be to develop new forms of learning and teaching through which citizens, and especially youth, become fluent with them.

The project will further develop archival material as digital sandboxes for storytelling at a regional scale in the Music City, and it will identify and develop concepts in data curation, digital mapping, and spatial analysis for explicit use in making and sharing DSSLs. and design and study how authoring DSSLs can be used to learn about public history, data curation, and digital mapping and analysis. The project will also explore how DSSLs can be leveraged to help users learn not only about public history but also about the concepts and technologies (data curation; digital mapping and analysis) that under-gird the DSSLs themselves.

The research will provide new insights into the causality and spatio-temporal relationships of Dutch elm disease spread as well as the broader dispersal of forest pests and diseases throughout America's countryside and urban environments. The findings will be particularly relevant for a better understanding of the biogeography of invasive species and invasions as well as the impacts of human interactions with forests and urban environments. The research has significant broader implications for forest managers and public policy with regard to adopting proactive and effective mechanisms for the control of other current and future tree diseases and pests. The doctoral student will work with government agencies and nongovernmental organizations at the local, state, and national levels to disseminate the findings. The research can inform efforts to save flora and to prevent significant economic impacts. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Prior to the introduction of Dutch elm disease in the United States, elm trees (Ulmus americana) were planted ubiquitously in cities across the country. The popularity of elm trees, however, was severely impacted by Dutch elm disease which was introduced in the United States during the early 1930s. Over the next four decades the disease spread until elms were effectively removed from urban environments. The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will focus on three core questions: (1) After its introduction to the United States, what were the spatio-temporal extents of Dutch elm disease spread? (2) What were the primary management methods used in an attempt to control Dutch elm disease, how did they change over time, where were they implemented, and why did they vary in success and failure? (3) How did Dutch elm disease affect urban landscapes in the United States? The researchers will combine archival data and mapping software in a Historic Geographic Information Systems to visualize, map and analyze the spread of Dutch elm disease particularly in relation to the policies used to control it at both a national scale and at the local scale via a case study of Syracuse, NY.

In this study, MIT researchers in conjunction with a large multi-national team will carry out analyses of GPS data, which track the directions and speeds of the plates, for this region that have been collected over the past 20 years in an effort to better understand the plate interactions in this region as well as the motion of earthquake generating faults such as the North Anatolian fault. The range of active geodynamic processes that characterize this plate system (continental collision, subduction/slab rollback, lithospheric delamination, continental transform faults and triple junctions, volcanism, ocean and continental rifting), when studied through the lens of the new GPS data, affords new insights into active continental tectonics with broader implications for earthquake, tsunami, and volcanic natural hazards. The potential for the proposed activity to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes lies primarily in the following: (1) improved well-being of individuals in society through improved basis of earthquake hazard estimation along the Africa-Arabia-Eurasia plate boundary system; (2) increased partnerships through a substantial international collaboration; and (3) enhanced infrastructure for research by archiving a large amount of data from international partner data in the UNAVCO database for open access.<br/><br/>In collaboration with many international institutions, a new secular velocity field for the Africa-Arabia-Eurasia plate system based on continuous and survey observations for the period 1994-2014 has been generated. The velocity field includes major densification and improved resolution around active structures (North and East Anatolian, Dead Sea, and Main Caucasus Thrust faults, Hellenic arc, Gulf of Corinth rift, Zagros Fold and Thrust belt, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and East African rifts, Danakil and Afar depression) and areas characterized by low internal strain rates (East Turkey/Iranian High Plateau, central Anatolia, south-central Aegean/Peloponnese, Arabian Plate). This project, carried in collaboration with researchers from France, Turkey, and Australia, utilizes this new velocity to explore the behavior of various components of the Arabia-Africa-Eurasia plate system. Research on the Aegean and western/central Anatolia deformation focuses on block and continuum deformation models, and estimating slip rates on major faults. Work on the North Anatolian fault slip rates and locking depths will provide improved constraints on slip rates and locking depths along the full, approximately 1200 km extent of the fault and constrain possible variations in rates and locking depths that may be related to the time since the last earthquake, and/or spatial variations in other fault characteristics. Finally, study of Africa-Arabia-Eurasia intra- and inter-plate deformation and dynamics investigates kinematic models for the system.

These cave carbonate deposits hold huge potential for reconstructing terrestrial paleoclimate, because their isotopic compositions reflect mean annual surface temperatures and their formation age can be precisely dated. However, various kinetic processes are involved in this type of carbonate formation, complicating the interpretation of their isotopic compositions. This impedes the realization of the full potential of these paleoclimate archives. Recent development of the carbonate ""clumped isotope"" thermometer offers new opportunities for reconstructing paleotemperatures based on these carbonates. Unlike the conventional carbonate-water oxygen isotope thermometer, this novel clumped isotope thermometer can determine carbonate formation temperatures without assumptions about the isotopic compositions of the water from which carbonate precipitates. But this thermometer has not escaped the influence of kinetic effects. Direct application of this thermometer to natural speleothems has resulted in systematic overestimations of their formation temperatures. This proposal seeks to systematically determine the isotope effects, especially clumped isotope effects, associated with carbonate formation induced by CO2 degassing, through series of well-characterized laboratory experiments. The overarching goal of this project is to provide a quantitative framework for interpreting the isotopic compositions of this type of carbonates in nature and thus enable robust paleotemperature reconstructions based on their isotope compositions. Undergraduate students will be exposed to the state-of-the-art technologies for aqueous carbonate chemistry measurements and stable isotope analysis during the course of this project.<br/><br/>Specifically, the investigators propose to determine (1) the kinetics of the clumped isotope exchange between different dissolved inorganic carbon species and water, and (2) the kinetic isotope fractionation factors associated with bicarbonate (HCO3-) dehydration and dehydroxylation reactions - the key pathways for converting dissolved HCO3- to CO2. This proposed work will bring together the respective expertise of two investigators in clumped isotope geochemistry and aquatic carbonate chemistry. The use of state-of-the-art technologies for solution carbonate chemistry measurements will make it feasible to pair the changes in solution carbonate chemistry with isotope measurements, and thus allow detailed investigation of the kinetic controls on the isotopic compositions of carbonate precipitates. The parameters to be determined in this project are fundamental for understanding the isotope systematics of aqueous carbonate system, and will be applicable in many future studies.","hot_pink"

In the biology domain, researchers and data managers have expressed the need to use identifiers from the moment of data creation and throughout the research lifecycle. A wide range of methods are used in the biological sciences to produce many different kinds of data, which may require the application of different types of identifiers to make connections between physical samples, digital data, analysis, and publications. This project will develop and evaluate proof-of-concept and prototype services with particular focus on DNA/RNA sequence data. This will expand on data modeling work done as part of the iPlant Data Commons, using real world biology datasets from iPlant, the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). Project results will be disseminated across the biology and information science communities. Software generated during this project will be maintained in an open source software repository for further development by the community. Some of these products will benefit smaller organizations that provide repository services but have limited software development staffing. This research will inform the development of similar services for different data types and in other domains dealing with issues identification through a project's lifecycle.<br/><br/>There is a growing need for services to verify, track, and report events (i.e. provenance) in relation to identified datasets over time. Such services should start as early as possible in the life of a research project and be as much as possible automated. Much of the current research and development around digital identifiers focuses on facilitating data citation and discovery post-publication.

The increasing availability of large volumes of different kinds of data offers new opportunities to address these issues. This project will provide the environmental research community with efficient and reliable means for data management, storage, and sharing. The facilities developed will allow researchers, policy makers, managers, and other stakeholders to bring relevant data to bear on complex environmental questions. Modern approaches that encourage geographically distributed collaboration will be used to increase efficiency of data curation beyond those available for single projects.

Data that are archived in a stable, accessible repository and that are accompanied by appropriate metadata benefit both data producers and consumers through improved discoverability and reliability. This project builds on expertise available in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community to provide these benefits. The project will leverage the collective experience of the LTER community to improve data management across a broad community through communication and collaboration. Training activities will be developed that range from the basics of metadata creation to the adoption of standardized best practices for specific types of data. The development of templates for describing a data lifecycle will accelerate the availability of data for synthesis. The project will promote shared technology to develop more commonly usable and more efficient approaches to data curation workflows. Participants in training workshops will be trained in developing workflow technology, re-using existing workflows, and archiving and sharing their developments. Through these workshops, together with community-level centers of expertise, and individual-based skill exchanges, the project will increase the volume of data available along with data discoverability and reuse. The Provenance Aware Synthesis Architecture repository will ensure long-term availability of data and open data access through federations such as DataONE. This repository will be expanded in several ways to accommodate a broader community of data providers and users. Enhancements include a scalable user identity management system, improved data documentation procedures to simplify data submission for non-technical users, and expanded data-quality assurance tools to accommodate a broader range of community practices.

Currently there are about 1,150 described species, with new ones being discovered annually. They have sausage-shaped bodies, with 8 legs ending in long claws. Water bears are unique because they can enter a state of 'suspended life' called cryptobiosis as their habitat dries out. In this stage, they can tolerate extreme conditions of cold, heat, vacuum, and pressure. Water bears may remain in this condition for many years until moisture returns allowing them to continue on with their lives. For a long time few scientists studied tardigrades because they were thought to have little economic or health value that were important to humans. However, their ability to suspend life is now being studied as a way to extend the 'shelf life' of organs harvested for transplant. It has also been discovered that in this suspended state water bears may be dispersed by wind carrying plant disease-causing bacteria, and that as a result they may be responsible for the spread of some crop diseases. The medical and industrial applications of this biology plus the disease issues make it critical to understand the global distribution of water bear species and to develop an up-to-date taxonomic framework to facilitate this work. <br/><br/>Water bear research necessarily starts with museum collections. The largest North American collection is housed in the Bohart Museum of Entomology. Most of this 35,000 slide collection was acquired in the 1960-70s, and was prepared according to the best practices of the time. Unfortunately, best practices of the time meant using non-archival mounting media, which degrades over time. As a result the specimens are rapidly deteriorating. In addition, the taxonomy of the specimens has not been updated since the 1970's and they have not been databased. To address these issues, this project seeks to stabilize, repair and restore the specimens mounting them in archival quality media, image each specimen and upload the images and associated metadata on-line and integrate all data with iDigBio. The project will also train undergraduates at Fresno City College and UC Davis in the processes of preparation, repair, documentation, and data entry of large-scale collections. Initially, type and voucher specimens will be remounted - after the process has been perfected with duplicate specimens of non-type material - following lessons learned during a similar project on another group of arthropods, parasitoid wasps. Following this initial phase all other non-type specimens will be addressed. All data resulting from this project will be posted on line at the Bohart Museum website, http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/ and shared with IDigBio, https://www.idigbio.org/, ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.

Through Topic Modeling, they will summarize the thematic content and show how the most important subjects change over time. And Social Network extraction will allow them to reveal the informal relationships that shape policy from day-to-day. By bringing together all of this quantitative declassified data in a single platform, the project will advance work by political scientists as well as scholars of communications and social networks who seek to understand agenda-setting, power, and influence within and between organizations. The platform will enable researchers to test fundamental questions in IR theory, such as whether policymakers generally speak to one another in terms of ""state security,"" as realists insist, or ""international norms,"" as liberalism assumes. It will allow users to shift between different levels of analysis, from an aggregate view of whole archives, to filtered subsets of metadata, to the specific words in one sentence that produced a single data point. It will bring together quantitative and qualitative approaches to research in international relations, and make both more transparent, rigorous, and replicable.","aquamarine"

Drones enable on-demand, high resolution data collection across ocean environments, while reducing costs and human risk. The potential applications for promoting the progress of marine science are vast, including studies of changing coastlines, measuring ocean water quality, counting animals such as seabirds and sea turtles, assessing the health and behavior of animals, and even sampling the breath of individual whales. Despite their demonstrated utility for marine science and conservation missions, there is little support for researchers to integrate drones into their scientific studies. Similarly, there are few programs designed to train students to use drones in marine science and conservation programs. This project addresses these gaps by establishing a research and training facility that will enhance the capacity of NSF-funded researchers, and other portions of the scientific community on the US East Coast, to use drones for the study and conservation of coastal and marine systems.&#8232; <br/><br/>This project will i) repurpose and renovate an existing building to create engineering, computational, and visualization/training/outreach laboratories for UAS research, ii) diversify a fleet of UAS to increase capabilities available to the scientific community in the region, iii) develop a data analysis, visualization, and storage framework for products generated by the facility. Numerous challenges associated with operating UAS will benefit from this centralized regional marine facility, including FAA licensing and permitting, development and deployment of marine-specific sampling methods, maintenance of the social license to operate, centralized data archiving, and by establishing a locus for sensor, computational, and visualization tool development in response to the scientific needs of coastal and marine researchers. The UAS facility will enable studies of the ecosystem consequences of human activities in marine habitats, including dynamics and processes. This new sampling capability provides aerial imagery from visible to infrared and hyperspectral wavelengths, as well as other geo-referenced sensor data, including light detection and ranging (LIDAR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). UAS are also now used to sample atmospheric phenomena (wind, aerosols) and can even be used to sample breath from individual whales. The potential coastal applications range from studies of changing coastal geomorphology to population dynamics and behavior of marine vertebrates such as seals and turtles. Archived, geospatially referenced data will be invaluable for long-term studies of change related to storm events and sea-level rise in coastal areas. The facility will enable hands-on sensor and computational development experience for students in engineering and biology programs at Duke, and will support a summer training course in research methods open to professionals as well as undergraduate and graduate students. The facility will also support marine science interaction in the local community and established STEM outreach initiatives including local public school aviation clubs and summer programs at local the Boys and Girls Clubs.","puce"

Often some of the knowledge required to innovate comes from outside the boundaries of the firm. Hiring scientists and engineers with the right experience is a powerful mechanism for transferring knowledge into the firm. Not only can the movement of scientists and engineers between firms affect innovation within firms, it can also affect the aggregate development of high-technology industries. Yet, we know relatively little about this channel of knowledge communication. What type of employee prior experience aids a firm in successfully pursuing new technological areas? What are the social and structural factors within an organization that facilitate employees? transferring knowledge developed during their prior experiences? And ultimately, what are the implications of this knowledge transfer for firm innovation and industry evolution? <br/><br/>This project addresses three important questions. First, using archival data it documents the aggregate impact of employee mobility on firms and industries and the implications of employee mobility for innovation and innovation policy. Second, complementing the archival analyses, the project uses interviews with scientists and engineers working on laser technology and provides a detailed analysis of how employees transfer knowledge from their prior experiences and what facilitates this process. Third, the project uses an experimental approach to examine the causal mechanisms through which personnel mobility enables knowledge transfer and innovation. This multi-method approach combining a field study, which has high external validity, with a laboratory study that has high internal validity provides insights into challenging, yet important, questions on knowledge transfer by personnel mobility.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This research increases understanding of employee mobility?s role in innovation in firms. For instance, the movement of scientists and engineers from firms currently in a high-technology market to firms not yet in the market can lower the barrier for these firms to enter. These firms can benefit from vital knowledge individuals bring with them on market logistics or norms or ideas on new product variants that the prior employer did not pursue. From this understanding, there are implications about the conditions under which the employment mobility of scientists and engineers ought to be supported, by, for example, fostering policies that allow individuals to more easily move from job to job (such as non-employer tied health insurance or limiting employee non-compete contracts) or encouraging organizational structures that facilitate knowledge transfer by individuals.","aquamarine"

Over the past several decades paleoclimatologists have developed myriad proxy indicators of past regional climate that are recorded in natural archives such as ice cores, cave deposits, and lake sediment, among many other archives. Proxy paleoclimate records from the tropics are particularly important because this region is the ?heat engine? of Earth. Long- and short-term changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation that are manifested in such phenomenon as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the response of the tropics to high latitude climatic ?events? are critical to understand because these phenomena can have a profound impact on regional water balance, which directly affects potable water supplies, hydroelectricity generation, and agricultural productivity. <br/> The longest continuous records of climate change in the tropics are limited to those derived from the relatively few old lake basins in the region. Lake Junin, the largest lake located entirely within Peru, is among the oldest lake basins in South America. It contains a sediment record that is at least 200 m long that may extend more than 250,000 years. Lake Junin is exceptional in the length of record that it contains, but also in the climate signals that it records. Considerable prior research has documented that Lake Junin records the waxing and waning of nearby alpine glaciers and changes in regional water balance through the isotope geochemistry of calcium carbonate deposited on the lake bottom at a rate of approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr. This research will develop these and other proxy climate records for the full length of recovered core; the records generated will comprise one of the longest continuous records of climate and environmental change from the inner tropics. <br/> The Lake Junin Drilling Project has several broader impacts. These include the joint renovation of an abandoned lodge for future shared use as the first shoreline outpost for officials of the Junin National Reserve, as a visitor center, and as a lake access point for ecotourism. Capacity building activities in the Junin Project include collaboration with Peruvian universities, training of geoscientists, as well as Peruvian and American student training. A specific team will be responsible for the organization of lectures at villages in the region to inform citizens about the significance of the drilling, and will work closely with the national park service to instruct the rangers on how to use the science to promote conservation efforts around the lake. During the drilling, a team will facilitate interactions with local and international media. The team expect to involve U.S. and Peruvian students in all aspects of Junin drilling, and much of the paleoecological research related to the Junin cores will be conducted by graduate students. Training opportunities during the drilling phase of operations are also planned for geoscientists from Peruvian universities. Numerous U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow will be involved in all phases of the proposed research. The material collected during this project will set the stage for significant future research. LacCore, the National Lacustrine Core Facility at the University of Minnesota, will facilitate this by overseeing the long-term storage, curation, and access to data and samples obtained in this project.<br/><br/>Technical Explanation<br/> Lake Junin, located at 4000 m asl in the inner-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, is a prime target for drilling because it contains a thick (>200 m) sediment package deposited at a high rate (0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr). Abundant research conducted on and around Lake Junin provides a compelling rationale for deep drilling. Moraine mapping coupled with cosmogenic radionuclide dating indicate that paleoglaciers reached the lake edge, but have not overridden the lake in as much as one million years. Lake Junin is one of the few lakes in the tropical Andes that predates the maximum extent of glaciation and is in a geomorphic position to record the waxing and waning of glaciers in nearby cordillera. Sediment coring of Lake Junin began in the 1970s; two cores spanning the past 50,000 years reveal that sedimentation has alternated between clastic sediments deposited during peak glacial periods and authigenic calcite (marl) precipitated from the water column during interglacial times. The lake also contains ideal sediments for multiproxy analysis that can be reliably dated using both the radiocarbon and U/Th methods. The oxygen isotopic composition of marl and ostracod carapaces demonstrate that authigenic calcite in Lake Junin primarily records the isotopic composition of precipitation and secondarily the degree of evaporative enrichment of lake water. Lake Junin contains a continuous record of tropical hydroclimate over interglacial and interstadial intervals for much of the past several hundred thousand years that is both comparable to, and an extension of stable isotope records from regional ice cores and speleothems. New organic geochemical proxies compliment the marl isotope record and offer the potential for a truly continuous isotope paleoclimate record through glacial and interglacial intervals alike. Lake Junin is ideally situated, both from logistical and scientific standpoints, to provide continuous high-resolution, independently-dated, long-term records of glaciation, and the variability of phenomena such as ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Because of the strong, demonstrated U/Th dating potential of Junin marl, we will be able to address critical issues regarding the synchrony of climate change in the tropics with that in high latitude regions of both hemispheres, the rate and timing of ecosystem response to climatic perturbations, and the dynamics of the geomagnetic field from a tropical perspective. Lake Junin is a scientifically mature site that will yield critical scientific insights that only drilling coupled with analysis can unlock.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop the first continuous, high-resolution, absolute-dated late Quaternary record of climate change, water balance (P/E), glaciation, vegetation, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the tropical Andes. The well-dated Junin record will allow the team to develop proxy records spanning >200,000yr, which will document the timing of wet/dry cycles, glacial advances/retreats, and the impacts of climatic phenomena such as the changing strength and variability of ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and shifts in the location and range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, this study will provide an opportunity to date (via U-Th) the >40ka sections of both the Titicaca and Sabana de Bogota records through correlation of pollen, stable isotope, and paleomagnetic time series. This study will also enable important insights into the response of tropical vegetation to climate change in the upper Amazon Basin, and will provide a rare southern equatorial perspective on the evolution of Earth?s geomagnetic field.","hot_pink"

In making several decades of primary data available to the public on-line at the University of Michigan through IPSCR, this project broadens the dissemination of scientific data to enhance scientific and technological understanding.<br/><br/>Dr. Napoleon Chagnon of the University of Missouri at Columbia, and Dr. Raymond Hames of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln will explore the impact of marriage form, marital alliances, kin presence, and parental loss on fertility, offspring survivorship and marital stability. This project has two objectives. The first is to make the Yanomamo demographic and genealogical data base available to researchers via the Internet for use by interested social scientists who wish to test a wide variety of theories revolving around kinship, demographic processes, and marriage. The second goal is to test a variety of human evolutionary theories that address how variation in marriage form, marriage duration, and kin support affects the wellbeing and marital and social success of children. As a natural fertility population with little outside contact and with all known marital forms the Yanomamo are uniquely suited to shed light on the nature of human marriage and families. Just as importantly, the Yanomamï¿½ data base is the largest ever amassed for any tribal population. It was collected over a 35 year period through 25 field trips by Napoleon Chagnon from 1964-1999. Currently, this largely prospective data base has genealogical and demographic information on approximately 4,159 (2,107 living and 2,052 deceased) individuals and the project will permit the addition of another 2,500 Yanomamo who have yet to be entered, error checked, and integrated into the current data base. Its resultant size will allow comprehensive statistical analysis not possible with smaller data bases collected by anthropologists. The data will be archived for downloading in a variety of standard formats for statistical analysis. In addition, the project will create a freely available but more user friendly version of KINDEMCOM, a unique PC comparative statistical program designed for sophisticated genealogical analysis of the data. Once the data base is complete and publically goes on-line through IPSCR at the University of Michigan the project leaders and other interested social scientists will be able to investigate the genealogical and demographic dimensions of cultural and biological success.","maroon"

The host institution for this fellowship is Cornell University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Irby J. Lovette. <br/><br/>Natural hybrid zones offer the opportunity to investigate evolution in action and the future of biodiversity, while providing insight into the mechanisms driving reproductive isolation between two interacting species. Comparison of temporally replicated data, in particular, provides valuable insight into how a hybrid zone is shifting or expanding in time and space. The fellowship research uses a temporally replicated approach to evaluate patterns in a hybrid zone between two tidal marsh endemics, the Saltmarsh and Nelson's sparrow. This hybrid zone has expanded approximately 160 km in less than a century; however, pure species boundaries appear to be maintained. Temporal comparisons provide new insight into the maintenance of genetically and morphologically pure populations in the face of rapid hybrid zone expansion and is of utmost importance in the northeastern U.S. to local and regional governmental and non-governmental groups concerned with conservation, as Saltmarsh and Nelson's sparrows are both high priority species in this area; the Saltmarsh Sparrow, in particular, is considered globally vulnerable to extinction. The approach combines the use of valuable archived biological collections and cutting edge genomic analyses of extant populations to document the dynamics between Nelson's and Saltmarsh sparrows over the past 125 years. Specimens come from several collections, including Cornell University, Delaware Museum of Natural History, Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, the University of Connecticut, the University of Maine, and the Canadian Museum of Nature. Given the vulnerability of Nelson's and Saltmarsh sparrows to habitat loss and degradation, a better understanding of temporal dynamics promises to aid the projection of future outcomes in this area as well as general understanding of hybrid zones.<br/><br/>Training goals inchude gaining expertise in population genomics and in newly developed approaches to sequencing partial genomes from archived biological specimens. Educational and public outreach include sharing results of Saltmarsh and Nelson's sparrow interactions with the Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program, a regional, collaborative tidal-marsh bird monitoring and conservation initiative concerned with management plans for the species, and the very popular interactive websites of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, e.g., All About Birds and All About Bird Biology.","puce"

The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Nancy Chen is ""Elucidating the genomic and phenotypic basis of contemporary evolution in Florida Scrub-Jays."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of California, Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Graham Coop.<br/><br/>Recent studies have demonstrated evolution on ecological timescales (that is, shorter than previously thought) in a number of different organisms. Studying contemporary evolution is the only way to directly test many fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, such as the persistence of high levels of genetic variation in the presence of selection. Several theories seeking to explain this long-standing paradox have been proposed; however, empirical validations of these predictions are rare in natural populations because they require a particular type of biological collection: archived DNA samples with associated phenotypic and fitness measures for several thousand individuals over multiple generations. Despite increasing interest in measuring evolution in real-time and increasing availability of suitable datasets, rigorous methods for inferring natural selection from these types of data are lacking. Needed is the development of new methods that leverage longitudinal population samples and pedigree information to test for selection on complex traits at different life-history stages. This powerful framework for studying contemporary evolution further increases the insights that can be gained from biological collections. The fellowship research develops and applies novel analytical methods to study short-term selection on complex traits in the Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), using a unique collection of archived blood and DNA samples at the Cornell Museum of Vertebrates as well as associated demographic and ecological data stored at Archbold Biological Station. Application of these methods to the Florida Scrub-Jays improves our understanding of the importance of selection in maintaining genetic variation in natural populations.<br/><br/>Training goals include gaining the computational and quantitative skills necessary to develop and apply novel population genetics and statistical genetics methods. Broader impacts involve development of open-source software, undergraduate training in interdisciplinary research, and communication of research findings to the general public as well as government and conservation agencies. The Florida Scrub-Jay is one of the rarest birds in North America, and results from this work promise to inform conservation efforts for this species. Results are also being disseminated via educational outreach activities and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology?s communication outlets to increase public understanding of evolutionary processes operating within populations in ecological time.","puce"

Sediment coring of Lake Junin began in the 1970s; two cores spanning the past 50,000 years reveal that sedimentation has alternated between clastic sediments deposited during peak glacial periods and authigenic calcite (marl) precipitated from the water column during interglacial times. The lake also contains ideal sediments for multiproxy analysis that can be reliably dated using both the radiocarbon and U/Th methods. The oxygen isotopic composition of marl and ostracod carapaces demonstrate that authigenic calcite in Lake Junin primarily records the isotopic composition of precipitation and secondarily the degree of evaporative enrichment of lake water. Lake Junin contains a continuous record of tropical hydroclimate over interglacial and interstadial intervals for much of the past several hundred thousand years that is both comparable to, and an extension of stable isotope records from regional ice cores and speleothems. New organic geochemical proxies compliment the marl isotope record and offer the potential for a truly continuous isotope paleoclimate record through glacial and interglacial intervals alike. Lake Junin is ideally situated, both from logistical and scientific standpoints, to provide continuous high-resolution, independently-dated, long-term records of glaciation, and the variability of phenomena such as ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Because of the strong, demonstrated U/Th dating potential of Junin marl, we will be able to address critical issues regarding the synchrony of climate change in the tropics with that in high latitude regions of both hemispheres, the rate and timing of ecosystem response to climatic perturbations, and the dynamics of the geomagnetic field from a tropical perspective. Lake Junin is a scientifically mature site that will yield critical scientific insights that only drilling coupled with analysis can unlock.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop the first continuous, high-resolution, absolute-dated late Quaternary record of climate change, water balance (P/E), glaciation, vegetation, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the tropical Andes. The well-dated Junin record will allow the team to develop proxy records spanning >200,000yr, which will document the timing of wet/dry cycles, glacial advances/retreats, and the impacts of climatic phenomena such as the changing strength and variability of ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and shifts in the location and range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, this study will provide an opportunity to date (via U-Th) the >40ka sections of both the Titicaca and Sabana de Bogota records through correlation of pollen, stable isotope, and paleomagnetic time series. This study will also enable important insights into the response of tropical vegetation to climate change in the upper Amazon Basin, and will provide a rare southern equatorial perspective on the evolution of Earth?s geomagnetic field.","hot_pink"

This project introduces a new, quantitative approach to model-proxy comparison for application to the new and rapidly developing field of transient climate modeling. The approach expands applicability of model-proxy comparisons to a broader research community and the range of proxy records that can be used in comparison with model results.<br/><br/>Specifically, the work involves a collaborative effort between investigators at Brown University, the University of Wisconsin, and the Institute of Earth's Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Xian. A fully-coupled climate model (Community Climate System Model-version 3; CCSM3) will be run in time-dependent mode using accelerated insolation forcing in order to simulate the evolution of climate during two key intervals in Earth history, the past 300,000 years (a time of high-amplitude climate variability related to changing greenhouse gases, polar ice sheets and sea level) and 3.142 to 2.842 million years ago (an interval of time with the same insolation forcing but much smaller amplitude changes in greenhouse gases, ice sheets, and sea level). These two model experiments and their component forcings will be compared to one another to study the sensitivity of the model-produced climate to changing ice volume and greenhouse gases with an emphasis on tropical surface temperatures and monsoonal circulation. The model results will also be compared to previously published records of surface temperature and monsoonal circulation from marine and terrestrial geological archives. This comparison will focus specifically on the timing (phase) of changes in surface temperature and monsoonal circulation relative to changes in insolation (orbital), ice volume and greenhouse gases. This focus on comparing the phase of the climate response in the model and proxy records leverages the fact that phase is a robust metric that can be quantified from a wide range of proxies. Successful model-proxy comparisons serve to validate model reliability and promote confidence in the use of models for identifying the underlying physics of climate change. <br/><br/>Model results will be widely available and archived at the NOAA/NCDC World Data Center. Funding supports a full time graduate student at Brown University, who will work closely with a full time post-doctoral researcher at CAS (no cost to this project). This interaction will ensure an in-depth experience in climate modeling for the student and experience in geological proxy generation and analysis for the post-doctoral researcher. Fostering this close collaborative approach, including oversight and scientific leadership by the senior researchers, is crucial to furthering the synergistic integration of researchers from these two fields.","lavender"

Yet, less than 8% of those experiencing sexual victimization during incarceration report it to correctional authorities. This project addresses the question, what are the predictors of reporting and do they differ based on the reporting mechanism? <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to provide relevant social science evidence that will inform both legal policies and institutional practices by: 1) assessing the processes and outcomes associated with reporting externally and pursuing litigation; 2) identifying and understanding the individual- and system-level factors that influence prison reporting; and, 3) assessing processes and case outcomes for those who did report to prison authorities. Data to be analyzed are from 474 women, and their legal files, involved in a class action suit based upon experiences of sexual victimization during incarceration. Multiple methods will be used to understand decisions regarding reporting including the barriers, consequences, and benefits, including a survey, review/analysis of archival legal data, case review, and process mapping. The archival review design is advantageous in that it allows for the collection of victimization information without re-traumatizing or endangering vulnerable individuals, maximizes partnerships between social science researchers and legal practitioners, and uses existing data that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain. The ecological framework underlying this research incorporates various levels of social ecology (individual, micro, meso, macro), providing theory that illuminates individual level behavior, as well as the unique aspects of the prison system and policy that inform institutional practices. Examining the processes and outcomes of both internal and external reporting mechanisms can assist prisons nationally in assessing their own institutional practices toward sexual victimization, potentially reducing risk and costs.","crimson"

The program will center on the infusion of quantitative skills development in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) spanning an undergraduate curriculum that addresses data intensive challenges in Arctic ecosystem ecology. Using legacy and recent Arctic data resources for the Barrow area in northernmost Alaska, together with field experiences and lab-based manipulations, the PIs will orchestrate authentic, collaborative research experiences, where students will develop research questions, collect, analyze, and synthesize data, and communicate results in scientifically valid venues on topics that have yet to be investigated. This proposal builds on the PIs prior success with both International Polar Year funding for a program that took underserved students to Antarctica (PLR 0632360), funding for undergraduate cyberinfrastructure training (DUE 0733055), and funding for a GK-12 program (DGE 0947993). <br/><br/>A series of novel and vertically integrated CUREs will be designed that are: i) implemented in both lower and upper-division courses; b) focused in the area of data-intensive ecosystem ecology; and c) constructed in a manner intended to enhance students' cognitive and non-cognitive attributes.

Learning is one of the most important and fundamental lifelong endeavors. A well-educated public is crucial for maintaining a healthy, prosperous, and innovative society. Regardless of subject, one-on-one tutoring is the most personal and effective way to learn. Although recent efforts such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are scaling up access to lectures and other educational materials, it is hard to scale up one-on-one tutoring to online settings because there are far more learners in the world than qualified expert tutors. Access to free online tutors will especially benefit lower-income learners, who are more likely to be from rural areas or underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this project is to investigate how to scale up peer tutoring of computer programming through user interfaces and algorithms for matching learners with tutors, hosting tutoring sessions within real-time code visualizations, and reviewing archived sessions. The central idea is to draw from the large pool of learners concurrently accessing online educational resources to serve as peer tutors for one another. Although peers lack the deep expertise of experts, many are effective tutors since they recently learned the material and can empathize better with learners. This project will build upon Online Python Tutor, a Web-based educational tool that the researcher created to visualize the execution of computer code, now one of the most popular websites for learning programming in the Python language. This project's specific aims are to build a peer tutoring system atop the Online Python Tutor website and to use it to study online peer tutoring interactions. The system has two main components: 1.) PythonLive is a real-time tutoring interface for computer programming that enables multiple users to concurrently write, execute, visualize, and chat about code, a single tutor to effectively handle multiple simultaneous tutees, and offline learning by reviewing archived tutoring sessions. 2.) TutorMatch is an interface that uses crowdsourcing and machine learning to connect learners with appropriately-skilled peer tutors in real-time. In sum, this research will contribute new software-based techniques to facilitate peer tutoring of computer programming, which draws upon and contributes to the fields of human-computer interaction, social computing, and computer-supported cooperative learning.","indigo"

The project partnership includes scientists at three research centers, education researchers, and middle school teachers. The completed curriculum will provide opportunities for middle school students and teachers to compare their locally collected data with historic data to create unique and powerful learning opportunities. The collaboration between scientists and schools introduces middle school students to local, community citizen science endeavors with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>The project is innovative in linking direct exploration of current, local conditions with archived data to examine long-term changes in natural phenomena that cannot be directly perceived.

Paradoxically, the fact that search engines do this well means that there are many collections that can't be searched. Citizens can not yet search some government records because of intermixed information that may need to be protected. Scholars are not yet allowed to see much of the growing backlog of unprocessed archival collections for similar reasons. These limitations, and many more, are direct consequences of the fact that current search engines can only protect sensitive content if that sensitive content has been marked in advance. As the volume of digital content continues to increase, current approaches based on manually finding and marking all of the sensitive content in a collection simply cannot affordably accommodate the scale of the challenge. This project will address that challenge by creating a new class of search algorithms that are designed to balance the searcher's interest in finding relevant content with the content provider's interest in protecting sensitive content. This technology will benefit society by dramatically altering the way we approach challenges such as government transparency, personal and enterprise information management, civil litigation and regulatory investigations, and scholarly access to archival materials.<br/><br/>The project will leverage evaluation-driven information retrieval techniques to optimize a unified objective function that balances the value of finding relevant content with the imperative to protect sensitive information. This will require developing a new class of evaluation measures that are sensitive to both value (relevance) and cost (sensitivity). Factorial vignette survey techniques will be used to elicit the context-appropriate balance of access and restriction for representative applications. The survey results will then be used to inform the design of the feature sets on which evaluation-driven information retrieval techniques depend. Initial experiments will be conducted in protected environments, both locally and as shared-task evaluations on collections that can be licensed for research use under terms that preclude inappropriate disclosure. Ultimately, the project seeks to develop a process for evaluating algorithms for search among sensitive content using an algorithm deposit model in which the executable search algorithm is sent to the protected data, and only manually vetted evaluation results will be returned to participants.","indigo"

We now know individuals may benefit from cooperation in several ways, but mechanisms underlying decisions to cooperate and variation in the amount of cooperation remain incompletely understood. The lance-tailed manakin provides an excellent opportunity to investigate why individuals vary in cooperative behavior, and how cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors coexist. Males of this tropical bird cooperate with non-relatives in coordinated courtship displays, but only dominant alphas mate. Some males serve long terms (6+ years) as non-breeding betas, while others become alphas without ever being betas. Both highly cooperative and non-cooperative males breed once alpha, but males cooperating for the average number of years have low alpha success. This project will assess the role of territory quality, genetic variability, phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategies on beta male behavior. Undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral trainees will all be involved in lab and field work in the U.S. and Panama. This work integrates research and education by (1) implementing an international field course for undergraduates that combines involvement in long-term research with student-designed projects; (2) hosting three undergraduates for REU projects in Panama; (3) developing outreach exercises for 4th-6th graders; (4) publishing educational resources and establishing an associated webcam; and (5) establishing an educational display on the field site, visited by 8000-10,000 tourists/yr. <br/><br/>This project investigates mechanisms underlying behavioral variation in cooperation in the lance-tailed manakin. It assesses the role of ecological constraints, experimentally quantifying effects of territory quality on beta behavior, and tests three complementary hypotheses explaining the occurrence of disruptive selection: genetic variability, phenotypic plasticity, and bet-hedging in unpredictable environments. The project quantifies additive genetic variance in cooperation using animal models on behavioral histories of pedigreed males. Effects of individual phenotype on life history and cooperation are investigated by measuring the relationships of condition, stress responsiveness, and telomeres (repeated nucleotides on chromosome ends, implicated as bioindicators of physiological state). Measures of lifetime siring success will yield insights about whether cooperators reduce variance in lifetime reproductive output. The project will train one postdoctoral researcher, at least one graduate student, and 15 postgraduates in field, laboratory, and analytical techniques. This project provides insight into both the function of cooperation by delayed direct benefits and the forces underlying disruptive selection on behavioral phenotypes. All data from the study will be archived at the Florida State University, and metadata associated with publications will be archived on Dryad.org. Databases will furthermore be accessible through a data repository held at the Smithsonian developed as part of the Manakin Research Coordination Network.","teal"

The neural and hormonal basis of avian parental care is not well understood, especially in the many birds where young are raised by both mothers and fathers working together. The hormone prolactin has a well-established role in maternal care in mammals, and so prolactin and its brain receptors are a promising candidate mechanism of parental care to investigate in birds. The goal of this research is to experimentally test for a causal role of prolactin in promoting the onset of parental behavior in a biparental songbird, the zebra finch. This research will provide new insight into the mechanisms of avian parental care, allowing the integration of this important group into the comparative framework that will provide the predictive power for understanding how these mechanisms may function and evolve in other animals, including humans.

Parental behavior will be recorded in the nests with small video cameras. To confirm that the treatments have the predicted effect on PRL concentrations, plasma will be assayed before and after treatment using a validated ELISA.

Maintaining these cool sea surface temperatures requires a combination of subsurface mixing or lateral/vertical advection to transport surface heat downward. Whether mixing plays the dominant role is not yet clear, but it has been established that a rich set of fluid dynamical processes in the upper equatorial ocean drives intense turbulence. Evidence from limited observations on the Equator at 140W during the passage a Tropical Instability Wave (TIW) revealed a ten-fold increase in subsurface turbulent heat flux, sufficient to cool surface waters by 2 degree Celsius per month. This suggests the possibility that mixing alone could maintain the equatorial cold tongue, a conjecture supported by climatological evidence that sea surface cooling is enhanced by Tropical Instability Waves.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Since 2005, moored mixing measurements on the Equator at 140W using a novel self-contained instrument (chi-pod) provide a more complete temporal assessment of the mixing. These moored records indicate not only considerable variability on short time scales but also significant seasonal variations in turbulence levels that are roughly 90-180ï¿½ out-of-phase with the annual cycle in Sea Surface Temperature. However, the time-varying part of the spatial structure is completely unknown. Strong cross-equatorial gradients in currents, temperature and salinity imply that gradients in mixing are likely to be strong as well. At present, it is impossible to distinguish temporal cycles from spatial gradients.<br/><br/>This project will expand the measurements of mixing on the Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean mooring array along the equator between 140W and 95W. Each of these 4 moorings will be outfitted with 5 chi-pods and the analysis of the data obtained from these moorings will be supplemented by existing data from past process experiments at 140W and a detailed, complementary process experiment at 102.5W. The main goals of he project are to quantify (1) the time- and spatially-varying structure of mixing along and across the cold tongue; (2) the role of mixing in maintaining the cold tongue; (3) the role of TIWs in equatorial mixing; and (4) the role of turbulence in consuming TIW energy.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: A post-doctoral associate will participate in a broad analysis of the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array and mixing measurements and be trained in equatorial dynamics. College graduate students will participate in the process experiment. Undergraduate engineering students will be employed in the summer months to help with both electronics and mechanical construction and testing of instrumentation. An undergraduate atmospheric science student will be employed in the summer of 2013 to review and document archived data from the Mary's Peak webcam (http://marycam.coas.oregonstate.edu/index.html) for public dissemination.<br/><br/>This project complements ongoing theoretical analyses of Tropical Instability Waves conducted by the lead investigators and several colleagues. Data obtained in the project will be shared with the Climate Process Team on ocean mixing and become part of the archived data sets of the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Array Program managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Currently there are about 1,150 described species, with new ones being discovered annually. They have sausage-shaped bodies, with 8 legs ending in long claws. Water bears are unique because they can enter a state of 'suspended life' called cryptobiosis as their habitat dries out. In this stage, they can tolerate extreme conditions of cold, heat, vacuum, and pressure. Water bears may remain in this condition for many years until moisture returns allowing them to continue on with their lives. For a long time few scientists studied tardigrades because they were thought to have little economic or health value that were important to humans. However, their ability to suspend life is now being studied as a way to extend the 'shelf life' of organs harvested for transplant. It has also been discovered that in this suspended state water bears may be dispersed by wind carrying plant disease-causing bacteria, and that as a result they may be responsible for the spread of some crop diseases. The medical and industrial applications of this biology plus the disease issues make it critical to understand the global distribution of water bear species and to develop an up-to-date taxonomic framework to facilitate this work. <br/><br/>Water bear research necessarily starts with museum collections. The largest North American collection is housed in the Bohart Museum of Entomology. Most of this 35,000 slide collection was acquired in the 1960-70s, and was prepared according to the best practices of the time. Unfortunately, best practices of the time meant using non-archival mounting media, which degrades over time. As a result the specimens are rapidly deteriorating. In addition, the taxonomy of the specimens has not been updated since the 1970's and they have not been databased. To address these issues, this project seeks to stabilize, repair and restore the specimens mounting them in archival quality media, image each specimen and upload the images and associated metadata on-line and integrate all data with iDigBio. The project will also train undergraduates at Fresno City College and UC Davis in the processes of preparation, repair, documentation, and data entry of large-scale collections. Initially, type and voucher specimens will be remounted - after the process has been perfected with duplicate specimens of non-type material - following lessons learned during a similar project on another group of arthropods, parasitoid wasps.

This research proposes to examine the relationship between collective consciousness and important forms of resistance between the years 1750 and 1791. The project addresses the following questions. What was the role of Africa-inspired rituals in shaping collective consciousness? How did this collective consciousness influence patterns of escape from enslavement? How and why did patterns of escape from enslavement change over time and space in the few decades before the Haitian Revolution?<br/><br/>Preliminary results suggest the following hypotheses. First, Africa-inspired ritual events were gathering spaces for rebels to raise oppositional consciousness, campaign for freedom, and mobilize recruits. Second, runaways' social ties, knowledge of specific destinations, self-assertive behaviors, and longer durations of escape seem to be reasonable indicators of an oppositional consciousness. Third, runaways strategically responded to structural and environmental windows of opportunity (such as natural disasters, changes in colonial law, and geographic proximity to isolated zones). To test these hypotheses, the Co-PI will perform (a) qualitative and quantitative content analysis of over 11,000 digitally archived Haitian runaway slave advertisements; (b) a systematic review of primary documents held in several key archives in the Americas and Europe; (c) a systematic review of critical secondary sources published during and since the period of study; and (c) qualitative field research in present-day Haiti. The findings on antecedents to the Haitian Revolution will improve our understanding of the role of shared consciousness, social ties and networks, and human cultural expressions in collective action processes.","crimson"

This collection includes large historical holdings from areas that have undergone drastic environmental change or may face important change in the future. Recent research citing the collection exemplifies how new and unpredicted scientific paradigms, environmental issues, and technological advances require the existence of extensive and accessible historical scientific collections. Genetics, molecular phylogenetics, museomics, biomechanics, global change, emerging diseases, and invasive species are research areas for which specimens from this collection have recently been used. Based on recommendations from recent assessments that identified a number of urgent challenges affecting the collection and its related data, Carnegie Museum of Natural History has developed an extensive plan to preserve and increase access to the collection, ensuring that this important resource is sustained and able to support research for generations to come. <br/><br/>Ranking tenth among US collections of its kind, the Herpetology Collection at Carnegie Museum of Natural History spans more than 100 years of scientific collecting in 170 countries. It includes 148 holotypes and 2,007 paratypes (specimens of special scientific and historic significance used in the original species descriptions), specimens of six extinct and 78 critically endangered species, and one of the world's largest turtle collections. Through this award, Carnegie Museum of Natural History will: a) optimize storage space to improve curation and access and mitigate preservation risks due to overcrowding and suboptimal containers; b) digitize vouchered archival data related to specific specimens, providing vital context for the collection; c) accession and catalog ca. 12,000 specimens, georeference locality data, and make data and images of holotypes and paratypes digitally accessible; d) update taxonomy throughout the Section and reorganize the collection accordingly; e) enhance the public's appreciation of the value of collections and research by developing new collections-based programs and exhibits. Ensuring the long-term preservation and availability of the Section's specimens and related data is key for supporting future research efforts. Likewise, digitizing important archival records will expand the relevance of the collection for studies in ecology, systematics, conservation, and the history of natural history collections. Updating taxonomy and georeferencing additional records will enhance the precision of biodiversity data, improving usefulness to the global research community. In addition, collaborative planning will lead to the implementation of new educational programming and two new museum exhibits designed to enhance the public's appreciation of the value of collections for research and increase understanding of the collection's importance in the public's day-to-day life. Project results are available on line (www.carnegiemnh.org/projects/alcohol-house), and data will be shared and made available through iDigBio (www.idigbio.org), VertNet, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF).","puce"

Growth of the ice sheets transferred water from the ocean to the continents and caused sea level to drop by nearly 400 feet. While it has long been known that the pacing of the ice ages is related to changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun, the triggering mechanism for the end ice ages, known as terminations, has yet to be fully explained. Lowering of sea level releases pressure on the global mid-ocean ridge system, a nearly continuous chain of submerged volcanoes that span 30,000 miles of the sea floor. The pressure release should drive enhanced submarine volcanism, which may in turn influence climate by introducing heat and carbon dioxide into the deep ocean. The aim of the proposed work is to assess magmatism along mid-ocean ridges in the eastern South Pacific using geologic archives of volcanic activity. Sediment cores retrieved from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and Pacific Antarctic Ridge (PAR) will be used to assess hydrothermal plume activity near the ridge crest. Hydrothermal plumes are created through superheating of cold deep ocean water by hot oceanic crust, which is itself heated by magma. Thus, sedimentary archives can be used to assess glacial-interglacial changes in magmatism and test whether enhanced submarine volcanism occurs during glacial terminations. <br/><br/>The proposed work will focus on a series of cores from 10ï¿½S to 40ï¿½S along the EPR and PAR. Preliminary oxygen isotope data indicates that sediments in this region accumulate at a rate sufficient to constrain glacial-interglacial timescales. Hydrothermal activity will be inferred by estimating the flux of Fe, Mn, V, and As to ridge crest sediments. All fluxes will be constrained using the 3He normalization technique. A finding of coherent variations in metal flux at multiple sites would indicate there were regional changes in magmatic activity. Additionally, the timing of anomalous metal fluxes will be compared with climate proxies to assess the feasibility that mid-ocean ridge magmatism acts as a negative feedback on ice sheet size. Finally, a petrologic model will be used to simulate the impact of sea level variations on CO2-bearing melt production in the upper mantle. Simulations of carbon flux from the global mid-ocean ridge system will be used to assess whether variations in carbon flux could have feasibly driven atmospheric CO2 on glacial-interglacial timescales. <br/><br/>The proposed work could transform our understanding of the climate system by constraining the interactions between the fluid and solid earth on glacial-interglacial timescales. The broader educational impacts of the proposed work includes the participation of a postdoctoral scholar and two undergraduates at the University of Connecticut, plus an additional undergraduate at Caltech.","lavender"

This is often a result of differences in behavior, such as when females of two species differ in their preferences for particular mates. These preferences can be highly sensitive to changes in the environment. The aim of this study is to discover how female preferences in swordtail fish are affected by different environmental factors. This study is among the first to attempt to assess how the environment affects the molecular basis of sensory perception and mating behavior. Furthermore, this study will shed light on how environmental conditions can promote interbreeding and therefore affect how species split apart and come together. Throughout the course of this study, the researchers will train undergraduate students at Texas A&M as well as local students from Calnali, Mexico. These students will help in conducting experiments, thereby receiving a firsthand experience with research and becoming well-rounded scientists. This training will increase interest in ecology an evolutionary biology and, in the case of Calnali, will create exemplary scientists in a region where there are few.<br/><br/>Specifically, the researchers will use the swordtail fish Xiphophorus birchmanni to determine which genes in the brain and sensory tissue are sensitive to changes in female diet and her social environment, and how these environmental factors affect female preference for males of the same species. Newborn swordtails will be submitted to one of three social treatments (raised with adult conspecifics, adult heterospecific Xiphophorus malinche, or no adult exposure) and one of two diet treatments, varying in protein content, which has been shown to affect the strength of female swordtail preference. Upon maturation, female preference for conspecific versus heterospecific male odors will be assessed using a dichotomous mate choice assay. Female brains and olfactory epithelia will then be dissected and undergo RNA-Seq analyses to quantify gene expression. The researchers will then use in situ hybridization on candidate genes found from RNA-Seq to identify where these genes are expressed and therefore what brain regions are implicated in female mate choice.

This project will unify the storage system onto a single standard, and move specimens to storage cabinets that are more protective - that is, built using archival materials and properly sealed from environmental elements and museum pests. Specimens will be imaged and their collected event data entered into a publically-accessible digital database.

Despite their extensive use in research and substantial investment in this resource by the University, the collection suffers from poor storage conditions, evident from an abundance of inadequate specimen cases, and the absence of a modern, accessible database. The activities proposed in this project are designed to remedy these problems by: replacing all specimen cabinets with a purpose-built archival system, increasing storage space, reorganizing the slide-mounted and ethanol-preserved specimens into appropriate storage, and setting up a Web-accessible specimen database. The data will be further disseminated through InvertNet and iDigBio. The database avails Frost Museum data for public data mining and fundamental research in areas such as epidemiology, invasive species biology, global climate change, pollinator declines, and the evolutionary history of insect lineages.

Over the past several decades paleoclimatologists have developed myriad proxy indicators of past regional climate that are recorded in natural archives such as ice cores, cave deposits, and lake sediment, among many other archives. Proxy paleoclimate records from the tropics are particularly important because this region is the ?heat engine? of Earth. Long- and short-term changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation that are manifested in such phenomenon as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the response of the tropics to high latitude climatic ?events? are critical to understand because these phenomena can have a profound impact on regional water balance, which directly affects potable water supplies, hydroelectricity generation, and agricultural productivity. <br/> The longest continuous records of climate change in the tropics are limited to those derived from the relatively few old lake basins in the region. Lake Junin, the largest lake located entirely within Peru, is among the oldest lake basins in South America. It contains a sediment record that is at least 200 m long that may extend more than 250,000 years. Lake Junin is exceptional in the length of record that it contains, but also in the climate signals that it records. Considerable prior research has documented that Lake Junin records the waxing and waning of nearby alpine glaciers and changes in regional water balance through the isotope geochemistry of calcium carbonate deposited on the lake bottom at a rate of approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr. This research will develop these and other proxy climate records for the full length of recovered core; the records generated will comprise one of the longest continuous records of climate and environmental change from the inner tropics. <br/> The Lake Junin Drilling Project has several broader impacts. These include the joint renovation of an abandoned lodge for future shared use as the first shoreline outpost for officials of the Junin National Reserve, as a visitor center, and as a lake access point for ecotourism. Capacity building activities in the Junin Project include collaboration with Peruvian universities, training of geoscientists, as well as Peruvian and American student training. A specific team will be responsible for the organization of lectures at villages in the region to inform citizens about the significance of the drilling, and will work closely with the national park service to instruct the rangers on how to use the science to promote conservation efforts around the lake. During the drilling, a team will facilitate interactions with local and international media. The team expect to involve U.S. and Peruvian students in all aspects of Junin drilling, and much of the paleoecological research related to the Junin cores will be conducted by graduate students. Training opportunities during the drilling phase of operations are also planned for geoscientists from Peruvian universities. Numerous U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow will be involved in all phases of the proposed research. The material collected during this project will set the stage for significant future research. LacCore, the National Lacustrine Core Facility at the University of Minnesota, will facilitate this by overseeing the long-term storage, curation, and access to data and samples obtained in this project.<br/><br/>Technical Explanation<br/> Lake Junin, located at 4000 m asl in the inner-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, is a prime target for drilling because it contains a thick (>200 m) sediment package deposited at a high rate (0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr). Abundant research conducted on and around Lake Junin provides a compelling rationale for deep drilling. Moraine mapping coupled with cosmogenic radionuclide dating indicate that paleoglaciers reached the lake edge, but have not overridden the lake in as much as one million years. Lake Junin is one of the few lakes in the tropical Andes that predates the maximum extent of glaciation and is in a geomorphic position to record the waxing and waning of glaciers in nearby cordillera. Sediment coring of Lake Junin began in the 1970s; two cores spanning the past 50,000 years reveal that sedimentation has alternated between clastic sediments deposited during peak glacial periods and authigenic calcite (marl) precipitated from the water column during interglacial times. The lake also contains ideal sediments for multiproxy analysis that can be reliably dated using both the radiocarbon and U/Th methods. The oxygen isotopic composition of marl and ostracod carapaces demonstrate that authigenic calcite in Lake Junin primarily records the isotopic composition of precipitation and secondarily the degree of evaporative enrichment of lake water. Lake Junin contains a continuous record of tropical hydroclimate over interglacial and interstadial intervals for much of the past several hundred thousand years that is both comparable to, and an extension of stable isotope records from regional ice cores and speleothems. New organic geochemical proxies compliment the marl isotope record and offer the potential for a truly continuous isotope paleoclimate record through glacial and interglacial intervals alike. Lake Junin is ideally situated, both from logistical and scientific standpoints, to provide continuous high-resolution, independently-dated, long-term records of glaciation, and the variability of phenomena such as ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Because of the strong, demonstrated U/Th dating potential of Junin marl, we will be able to address critical issues regarding the synchrony of climate change in the tropics with that in high latitude regions of both hemispheres, the rate and timing of ecosystem response to climatic perturbations, and the dynamics of the geomagnetic field from a tropical perspective. Lake Junin is a scientifically mature site that will yield critical scientific insights that only drilling coupled with analysis can unlock.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop the first continuous, high-resolution, absolute-dated late Quaternary record of climate change, water balance (P/E), glaciation, vegetation, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the tropical Andes. The well-dated Junin record will allow the team to develop proxy records spanning >200,000yr, which will document the timing of wet/dry cycles, glacial advances/retreats, and the impacts of climatic phenomena such as the changing strength and variability of ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and shifts in the location and range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, this study will provide an opportunity to date (via U-Th) the >40ka sections of both the Titicaca and Sabana de Bogota records through correlation of pollen, stable isotope, and paleomagnetic time series. This study will also enable important insights into the response of tropical vegetation to climate change in the upper Amazon Basin, and will provide a rare southern equatorial perspective on the evolution of Earth?s geomagnetic field.","hot_pink"

At the interface between the subducting plate and the mantle significant heat transfer and physical and chemical exchange occur. To better understand how crustal and mantle materials move and interact within subduction zones, it is critically important to study rocks exhumed from this process. The proposed work will constrain how material moves within subduction zones by determining the temperature and pressure histories that these exhumed rocks experienced while in the subduction zone itself. For this work the principle investigators will analyze the chemical composition of the minerals rutile and titanite in rocks from a classic subduction locality, the Catalina Schist of southern California. They will then compare the recorded histories with histories predicted by different models for material behavior within subduction zones. In addition to the scientific goals of the project, this award is supporting the eduction of graduate and undergraduate students in an STEM discipline, is contributing to broadening of underrepresented groups in science, and the development of undergraduate course curricula in mineralogy and petrology. The project is facilitating a new collaboration between the partnering institutions involved in this effort, and is contributing direct exchange of scientific methods and analytical standards between trace element/geochronology laboratories. The results that derive from this project are being disseminated to the scientific community through research publications and presentations, and the data are being archived in appropriate community databases. <br/><br/>This project will exploit new developments in thermobarometry and geochronology to better understand subduction zone tectonics, using exposures of Catalina Schist on Santa Catalina Island, California, as a type example. The work will provide new, high-precision Pressure-Temperature-time (P-T-t) constraints that critically test tectonic models with unprecedented geographic scope and precision. The proposed research addresses broad geodynamic questions, e.g. to what degree does flow in the subduction channel change temporally and affect subduction thermal evolution? In addition, the principle investigators will continue to develop petrologic and chronologic tools that broadly advance petrogenetic research in other fields. This research will address two main issues in the tectonic evolution of subduction zones: (1) What is the scale of melange flow as melange matrix progressively metamorphoses? (2) What tectonic processes produced distinctive high-Temperature subduction-related rocks? Numerous different models have been generally proposed. Four basic sets of data will be collected: (1) Samples will be collected over a well-mapped area of melange and along three key transects. (2) Electron microprobe analysis will provide Pressure-Time estimates and identify specific titanite and rutile grains and domains for trace element analysis. (3) Laser-ablation Inductively-coupled-mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) on a sub-grain scale (50-100 micron spots) will constrain temperature and time, respectively. (4) Raman spectroscopy of mineral inclusions will constrain entrapment pressures on the prograde Pressure-Temperature path. The resulting data will be used to test tectonic models by characterizing the degree of Pressure-Temperature-time homogeneity (scale of mixing) within a melange zone and Pressure-Temperature-time trends across structure. All data will be permanently archived with MetPetDB.","hot_pink"

Because of the strong, demonstrated U/Th dating potential of Junin marl, we will be able to address critical issues regarding the synchrony of climate change in the tropics with that in high latitude regions of both hemispheres, the rate and timing of ecosystem response to climatic perturbations, and the dynamics of the geomagnetic field from a tropical perspective. Lake Junin is a scientifically mature site that will yield critical scientific insights that only drilling coupled with analysis can unlock.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop the first continuous, high-resolution, absolute-dated late Quaternary record of climate change, water balance (P/E), glaciation, vegetation, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the tropical Andes. The well-dated Junin record will allow the team to develop proxy records spanning >200,000yr, which will document the timing of wet/dry cycles, glacial advances/retreats, and the impacts of climatic phenomena such as the changing strength and variability of ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and shifts in the location and range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, this study will provide an opportunity to date (via U-Th) the >40ka sections of both the Titicaca and Sabana de Bogota records through correlation of pollen, stable isotope, and paleomagnetic time series. This study will also enable important insights into the response of tropical vegetation to climate change in the upper Amazon Basin, and will provide a rare southern equatorial perspective on the evolution of Earth?s geomagnetic field.","hot_pink"

Over the past several decades paleoclimatologists have developed myriad proxy indicators of past regional climate that are recorded in natural archives such as ice cores, cave deposits, and lake sediment, among many other archives. Proxy paleoclimate records from the tropics are particularly important because this region is the ?heat engine? of Earth. Long- and short-term changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation that are manifested in such phenomenon as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the response of the tropics to high latitude climatic ?events? are critical to understand because these phenomena can have a profound impact on regional water balance, which directly affects potable water supplies, hydroelectricity generation, and agricultural productivity. <br/> The longest continuous records of climate change in the tropics are limited to those derived from the relatively few old lake basins in the region. Lake Junin, the largest lake located entirely within Peru, is among the oldest lake basins in South America. It contains a sediment record that is at least 200 m long that may extend more than 250,000 years. Lake Junin is exceptional in the length of record that it contains, but also in the climate signals that it records. Considerable prior research has documented that Lake Junin records the waxing and waning of nearby alpine glaciers and changes in regional water balance through the isotope geochemistry of calcium carbonate deposited on the lake bottom at a rate of approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr. This research will develop these and other proxy climate records for the full length of recovered core; the records generated will comprise one of the longest continuous records of climate and environmental change from the inner tropics. <br/> The Lake Junin Drilling Project has several broader impacts. These include the joint renovation of an abandoned lodge for future shared use as the first shoreline outpost for officials of the Junin National Reserve, as a visitor center, and as a lake access point for ecotourism. Capacity building activities in the Junin Project include collaboration with Peruvian universities, training of geoscientists, as well as Peruvian and American student training. A specific team will be responsible for the organization of lectures at villages in the region to inform citizens about the significance of the drilling, and will work closely with the national park service to instruct the rangers on how to use the science to promote conservation efforts around the lake. During the drilling, a team will facilitate interactions with local and international media. The team expect to involve U.S. and Peruvian students in all aspects of Junin drilling, and much of the paleoecological research related to the Junin cores will be conducted by graduate students. Training opportunities during the drilling phase of operations are also planned for geoscientists from Peruvian universities. Numerous U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow will be involved in all phases of the proposed research. The material collected during this project will set the stage for significant future research. LacCore, the National Lacustrine Core Facility at the University of Minnesota, will facilitate this by overseeing the long-term storage, curation, and access to data and samples obtained in this project.<br/><br/>Technical Explanation<br/> Lake Junin, located at 4000 m asl in the inner-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, is a prime target for drilling because it contains a thick (>200 m) sediment package deposited at a high rate (0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr). Abundant research conducted on and around Lake Junin provides a compelling rationale for deep drilling. Moraine mapping coupled with cosmogenic radionuclide dating indicate that paleoglaciers reached the lake edge, but have not overridden the lake in as much as one million years. Lake Junin is one of the few lakes in the tropical Andes that predates the maximum extent of glaciation and is in a geomorphic position to record the waxing and waning of glaciers in nearby cordillera. Sediment coring of Lake Junin began in the 1970s; two cores spanning the past 50,000 years reveal that sedimentation has alternated between clastic sediments deposited during peak glacial periods and authigenic calcite (marl) precipitated from the water column during interglacial times. The lake also contains ideal sediments for multiproxy analysis that can be reliably dated using both the radiocarbon and U/Th methods. The oxygen isotopic composition of marl and ostracod carapaces demonstrate that authigenic calcite in Lake Junin primarily records the isotopic composition of precipitation and secondarily the degree of evaporative enrichment of lake water. Lake Junin contains a continuous record of tropical hydroclimate over interglacial and interstadial intervals for much of the past several hundred thousand years that is both comparable to, and an extension of stable isotope records from regional ice cores and speleothems. New organic geochemical proxies compliment the marl isotope record and offer the potential for a truly continuous isotope paleoclimate record through glacial and interglacial intervals alike. Lake Junin is ideally situated, both from logistical and scientific standpoints, to provide continuous high-resolution, independently-dated, long-term records of glaciation, and the variability of phenomena such as ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone.

This collaborative interdisciplinary research project aims to consolidate, into a single user-friendly database, information about volcanic products detected in Antarctica. By consolidating information about volcanic sources, and physical and geochemical characteristics of volcanic products, this systematic data collection approach will improve the ability of researchers to identify volcanic ash, or tephra, from specific volcanic eruptions that may be spread over large areas in a geologically instantaneous amount of time. Development of this database will assist in the identification and cross-correlation of time intervals in various paleoclimate archives that contain volcanic layers from often unknown sources. The AntT project relies on a cyberinfrastructure framework developed in house through NSF funded CDI-Type I: CiiWork for data assimilation, interpretation and open distribution model. In addition to collection and integration of existing information about volcanic products, this project will focus on filling the information gaps about unique physico-chemical characteristics of very fine (<3 micrometer) volcanic particles (cryptotephra) that are present in Antarctic ice cores. This component of research will involve improving analytical methodology for detecting cryptotephra layers in ice, and will train a new generation of scientists to apply an array of modern state?of?the-art instrumentation available to the project team. <br/><br/>The recognized importance of tephra in establishing a chronological framework for volcanic and sedimentary successions has already resulted in the development of robust regional tephrochronological frameworks (e.g. Europe, Kamchatka, New Zealand, Western North America). The AntT project will provide this framework for Antarctic tephrochronology, as needed for precise correlation records between Antarctic ice cores (e.g. WAIS Divide, RICE, ITASE) and global paleoclimate archives. The results of AntT will be of particular significance to climatologists, paleoclimatologists, atmospheric chemists, geochemists, climate modelers, solar-terrestrial physicists, environmental statisticians, and policy makers for designing solutions to mitigate or cope with likely future impacts of climate change events on modern society.","plum"

Very young fossil records ? that is, skeletal remains from the last few decades, centuries, and tens of millennia, embedded within the upper few meters of the sedimentary record ? offer a promising means both of reconstructing changes in ecosystems over the full history of cultural/industrial development and of acquiring the information on truly natural conditions that is essential to developing restoration targets. However, to confidently merge these geologically young paleontological data with conventional neo-biological data, we need to understand how, if at all, biological information is altered with the progressive, natural burial of shelly remains. Research over the last 20 years finds that molluscan death assemblages (clam and snail shells) present within the uppermost, storm- and animal-stirred few centimeters of the seabed can include some fairly old shells (thousands of years old, especially on open continental shelves), but are strongly dominated by individuals that died during the last (most recent) ?urban? century and especially the last few decades. Death assemblages from this mixed layer are thus clearly time-averaged, but the strongest signal is from the final stages of skeletal accumulation, much like a photographic time-exposure produces a somewhat blurry track of a moving object whose final position is captured with snapshot-like clarity. <br/>Here, with NSF funding, we will test for the first time the extent to which skeletal assemblages retain this level of temporal resolution as they undergo progressive burial into deeper, more permanent layers of the Holocene sedimentary record, where the assemblage is no longer refreshed by new shell input and is subject to different chemical regimes. We will leverage extensive prior knowledge of seafloor animals and environmental conditions on the southern California continental shelf to conduct a series of observational experiments on the key factors thought to control skeletal accumulation, namely (1) the intrinsic durability of shell material (focus on six key genera of bivalves, differing in shell mineralogy and microstructure), (2) rates and types of sediment accumulation (land-derived mud and sand, plus shell-rich seabeds deprived of sediment), and (3) rates and depths of sediment mixing by storms and burrowing animals, with factors 2 and 3 quantified using radioisotopic methods. Shell ages will be based on radiocarbon-calibrated amino-acid racemization dating, which we have already determined works well in this region. Data on how temporal resolution changes with burial will be generated by dating sets of shells from a series of horizons in long (3-4 m) sedimentary cores. We will take these cores at sites both along the known legacy gradient of sediment toxicity from DDT-charged wastewater effluents on the Palos Verdes shelf and from historically uncontaminated seafloors, providing an ?unnatural? experiment on the effects of bioturbation. Using stochastic simulations and likelihood analysis of shell-age frequency distributions as well as conventional statistical analysis of experimental results, this project will identify the dominant mechanisms that determine shell preservation, which is relevant to the ecological fidelity as well as the temporal resolution of skeletal assemblages in both the deep- and near-time fossil records. <br/>Of even broader implications, we will develop and refine protocols for merging biological information from paleontological and neo-biological sources, as part of the burgeoning new field of conservation paleobiology. Research papers will be published in marine biological and pollution journals rather than only earth science journals to promote scientific integration. We already have a cooperative relationship with scientists from several regional agencies charged with environmental management, who will be kept up to date with research results by talks on site. Archived skeletal assemblages from our cores will constitute a new resource for future studies of diverse types (e.g., morphology, sclerochronology, isotopes, molecules), particularly when combined with extensive mixed-layer death assemblages that we have already archived from past (1970s) and ongoing (2003 ? present) surveys and biomonitoring of living shelf communities. The project will provide field and lab experience for a post-doctoral scholar and for undergraduate and graduate student assistants drawn from an historically black institution (Savannah State). We will also develop a lab exercise for use in local high schools and 2-year or 4-year colleges on the historical ecology of the southern California marine bight and the power of sedimentary cores for environmental and ecological analysis. This region has strong public interest and governmental commitment to coastal environmental quality, and thus has a good existing infrastructure for public outreach.","hot_pink"

This project builds on expertise available in the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) community to provide these benefits. The Provenance Aware Synthesis Architecture repository will ensure long-term availability of data and open data access through federations such as DataONE. This system will be expanded in several ways to accommodate a broader community of data providers and users. These enhancements include a scalable user identity management system, improved data documentation procedures to simplify data submission for non-technical users, and expand the data-quality assurance tools to accommodate a broader range of community practices. Training activities will be developed that range from the basics of metadata creation to the adoption of standardized best practices for specific types of data. The development of templates for describing a data lifecycle will accelerate the availability of data for synthesis. The project will leverage the collective experience of the LTER community to improve data management across a broad community through communication and collaboration. It will facilitate shared technology to develop more commonly usable and more efficient approaches to data curation workflows. Participants in training workshops will be trained in developing workflow technology, re-using existing workflows, and archiving and sharing their developments. Through these workshops, together with community-level centers of expertise, and individual-based skill exchanges, the project will increase the volume of data available along with data discoverability and reuse.

Growth of the ice sheets transferred water from the ocean to the continents and caused sea level to drop by nearly 400 feet. While it has long been known that the pacing of the ice ages is related to changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun, the triggering mechanism for the end ice ages, known as terminations, has yet to be fully explained. Lowering of sea level releases pressure on the global mid-ocean ridge system, a nearly continuous chain of submerged volcanoes that span 30,000 miles of the sea floor. The pressure release should drive enhanced submarine volcanism, which may in turn influence climate by introducing heat and carbon dioxide into the deep ocean. The aim of the proposed work is to assess magmatism along mid-ocean ridges in the eastern South Pacific using geologic archives of volcanic activity. Sediment cores retrieved from the East Pacific Rise (EPR) and Pacific Antarctic Ridge (PAR) will be used to assess hydrothermal plume activity near the ridge crest. Hydrothermal plumes are created through superheating of cold deep ocean water by hot oceanic crust, which is itself heated by magma. Thus, sedimentary archives can be used to assess glacial-interglacial changes in magmatism and test whether enhanced submarine volcanism occurs during glacial terminations. <br/><br/>The proposed work will focus on a series of cores from 10ï¿½S to 40ï¿½S along the EPR and PAR. Preliminary oxygen isotope data indicates that sediments in this region accumulate at a rate sufficient to constrain glacial-interglacial timescales. Hydrothermal activity will be inferred by estimating the flux of Fe, Mn, V, and As to ridge crest sediments. All fluxes will be constrained using the 3He normalization technique. A finding of coherent variations in metal flux at multiple sites would indicate there were regional changes in magmatic activity. Additionally, the timing of anomalous metal fluxes will be compared with climate proxies to assess the feasibility that mid-ocean ridge magmatism acts as a negative feedback on ice sheet size. Finally, a petrologic model will be used to simulate the impact of sea level variations on CO2-bearing melt production in the upper mantle. Simulations of carbon flux from the global mid-ocean ridge system will be used to assess whether variations in carbon flux could have feasibly driven atmospheric CO2 on glacial-interglacial timescales. <br/><br/>The proposed work could transform our understanding of the climate system by constraining the interactions between the fluid and solid earth on glacial-interglacial timescales. The broader educational impacts of the proposed work includes the participation of a postdoctoral scholar and two undergraduates at the University of Connecticut, plus an additional undergraduate at Caltech.","lavender"

In most PICUs, a tiny fraction of it is coarsely aggregated and recorded, but surprisingly, most of this data is simply discarded. Even if most or all the data is recorded, its sheer volume simply overwhelms researchers and analysts; very few tools exist to help them make sense of and learn from this data. This currently discarded data is a potential goldmine of actionable knowledge that could improve outcomes (decreased mortality/morbidity, reduce pain, etc.), and reduce costs (implicit in reduced length of stay). However, the very nature of this data - multivariate, heterogeneous, high dimensional, temporal, noisy, biased, and high frequency - poses significant challenges for traditional analytical techniques from statistics and data mining.<br/><br/>In this project, an interdisciplinary team of investigators is developing: (a) xcalable machine learning algorithms for mining archives of annotated PICU data to find regularities and patterns that can be used to aid in diagnostics and prediction of outcomes; and (b) techniques for monitoring ICU telemetry in real time to detect whether the patterns and rules discovered in the offline step have occurred and can be used to guide interventions (actions by the doctor).<br/><br/>The project brings together experts in data mining (Keogh, Tsotras), high performance computing (Najjar), and medicine (Wetzel) to investigate holistic solutions to the above problems. The project contributes to research-based advanced training of graduate and undergraduate students at the University of California Riverside.

What scholars know less about is how indigenous social organizations develop in culturally diverse ways, and what sovereignty means, culturally and morally, within an indigenous context. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, seeks to understand the role of cultural and moral values in organizational development. As a project which employs a collaborative ethnographic approach, engaging Navajo in the gathering and archiving of data, the project would also broaden the participation of an underrepresented group in the sciences.<br/><br/>Teresa Montoya, under the supervision of Dr. Fred Myers of the New York University will conduct a 15-month ethnographic project exploring community political life on the Navajo Nation in two neighboring settlements: Pine Springs, Arizona (Oak Springs Chapter) and Sanders, Arizona (Nahata Dziil Chapter). Specifically, this research examines the correlation between political sovereignty - a legal category established through federal treaty obligations and subsequent acts of legislation - and the cultural ideal of K'e, a Navajo term that emphasizes the moral value of kinship and social organization. Based on preliminary research observing and analyzing local meetings, the researcher hypothesizes that in each location, community members draw upon both cultural and political discourses to support and sustain their organizational efforts. An investigation of the differential employment of these discourses utilizing methods of participant observation, focus groups, and semi-structured interviews allows for a comparative analysis of contemporary Navajo community action. This project brings together insights from current ethnographies addressing kinship and relatedness, critical Indigenous approaches to sovereignty and Navajo subjectivity, and the anthropology of representational politics. Taken together this literature informs the hypothesis that neither the cultural nor the political frame has adequately helped social scientists understand contemporary Navajo community organization. The researcher hypothesizes that community political activity is not limited to official institutional structures and that cultural understandings of K'e cannot be isolated from political ambitions. Methods include the use of interviews, focus groups, and participant observation in the Navajo communities of Pine Springs and Nahata Dziil, as well as targeted archival research and collaborative ethnographic methods with local community organizations. By examining the confluence of social and political discourses of relatedness in everyday Navajo lives, this project offers three major contributions to the discipline of anthropology: (1) it reframes what is often presumed to be an oppositional relationship between the expression of so-called traditional Indigenous values and enactment of political sovereignties; (2) it examines how Navajo people are reworking idioms of relatedness not to return to a prior stable past but to creatively engage with and perhaps challenge unsustainable processes of extraction that target their bodies, histories, and communities; and (3) it explores new developments in Indian Country around the increasingly polysemic and multifarious expressions of sovereignty in tribal and community politics.","maroon"

Standards include uniform systems of weights, measures, timekeeping, electrical units, as well as product specifications governing everything from screw threads to paper sizes. They are quite pervasive but rarely appreciated. The project will begin by exploring the challenges faced by eighteenth and nineteenth-century proponents of standardization. It will also examine how and why the US rejected the metric system, parting ways with many other industrial nations in the nineteenth century, and how and why in the early twentieth century it embarked on a comprehensive campaign of product standardization that earlier metrological reforms made possible. The research focuses on developments prior to the postwar era. This emphasis reflects a conviction that much of the important work of standardization (the precedents, the early governing bodies, and the scientific consensus) was in place by the early decades of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/><br/>A comprehensive history of standards and standardization in America does not exist, despite the pivotal role the US played in promoting and frustrating the adoption of standards. This project promises to remedy this oversight. The PI will dig deeply into archival sources including the records of the Office of Weights and Measures and the Bureau of Standards held at the National Archives; the personal papers of key players in campaigns for and against standardization; and the extensive writings on standardization that appeared in scientific, trade journals, as well as the popular press. Though ostensibly driven by scientific and technological needs, standards have often been proxies for larger conflicts in American society. This project will examine how standards became entangled in political and economic struggles over public policy, the power of government, and national security. The history of standards thus connects the history of science and society in new and novel ways.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>One of the main outcomes of this project will be the publication of a book, which is already under advance publication contract with Harvard. The book will be marketed to both academic and general readers. The PI has an extensive track record of reaching a wider audience. He has written on science, technology, economics, and history in the pages of the New York Times and many other publications. He is well positioned to insure that his research will be read, not only by academics, but by the politicians, policy makers, pundits, and taxpayers who have a stake in contemporary standards and standardization.","crimson"

Over the past several decades paleoclimatologists have developed myriad proxy indicators of past regional climate that are recorded in natural archives such as ice cores, cave deposits, and lake sediment, among many other archives. Proxy paleoclimate records from the tropics are particularly important because this region is the ?heat engine? of Earth. Long- and short-term changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation that are manifested in such phenomenon as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and the response of the tropics to high latitude climatic ?events? are critical to understand because these phenomena can have a profound impact on regional water balance, which directly affects potable water supplies, hydroelectricity generation, and agricultural productivity. <br/> The longest continuous records of climate change in the tropics are limited to those derived from the relatively few old lake basins in the region. Lake Junin, the largest lake located entirely within Peru, is among the oldest lake basins in South America. It contains a sediment record that is at least 200 m long that may extend more than 250,000 years. Lake Junin is exceptional in the length of record that it contains, but also in the climate signals that it records. Considerable prior research has documented that Lake Junin records the waxing and waning of nearby alpine glaciers and changes in regional water balance through the isotope geochemistry of calcium carbonate deposited on the lake bottom at a rate of approximately 0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr. This research will develop these and other proxy climate records for the full length of recovered core; the records generated will comprise one of the longest continuous records of climate and environmental change from the inner tropics. <br/> The Lake Junin Drilling Project has several broader impacts. These include the joint renovation of an abandoned lodge for future shared use as the first shoreline outpost for officials of the Junin National Reserve, as a visitor center, and as a lake access point for ecotourism. Capacity building activities in the Junin Project include collaboration with Peruvian universities, training of geoscientists, as well as Peruvian and American student training. A specific team will be responsible for the organization of lectures at villages in the region to inform citizens about the significance of the drilling, and will work closely with the national park service to instruct the rangers on how to use the science to promote conservation efforts around the lake. During the drilling, a team will facilitate interactions with local and international media. The team expect to involve U.S. and Peruvian students in all aspects of Junin drilling, and much of the paleoecological research related to the Junin cores will be conducted by graduate students. Training opportunities during the drilling phase of operations are also planned for geoscientists from Peruvian universities. Numerous U.S. undergraduate and graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow will be involved in all phases of the proposed research. The material collected during this project will set the stage for significant future research. LacCore, the National Lacustrine Core Facility at the University of Minnesota, will facilitate this by overseeing the long-term storage, curation, and access to data and samples obtained in this project.<br/><br/>Technical Explanation<br/> Lake Junin, located at 4000 m asl in the inner-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, is a prime target for drilling because it contains a thick (>200 m) sediment package deposited at a high rate (0.2 to 1.0 mm/yr). Abundant research conducted on and around Lake Junin provides a compelling rationale for deep drilling. Moraine mapping coupled with cosmogenic radionuclide dating indicate that paleoglaciers reached the lake edge, but have not overridden the lake in as much as one million years. Lake Junin is one of the few lakes in the tropical Andes that predates the maximum extent of glaciation and is in a geomorphic position to record the waxing and waning of glaciers in nearby cordillera. Sediment coring of Lake Junin began in the 1970s; two cores spanning the past 50,000 years reveal that sedimentation has alternated between clastic sediments deposited during peak glacial periods and authigenic calcite (marl) precipitated from the water column during interglacial times. The lake also contains ideal sediments for multiproxy analysis that can be reliably dated using both the radiocarbon and U/Th methods. The oxygen isotopic composition of marl and ostracod carapaces demonstrate that authigenic calcite in Lake Junin primarily records the isotopic composition of precipitation and secondarily the degree of evaporative enrichment of lake water. Lake Junin contains a continuous record of tropical hydroclimate over interglacial and interstadial intervals for much of the past several hundred thousand years that is both comparable to, and an extension of stable isotope records from regional ice cores and speleothems. New organic geochemical proxies compliment the marl isotope record and offer the potential for a truly continuous isotope paleoclimate record through glacial and interglacial intervals alike. Lake Junin is ideally situated, both from logistical and scientific standpoints, to provide continuous high-resolution, independently-dated, long-term records of glaciation, and the variability of phenomena such as ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Because of the strong, demonstrated U/Th dating potential of Junin marl, we will be able to address critical issues regarding the synchrony of climate change in the tropics with that in high latitude regions of both hemispheres, the rate and timing of ecosystem response to climatic perturbations, and the dynamics of the geomagnetic field from a tropical perspective. Lake Junin is a scientifically mature site that will yield critical scientific insights that only drilling coupled with analysis can unlock.<br/>The primary objective of the proposed research is to develop the first continuous, high-resolution, absolute-dated late Quaternary record of climate change, water balance (P/E), glaciation, vegetation, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the tropical Andes. The well-dated Junin record will allow the team to develop proxy records spanning >200,000yr, which will document the timing of wet/dry cycles, glacial advances/retreats, and the impacts of climatic phenomena such as the changing strength and variability of ENSO, the South America Summer Monsoon, and shifts in the location and range of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. In addition, this study will provide an opportunity to date (via U-Th) the >40ka sections of both the Titicaca and Sabana de Bogota records through correlation of pollen, stable isotope, and paleomagnetic time series. This study will also enable important insights into the response of tropical vegetation to climate change in the upper Amazon Basin, and will provide a rare southern equatorial perspective on the evolution of Earth?s geomagnetic field.","hot_pink"

The first is to make the Yanomamo demographic and genealogical data base available to researchers via the Internet for use by interested social scientists who wish to test a wide variety of theories revolving around kinship, demographic processes, and marriage. The second goal is to test a variety of human evolutionary theories that address how variation in marriage form, marriage duration, and kin support affects the wellbeing and marital and social success of children. As a natural fertility population with little outside contact and with all known marital forms the Yanomamo are uniquely suited to shed light on the nature of human marriage and families. Just as importantly, the Yanomamï¿½ data base is the largest ever amassed for any tribal population. It was collected over a 35 year period through 25 field trips by Napoleon Chagnon from 1964-1999. Currently, this largely prospective data base has genealogical and demographic information on approximately 4,159 (2,107 living and 2,052 deceased) individuals and the project will permit the addition of another 2,500 Yanomamo who have yet to be entered, error checked, and integrated into the current data base. Its resultant size will allow comprehensive statistical analysis not possible with smaller data bases collected by anthropologists. The data will be archived for downloading in a variety of standard formats for statistical analysis. In addition, the project will create a freely available but more user friendly version of KINDEMCOM, a unique PC comparative statistical program designed for sophisticated genealogical analysis of the data. Once the data base is complete and publically goes on-line through IPSCR at the University of Michigan the project leaders and other interested social scientists will be able to investigate the genealogical and demographic dimensions of cultural and biological success.","maroon"

The LF will facilitate utilization of genomic, genetic and phenotypic information across a wide range of legume species that will allow researchers and breeders to take full advantage of the data that are currently available at the GDPs. The project will provide research training opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds at different educational levels. In the context of outreach, the project will pro-actively engage the community of legume data providers through presentations and workshops at national and international meetings as well as through a central web portal that will provide information describing project goals, methods of implementation and progress reports to the community. <br/><br/>The pace of data collection across crop and model plants has increased dramatically. Most crop species have both a data management problem and great opportunities to access genetic ""big data"". The objectives of this project are to develop a federation model for legume databases, to facilitate data exchange across a wide range of legume species to enable cross-species translational genomics, and to adapt an existing set of open-source tools for biological information management that will provide a framework for project-oriented data management enabling both long-term integration and widespread use. The specific goals are to: <br/><br/>1). Adopt and port the data currently managed in each of the custom frameworks into a set of well-integrated, open source model organism database tools;<br/>2). Define data formats, metadata standards, data exchange and Web service protocols to facilitate communications between species-centric databases at various levels; <br/>3). Utilize orthology, synteny, and mappings of other significant features to integrate genetic, genomic, and phenotypic data across legume species, to enable identification of common molecular bases for important traits and enable traversal across database projects;<br/>4). Improve the capacity of organism database projects to collect and manage complex phenotype data using ontologies, controlled vocabularies and well-defined protocols and schemas; and, <br/>5). Facilitate productive data exchange by implementing a common, open, virtualized Data Repository for data exchange across sites and for stable, long-term archiving of data sets, standardized metadata, and robust methods for archiving, searching, and accessing data sets from federated GDPs.<br/><br/>It is anticipated that the LF will provide a model for a well-accepted open-source technology stack that can be adopted by other research communities that have limited resources or technical expertise. All data will be freely available to the general public through the project web site and through the associated GDPs that include but are not limited to MedicagoGenome (http://medicagogenome.org), SoyBase (http://soybase.org), PeanutBase (http://peanutbase.org), and the Legume Information System (http://legumeinfo.org).","teal"

The past few decades have witnessed steady growth in studies of state-formation, particularly research on the state's increasing influence on the lives of ordinary people. This research, and much of sociology in general, has tended to neglect questions of language, in spite of language's foundational role in social life. This project addresses this gap in the literature by asking: What strategies does the state employ to accumulate symbolic power in the realm of language? This project will answer this question by focusing on the case of the Chinese transition from Classical to Modern Chinese, which occurred between the 1910s and 1930s. Previously, Classical Chinese had, much like Latin in Europe, functioned as a supranational language of scholarship and government. Nationalist movements in the latter half of the 19th century spurred the rise of national vernaculars in Korea, Japan, Vietnam, as well as in China. This project's closer examination of the Chinese case will clarify the social theory of language by looking at a state that in three decades accomplished what took place in Europe over several centuries.<br/><br/>To answer the question about how states shape language practices, this dissertation will examine Chinese government archival material located in the United States, Taiwan, and mainland China. The state-formation literature has largely been grounded in Western European cases, in which language change took place over centuries, and tends to treat non-European or postcolonial cases separately, as instances of state-led development or modernization. On the other hand, historical scholarship on China tends to look at changes in language practices as the result of various intellectual ""movements,"" which places intellectuals in an ambivalent relationship with the state. Relying on archival documents, including bureaucratic memoranda, statutes, regulations, meeting minutes, as well as official and personal correspondence, this project seeks to clarify the relationship between language-reforming intellectuals and the state, and thus clarify the state's role in influencing language practices. In so doing, this project will contribute to contemporary debates on the social implications of government policies on language and education, particularly social stratification stemming from unequal access to cultural capital.","crimson"

While the measures of ground motion intensity would have indicated moderate structural damage, instead ten reinforced concrete buildings collapsed and hundreds more have been reported to have severe damage as a consequence of the earthquake. This damage was surprising because Taiwan has made considerable investments into earthquake research, regulations, enforcement, and strengthening. To understand this discrepancy in reinforced concrete building performance, this Grant for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) will fund a team of researchers from the United States to travel to Taiwan to work with Taiwanese researchers to gather detailed building response data, including the observed damage and properties of building structures in quantifiable terms. Both damaged and undamaged buildings will be surveyed to produce a comprehensive data set that can be used to test hypotheses on causes of damage. The data set will be used to: (1) understand causes of building collapse, (2) identify building properties that increase probability of structural damage, (3) identify vulnerable structures in seismic areas, in particular older structures built prior to modern seismic design codes, and (4) study the relationship of the site response and building damage. Because Taiwan has adopted seismic design methodologies similar to those in the United States, this data set also will help improve understanding of the seismic vulnerability of reinforced concrete buildings in the United States. <br/><br/>The U.S. team will work with researchers from Taiwan's National Center for Research in Earthquake Engineering and National Cheng Kung University to gather data from 100 to 150 buildings affected by this earthquake. For each surveyed building, collected information will include: structural damage, geotechnical damage, structural configuration, key dimensions, building drawings, year of building code used for design, material properties, and for selected buildings, high-resolution image sequences to produce digital damage maps that can be used to quantify damage and performance in clear terms. Breaking with common practice, the team will survey both damaged and undamaged buildings, as well as retrofitted buildings. The project will produce a comprehensive data set, including information on ground motion (Taiwan has one of the densest networks of accelerometers in the world), geotechnical information, structural information, and observed performance. The data set will enable detailed engineering studies of specific buildings and sites. In total, the data set will form a ""testbed"" to: (1) evaluate state-of-the-art methodologies used to evaluate building vulnerability, including vulnerability to collapse, (2) develop new damage indicators for rapid screening of the built infrastructure, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of retrofit strategies. The data set will be archived in the data repository on the DesignSafe-CI.org web site for broad use by researchers, educators, and the practicing engineering community in the United States, Taiwan, and other countries.

Dryad is distinguished by the close association of data deposition with the process and business of scholarly publishing, and by using article publication as a model for how researchers can benefit from data sharing infrastructure. In a short time, dozens of journals have adopted Dryad as a mechanism for data archiving, and the repository is now at a point of transition to a sustainable organization that has the capacity to make thousands of new datasets each year openly available for reuse in perpetuity. Technical and organizational innovations supported by this award will enhance the Dryad's scalability and sustainability. The technical goals include: automation of metadata curation and preservation tasks; developing more efficient and scalable processes to integrate the manuscript submission processes of journals with the data submission process of Dryad; enhancing the features and usability of the deposition interface; and improving the machine and human interfaces for filtering, searching and accessing repository contents. Dryad?s business model will be refined through evaluation of the costs and benefits of data archiving and data reuse to stakeholders, and continued evaluation of Dryad's role with respect to the many emergent technologies in the world of publishing and data repositories. Dryad's sustainability will be addressed by implementing a nonprofit governance and revenue model that has been developed over the past three years by diverse stakeholders in the research, publishing, library and funder communities. <br/><br/>The Broader Impacts of Dryad stem from its potential to transform the way research data are communicated and preserved. The credibility and effectiveness of the research enterprise is due in large part to the social contract behind scholarly publishing. Researchers are incentivized to disclose their work to their peers in return for professional credit. In so doing, they also expose their findings to be confirmed or refuted, and enable other researchers to build upon their results. Dryad seeks to extend this social contract to research data by providing a model for how a disciplinary repository can incentivize researchers to disclose the data that is of the greatest value for scientific reuse, that associated with publications, and realize the manifold benefits of free access to scientific data in perpetuity. This award will provide resources for Dryad to to reach out to the next generation of researchers through educational initiatives and partnerships with the broader community. As new journal and funder mandates raise demand and expectations for data management, preservation, and dissemination services, Dryad - as a stable, community-governed organization - aims to be in a position to provide the necessary infrastructure, as well as provide a focused forum for participating journals, societies and publishers to take coordinated, and well-informed, steps toward improved policy and practice.<br/><br/><br/>_____________________________________________________________________________","puce"

This collaborative interdisciplinary research project aims to consolidate, into a single user-friendly database, information about volcanic products detected in Antarctica. By consolidating information about volcanic sources, and physical and geochemical characteristics of volcanic products, this systematic data collection approach will improve the ability of researchers to identify volcanic ash, or tephra, from specific volcanic eruptions that may be spread over large areas in a geologically instantaneous amount of time. Development of this database will assist in the identification and cross-correlation of time intervals in various paleoclimate archives that contain volcanic layers from often unknown sources. The AntT project relies on a cyberinfrastructure framework developed in house through NSF funded CDI-Type I: CiiWork for data assimilation, interpretation and open distribution model. In addition to collection and integration of existing information about volcanic products, this project will focus on filling the information gaps about unique physico-chemical characteristics of very fine (<3 micrometer) volcanic particles (cryptotephra) that are present in Antarctic ice cores. This component of research will involve improving analytical methodology for detecting cryptotephra layers in ice, and will train a new generation of scientists to apply an array of modern state?of?the-art instrumentation available to the project team. <br/><br/>The recognized importance of tephra in establishing a chronological framework for volcanic and sedimentary successions has already resulted in the development of robust regional tephrochronological frameworks (e.g. Europe, Kamchatka, New Zealand, Western North America). The AntT project will provide this framework for Antarctic tephrochronology, as needed for precise correlation records between Antarctic ice cores (e.g. WAIS Divide, RICE, ITASE) and global paleoclimate archives. The results of AntT will be of particular significance to climatologists, paleoclimatologists, atmospheric chemists, geochemists, climate modelers, solar-terrestrial physicists, environmental statisticians, and policy makers for designing solutions to mitigate or cope with likely future impacts of climate change events on modern society.","plum"

The project places alternate framings of pesticides - as indispensable to agricultural production or as unacceptable environmental pollutants - within the context of the racial legacy of plantation agriculture. By centering race as a factor agricultural and environmental politics, this project seeks to advance understanding of the relationship between rural inequality and environmental change. It asks how the racial politics of the plantation impacted early development of pesticides as an agricultural technology; how historic tensions between agricultural productivity and racial equity contributed to current structures of agro-environmental regulation; and how different narratives of agricultural change connected to race relations inform contemporary debates over the use and regulation of pesticides. Placing the dual objectives of racial equity and agricultural productivity at the center of inquiry, the project provides a policy-relevant analysis of the obstacles to and opportunities for greater environmental and social sustainability through agricultural practices. Oral histories produced through this study will be archived, and made publically available, in order to expand public knowledge and inform future research. The findings of the study will be shared widely through both scholarly articles and publications for broader audiences in order to deepen understanding of the relationship between environmental justice and contemporary agricultural production.<br/><br/>The study is positioned at the intersection of scholarship on political ecology, environmental justice, and agrarian studies. Through a case study in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta, one of the world's most pesticide-intensive regions during the mid-20th century and a highly productive agricultural region in the present day, the research will ask how the politics of pesticide usage in agricultural production and environmental regulation reproduce, or challenge, the historical racial politics of the plantation. In order to provide a textured history of the role of pesticides in the production of racially unequal spaces, the project draws upon oral history methodologies and archival research. Through semi-structured interviews and participant observation, the study also examines how this history informs contemporary uses and understandings of pesticides in the present day. By connecting historical inquiry with contemporary research, this project will enrich understandings of the historical determinants of contemporary agro-environmental practices, while centering race as a key factor in environmental change.","maroon"

DGR is a world-class repository for frozen biological materials representing >200,000 organisms that are digitized and fully searchable on-line. Over 84% are associated with traditional voucher specimens. Dating back to 1979, DGR is the largest wild mammal collection worldwide, and among the top 10 largest bird tissue collections. The facility also houses substantial fish, amphibian and reptile tissues including critical samples from endangered species and threatened ecosystems. DGR is worldwide in scope with excellent representation from North America, Asia, Africa, and throughout Latin America. These specimens provide critical resources for studies of specialized and interdisciplinary studies. Annually > 50 loans of approximately 2000 specimens generate >80 peer-reviewed publications. DGR has held a leadership role in developing connections between the museum community and the molecular genomic efforts. This upgrade to DGR provides a platform to further those efforts, and also leverages the heavy involvement of DGR with municipal, state, and federal agencies, especially in the fields of natural resource management and public and wildlife health. Planned outreach utilizes existing programs at the museum to educate the public, including young students, on the role of collections in the practice of science that benefits society.<br/><br/>This project will create a state-of-the-art facility by replacing the existing electrical (-80C) freezer system with 3 large liquid nitrogen freezers and a nitrogen generator that will significantly increase sample quality by providing much lower archival temperatures (-190C) and much longer protection should there be a catastrophic interruption of power or other emergency. In addition this upgrade will reduce electrical consumption substantially (>60% reduction). All samples to be moved will receive unique barcodes to enable the transfer of associated specimen data into a digital object tracking system and to informatics applications. The associated database, Arctos, has direct links to GenBank (and soon IsoBank) that immediately tie the specimen and associated museum data (spatial, temporal, morphological) to other Big Data on the web. This connection places the museum specimen as the primary nexus that connects not only the publications derived from specimen-based research, but also the increasingly vast amounts of new molecular data derived from each specimen.","puce"

Isolation from one another slows progress, creating expensive redundant effort around the globe. Open exchange of findings is a cornerstone of the scientific community, and for the individual scientist, in linguistics and beyond, participation in that exchange grows more important, but also more challenging, as cutting-edge research becomes both more interdisciplinary, and more international, than at any time in history. The number and diversity of workshops and conferences that active researchers feel a responsibility to participate in is exploding around the world. This is by and large positive, of course, but it also places an increasingly unsustainable burden on many scientists that by all rights should be included in these critical conversations. International travel, rewarding as it may be, is also time-consuming and expensive. For those with disabilities, it may be prohibitively difficult. For scholars from institutions with fewer resources, or from less wealthy parts of the world, finances may derail otherwise sound travel plans. Other commitments, such as those to family, or local academic and administrative responsibilities, further compete for the time necessary to attend meetings. Visa restrictions add to this expense and effort, and sheer geographic remoteness is often sufficient to convince would-be conference attendees to stay home instead. In some cases, technology already exists to allow participants to bridge the travel issue and participate remotely in scientific gatherings. At least in linguistics, however, these technologies, owing in large part to their expense and unfamiliarity, tend to be deployed, if at all, in a limited fashion, around the margins of most meetings. Remote participants therefore miss out on most of the key scientific discussion taking place at these meetings. <br/><br/>This proposal presents a plan to pilot, at the upcoming Speech Prosody 2016 conference at Boston University, a suite of solutions that will enable members of the scientific community to participate in conference activities as fully from remote locations as from the host location itself. Data will be collected concerning the usability and attractiveness of each technology, and will be used to devise a future budget model whereby such remote participation strategies can one day become self-funding. Specifically, this project will implement remote participation solutions for the following scenarios: 1) discussion and Q&A during oral sessions; 2) remote presentation of posters; 3) active attendance and interaction during poster sessions, and 4) ""passive"" attendance at oral and poster sessions, both in real time, and after the fact via digital archives of the proceedings. Solutions include streaming video, stationary iPads at posters, and mobile telepresence robots. A dynamic post-conference proceedings package featuring video archiving and asynchronous discussion forums will promote sustained interaction after the conference. Ultimately, this works aims to move not just linguistics, but other fields as well, toward a standard of remote participation that can become the norm at meetings, workshops, and conferences around the world.","maroon"

Understanding evolution is essential for figuring out solutions to modern problems such as antibiotic resistance, a major problem in medicine, and for understanding how life on our planet became so diverse and how it will change next. Animal weapons including such intriguing structures as horns on bighorn sheep, antlers on deer, and tusks on elephants, have fascinated people for centuries. The earliest-known human paintings show wild animals fighting with weapons. In spite of the interest these structures have attracted, understanding of weapon diversity is in its infancy. This project will increase understanding of why even closely-related species can have profoundly different weapons. Simultaneously, it will provide important insights into why other shapes and forms in nature can be so variable. Data and specimens collected as part of this project will be stored in scientific archives and museums, where they will be shared freely with other researchers for use in future projects. This project will also contribute directly to the science education of more than two hundred college students. These students will learn how to do science and to recognize that science is a process, not just a collection of facts. The researchers will also interact and share their results with the general public through blogs, presentations, and student-made videos about experiences doing science.<br/><br/>The diverse traits resulting from sexual selection offer outstanding opportunities for understanding the evolutionary interactions between behavior and morphology. It is now well established that mate choice and male-male competition can select for differences in the sizes of ornaments and weapons. However the evolution of the shape of these traits is more puzzling. Why has such shape diversity evolved? In the case of animal weapons, habitat-driven changes in male-male competitive behavior are hypothesized to be a central factor. However, explicit tests of this hypothesis are virtually nonexistent. This project will examine the roles of fighting behavior, ecology, and function in the evolution of weapon shape, capitalizing on the extreme weapon shape diversity and myriad of fighting styles in leaf-footed bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae) to address the long-standing puzzle of weapon shape diversity. Methods include experimental selection analyses, finite element analysis, phylogenetics, and ancestral state reconstructions. The successful completion of this project will offer an unprecedented analysis of the evolutionary interplay between behavior and morphology, using the medium of weaponry. Data and specimens will be stored and shared with other scientists through international archives, including NCBI, DRYAD, and the Florida Museum of Natural History. Over 200 undergraduates will contribute to the completion of this project through Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CURE), and curricular materials developed for this purpose will be shared with other educators through workshops and publications. Training in the integration of research and education will also be provided to a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. Substantial outreach will be accomplished through the production of short videos by students, blogs, research spotlights, social media, and public presentations.","teal"

The need to understand circumpolar health, meaning how the Arctic environment impacted human bodies and minds, came about as Cold War tensions rose in the United States, which resulted in Alaska taking on a new strategic importance. From its inception, circumpolar health was entangled in the processes of American colonialism in Alaska and was instrumental in generating sustained scientific interest in Alaska Native peoples. It also became a site from which Alaska Native peoples made claims for autonomy, articulated their health demands, and critiqued the policies of the American state. The researcher will share the results of this study at academic conferences and in peer-reviewed historical journals. The project will culminate in the publication of a book with an academic press. Any oral histories produced over the course of this research are to be donated to an appropriate library collection and thereby contribute to the broader aim of increasing the representation of Native Alaskan voices in the Alaskan archival record.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This project will explain the construction of circumpolar health through three key periods, during the early Cold War, the 1960s and 1970s when the U.S. government began to rapidly expand Alaska's public health infrastructure, and in the 1980s when Alaskan circumpolar health movement became institutionalized locally through academic institutions and scientific organizations. At each stage, the researcher will consider how the imperatives of Cold War politics, the aims of biomedicine, and the priorities of Alaska Native peoples interacted to shape the development of circumpolar health. The study builds upon work in the history of Cold War science that have shown how science and technology became tools for militarizing and industrializing Arctic regions during the Cold War. It adopts an innovative approach. By contrast with existing histories, it focuses on Native Alaskans' agency as Cold War historical actors and traces their role in altering the power dynamics of circumpolar health research over time. It situates Alaska as a site where Cold War biomedical knowledge was actually produced, beginning as knowledge made about the Arctic, and transitioning to knowledge made in the Arctic. The project will also reflect on the ways that historical antecedents have shaped the ethics and practice of contemporary Arctic biomedical research.","crimson"

The project asks how seed banking practices in a post-colonial era differ from movement of botanical specimens during earlier eras of science and governance. It will study the changes in laboratory and visualization techniques, through ten months of archival and ethnographic fieldwork in England and the United States. It will use theories from the fields of STS, environmental humanities, and visual culture, to contribute new concepts concerning agricultural innovation, food security, biodiversity preservation, and to challenge the frontiers on basic genetic science. The results of this research will be published in scholarly articles in peer-reviewed journals, and as part of a book project with an academic press; in addition, they will be disseminated to specific target communities via workshops and seminars. The results of this study will also be used to develop undergraduate curriculum that will bridge gaps between the humanities, the social sciences, and the biological sciences. In addition, new primary material such as the high resolution scans of plant patent drawings will be made available to scholars and the public via the web. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The primary site of this project is Kew Garden's Millennium Seed Bank, the largest repository of cryogenically preserved plant genetics resources in the world. This project will bring to light how seed science is made at seed banks with the aim of adding value to the process and showing how it can be done better. It will do so by giving acute attention to the Seed Bank's relationship to the historical movement of plant bodies, debates around biodiversity, intellectual property, and agricultural applications. It will also examine various types of collaboration across many scales of activity, among different professions, disciplines, and scientific specialties that make seeds such widely shared objects of knowledge capable of transcending boundaries of major departments of formal scientific inquiry. The results of this project will contribute pertinent insights for important policy decisions about the fates of biodiversity, food security, and agribusiness, which all depend on the science of seeds. They will also serve in addressing pivotal questions being posed by scholars of agricultural and plant history, twentieth century US agricultural policy, intellectual property of biological materials, advocacy over rights to seeds, and visual culture.","crimson"

A wide range of methods are used in the biological sciences to produce many different kinds of data, which may require the application of different types of identifiers to make connections between physical samples, digital data, analysis, and publications. This project will develop and evaluate proof-of-concept and prototype services with particular focus on DNA/RNA sequence data.

Thousands flooded state capitols in protest; legislators fled to neighboring states to delay votes, and an unsuccessful and highly controversial gubernatorial recall election was waged. This study provides a comparative and historical lens to understand these events and provides new insights into social movements and labor unions in particular. The research examines legislative campaigns over labor rights in Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin as they were waged both in the late 1950s, at the peak of union strength, and in the early 2010s when unions were far weaker. By analyzing policy continuity and change across these states and over time, the study design allows for the detection of enduring features of labor relations, including areas where unions have long struggled, as well as how broad social processes like globalization and deindustrialization, which have developed in the interim, shape struggles over labor rights. Study findings will contribute to a better understanding of American labor relations and will provide new insights on the sources of influence among business interests and other advocacy organizations in civil society. <br/><br/>This comparative historical study examines legislative campaigns over Right-to-Work laws and public sector collective bargaining rights in Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin as they were waged both in the late 1950s, during the heyday of the so-called capital-labor accord, and in the early 2010s when unions were far weaker. This study seeks to understand patterns of continuity and policy change, both across the three states and over time, how labor unions and their shifting field of opponents forged coalitions, built support for policy proposals, and influenced legislation, and how these strategies have changed over time. The study is unique by providing a comparative historical lens to understand the recent and high profile struggles over labor rights in the American Midwest. It provides new insight on the 1950s as a critical decade for union development and contributes to social movement theory by analyzing the processes and outcomes of activist mobilization by not just unions, but corporations and business federations as well. The project incorporates archival data from unions, business organizations and elected officials involved in the campaigns across the two periods and in-depth interviews with a range of participants in the 2010s.

It does so by documenting and analyzing public (the United States government - specifically the United Stated Department of Agriculture, USDA) and private (the International Harvester Corporation, IHC), agricultural extension efforts that targeted the American South as a site of underdevelopment in the first decades of the 20th century. Scholars have traced the roots of the concept of 'development' within the European context to the advent of modern liberalism and the age of empires in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but few have brought the insights of postcolonial theory to an understanding of American forms of development. As a result, the understanding of the historical and geographical contexts that gave rise to US forms of development is partial and limited. The specific goals of this research project are: 1) to query the history and nature of development practices through the case of agricultural extension services; 2) to question how and why the South became a space of difference; and 3) to understand the ways in which experts, expert knowledge, and public policies, were shaped and in turn helped shape the social construction (class, race, and gender) of the US South in the first decades of the 20th century, and by so doing, to contribute to an understanding of the fluidity and complexity of bio-political efforts to develop the world in the post-World War II period. Using a case-study approach, and through archival and document analysis, the investigator will analyze IHC's and the USDA's agricultural extension practices and encounters in three states (Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas) in the first three decades of the 20th century (1900-1929). The research will be accomplished primarily through the analysis of the content, language, and image style of archival material (accounts of agricultural extension agents, photographs of extension activities, contemporary documents produced by IHC and USDA, particularly their educational pamphlets, regional and thematic maps, letters between agents and government and corporate officials, contemporary newspaper accounts) held at ten different institutions throughout the United States. The research will provide an in-depth and contextually-rich exemplar of the ways in which the language, practices, and ideas that underpin contemporary US development policies were formulated and took shape in the early 20th century in the American South. Ultimately, this project will contribute to a more complete understanding of the making of American development practices, an understanding that is crucial for any critical examination of its contemporary non-military interventions throughout the world.<br/><br/>By involving students from underrepresented groups this research project will enhance the goal of diversifying geographical education and research, and will broaden the scholarly infrastructure for research by forming educational partnerships with four historically-Black institutions of higher education. This research will be disseminated widely through teaching activities, publications, conference presentations, and lectures at universities in Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Since the research findings have the potential to speak to contemporary policy debates in terms of agricultural extension services and agricultural development, the findings will also be disseminated through discussions and presentations at appropriate local, regional and national agricultural policy forums.","maroon"

The goal of first language acquisition research is to determine how children acquire their native language given the linguistic input to which they are exposed. Research has shown that children do not just imitate word-for-word their input; instead, they produce forms not found in their parents' speech, such as ""He eat-ed it"" or ""I'm hang onto-ing it."" Moreover, the linguistic input to which children are exposed is quite complex, as utterances do not always match their underlying representation. For example, in sentences like ""Do you want to go?"" speakers variably omit the first two words, producing: ""You wanna go?"", ""wanna go?"", depending on social context. This project examines the impact of this latter sort of variable input on the acquisition of language in children. <br/><br/>The empirical domain of this project is the acquisition of properties related to--what has traditionally been called--the Null Subject Parameter in two varieties of Spanish: Dominican Spanish (DS) and Chilean Spanish (ChS). While ChS shows properties of a null subject language, DS displays a number of syntactic properties that are infrequent in other non-Caribbean varieties of Spanish, including variable usage of overt expletive subjects, higher use of overt pronominal subjects in contexts of topic continuity, and variable usage of subject-verb (non)inversion in interrogatives. By comparing acquisition patterns in children exposed to two varieties of the same language, we can compare acquisition of specific grammatical structures in the context of two input types (e.g. consistent input v. variable input) while holding other properties of the language constant. <br/><br/>This project will collect 120 hours of naturalistic speech between DS caregivers and their children while they play and read together and 40 hours of Dominican adult-to-adult speech. Audio-recordings and transcriptions will be archived on the CHILDES database (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) for use by future researchers and will provide much needed data on language development in children acquiring non-mainstream dialects of Spanish, which is important in the context of standardized testing, early education, and clinical intervention in the case of speech disorders. This project will also provide international research experience to both graduate and undergraduate students, who will collect data in the Dominican Republic.","maroon"

Human success as a social species is built around this mutual benefit, but we know little about its evolution and maintenance. Cooperative groups risk being vulnerable to cheating, if a group member takes advantage of the effort of others to secure a disproportionate amount of resources. In groups of relatives, these effects can be offset by kinship. However, the costs and benefits of cooperation among non-relatives are more difficult to assess and explain. The California harvester ant provides a rare opportunity to examine the costs and benefits of cooperation among non-relatives. In this species, some queens practice primary polygyny, in which unrelated queens cooperatively build a new nest and rear offspring together, forming what is essentially a multi-family colony. The proposed work will investigate what ecological conditions favor the evolution of cooperation in this species, and how these cooperative societies deal with the possibility of cheating by some group members. The proposed research will be combined with undergraduate training, in which students participate in field and laboratory research. This builds on a record of mentoring excellence by the principal investigator and graduate student. The researchers will also work in conjunction with the local parks department to provide educational materials highlighting this unusual ant population. This research is fundamental to our understanding of social evolution, and may provide insight into the issues of cooperation and conflict in human societies.<br/><br/>Prior work has shown that colonies in the polygynous population have lower reproductive output than those in a nearby population without polygyny. This suggests polygyny may be a functional response to local environmental constraints. Polygynous colonies also face issues of cheating, if reproduction is non-equitably distributed among queens. Interpretation of these findings is limited, because the polygynous and single-queen populations investigated so far are in different environments. The researchers will quantify the reproductive output of single- versus multi-queen colonies within a single population, to determine whether variation in reproduction is environmentally driven, or an intrinsic colony attribute. This analysis will be combined with a food supplement experiment, to determine whether reproduction in polygynous colonies is resource limited. Finally, relative queen contributions to reproduction versus worker production within polygynous colonies will be analyzed via microsatellites, to determine whether queens share in reproduction equitably. If not, this suggests that subtle cheating may be taking place within these cooperative associations. Data will be stored locally and on ASU server space for a minimum of 5 years, with the expectation of permanently archiving them. Data will be indexed and made available to an open source data depository after publication.","teal"

Interoperability between such representations and systems emerged as a central challenge in the design of manufacturing information systems that is costing the US industry and economy billions while impeding major technological trends. This research project aims to make broad advances in theory and practice of geometric interoperability.

If the mechanisms can be better understood, then the uncertainties associated with making climate predictions on these timescales can be assessed more accurately. Decadal variability over the Pacific is of particular interest in the United States due to its downstream influence over the western United States and its direct influence on climate in Alaska. This project addresses the fundamental question of what are the predictability limits, mechanisms, and regional impacts for decadal modes of the Pacific climate system using a hierarchy of climate models and modern statistical tools. The results of this project will be important in assessing how long-term changes in the environment drive changes in economically important variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, snowfall, temperatures, as well as oceanic temperatures, currents and sea levels, which impacts fisheries, agriculture, and coastal infrastructure along the U.S. West Coast and Asian Marginal Seas. The tools developed in this project should be transferable to other global sectors that also exhibit decadal variability. The project team will mentor graduate students and post-docs, whose educational experiences will include cross-disciplinary exposure to ocean science, atmospheric science, and societal impacts that will be unique in this context. Community outreach will include lectures and educational presentations in public forums, mentoring K-12 students, educating grass-roots climate action organizations, informing the media, and posting research results on web pages.<br/><br/>There is clearly a large gap in our understanding of what controls Pacific decadal climate variability, what limits the predictability of the flows, and what practical skill might be useful in regional impacts on land and in the ocean. The project team proposes a coordinated research effort to better understand the basic physical dynamics of Pacific decadal variability and assess the skill of Pacific decadal predictability, along with its uncertainties and practical value. The research focuses on Community Earth System Model (CESM), with its vast repository of archived runs supplemented with targeted predictability experiments. The analysis focuses on using sophisticated statistical models (Linear Inverse Models) to identify statistical relations among variables, diagnose physical processes, and isolate potentially predictable components of the flows. It also involves using regional coupled atmosphere-ocean, along with uncoupled ocean and atmosphere models, to enhance the understanding of regional response and its potential for practical use in forecasting. The project brings together scientists skilled with developing decadal climate diagnostics, making both statistical and dynamical predictions, and executing regional coupled climate downscaling and regional high-resolution ocean modeling.","lavender"

Linguistics is a data-driven social science, in which inferences about human cognition and social structure are drawn from observations of linguistic practice. These observations, in the form of recordings and associated annotations, represent the primary data sets that underlie the field. This practice has its roots in philology, which relies on texts as a primary data source. However, three recent and inter-related factors make the data-oriented model of linguistics particularly relevant to the field at the current time. First, a major shift in technology has resulted in rapidly growing volumes of digital language data. Second, more than half of the world?s languages are critically endangered, so that in the not-so-distant future archival data will be the only source of information on those languages. Third, the emergence of Documentary Linguistics as a recognized sub-field has led to an increased focus on data curation and management. While linguists have always relied on language data, they have not always facilitated access to those data. Linguistic publications typically include short excerpts from data sets, ordinarily consisting of fewer than five words, and often without citation. Where citations are provided, the connection to the data set is usually only vaguely identified. An excerpt might be given a citation which refers to the name of the text from which it was extracted, but in practice the reader has no way to access that text. That is, in spite of the potential generated by recent shifts in the field, a great deal of linguistic research created today is not reproducible, either in principle or in practice. The workshops and panel presentation will facilitate development of standards for the curation and citation of linguistics data that are responsive to these changeing conditions and shift the field of linguistics toward a more scientific, data-driven model which results in reproducible research. <br/><br/>A primary factor hindering the development of reproducible research in linguistics is the lack of standards for data citation and attribution. Although language data are increasingly recognized as important, there are no widely established guidelines for the citation of these data. Equally important, there are no standards for attribution. Lacking such standards, journals, academic tenure and promotion committees, and peer review processes continue to emphasize linguistic analyses over linguistic data, and as a result linguists have little incentive to make data accessible. A data-driven linguistic science has the potential to provide substantiation of scientific claims by promoting attention to the care and structuring of language data. By the end of the project, the researchers will have held three workshops to research and develop a model for data citation and attribution in linguistics; facilitated discipline-wide discussion on these topics at the 2017 annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America; written a position paper on standards for citation and attribution in linguistics; and submitted a proposal for a Resolution on citation and attribution to the LSA.","aquamarine"

Very often fine scale physics is also nonlocal and therefore these problems pose a great challenge to the current computational techniques. Nonlocality of fine-scales and advecting sharp gradients are two key ingredients in the modeling of several classes of fluid dynamics problems. This research effort focuses on the development of variationally based methods for problems with steep gradients and discontinuities in the underlying fields and wherein fine scales have a nonlocal feature. Of specific interest are propagating steep fronts for which interacting discontinuities challenge the stability of the numerical methods. Typical examples are chemically reacting fluids permeating through porous elastic solids where fast reaction rates produce steep concentration fronts. Such problems arise in (i) high temperature injection molding of fibrous composites in micro and nanomaterials engineering, and (ii) enhanced oil recovery and secondary shale gas recovery processes in petroleum engineering. Another class of problems from mathematical physics is advection dominated viscous flows leading to anisotropic turbulence. <br/><br/>The PI will develop a unique and novel, simultaneous top-down and bottom-up multiscale approach for consistent representation of both the hierarchy of scales as well as the structure of inter-scale coupling operators for complex fluid mechanics problems. It blends ideas from the Variational Multiscale (VMS) method that helps decompose the governing system of equations into coarse-scale and fine-scale sub-problems and then employs Weak Galerkin (WG) ideas at the fine-scale variational level to extract models for the finer physics. Weak continuity of functions that is facilitated by the Weak Galerkin method results in fine-scale models that are nonlocal. A further generalization of WG via Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) ideas provides a framework to develop methods for problems with sharp gradients on sound mathematical basis. This notion leads to variationally derived Discontinuity Capturing (DC) methods that are independent of the user-defined or user-designed parameters. Emphasis is placed throughout on variationally consistent interscale coupling with rigorous treatment of the continuity conditions that are critical for the mathematical and algorithmic stability. The resulting computational algorithms will be ideal for massively parallel computing on distributed systems where message passing traditionally has been a bottle neck. The variational structures underlying the new methods will increase local-solves that are cost effective because of local resident memory on the new generation of processors while substantially reducing global communication between processors, thereby leading to efficient and economic computations. The mathematical frameworks and computational algorithms emanating from this work will be broadly disseminated by publication in high-quality archival journals, and by presentations at high impact conferences.","silver"

Congestion costs the commercial trucking industry $9.2 billion annually, and incidents have been shown to increase the risk of secondary crashes by 2.8 percent with every minute of congestion. To address these economic and safety issues, traffic incident management (TIM) centers, typically operated by state departments of transportation (DOT), monitor roadways for traffic incidents, coordinate incident response, and provide traffic management and control to minimize the impacts of traffic incidents. This research will develop a new TIM system, called TIMELI (Traffic Incident Management Enabled by Large-data Innovations), that has greatly enhanced capabilities for incident risk assessment and response over current products. Software-based intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that are currently available are limited to very basic controls and do not provide comprehensive or dynamic decision support. These systems display streams of traffic data on a map and rely on technicians to input a control action. To address these limitations, this smart system aims to be a more effective data-driven TIM that provides user-centric information visualization and improved analytics and machine learning. Use of the system by state DOTs can reduce the duration and impacts of incidents and improve the safety of motorists, crash victims, and emergency responders. Use will also reduce the TIM technician fatigue and reduce their turnover rates. <br/><br/>The goal and outcome of TIMELI is to use emerging large-scale data analytics to reduce the number of road incidents through proactive traffic control and to minimize the impact of individual incidents that do occur through early detection, response, and traffic management and control. This will be achieved using end-to-end machine learning for situational awareness, the design and rapid solution of geo-temporally aware traffic models using partial differential equations, stochastic model predictive control, and user-centric advanced visualization techniques for decision assistance. Current technology gaps in data handling and archiving, analysis for decision support, and the design of output formats will be addressed using big data technologies. Multiple large data streams will be ingested and data analytics will be performed for quality assurance and anomaly detection. New algorithmic approaches, machine learning, and a stochastic framework will be used to detect anomalous outliers and implement context-sensitive traffic models. An advanced human machine interface will provide information visualization and decisions recommendations in an intuitive format to minimize any cognitive bottlenecks. The objectives are to develop TIMELI and to integrate it into an existing TIM system. These will be accomplished by the following methods: (1) defining TIM user requirements and identifying bottlenecks in technician tasks using human factors research; (2) developing a prototype that includes a big-data-enabled back-end solution, an analytics engine, and a front-end interface; and (3) conducting testing, evaluation, and integration within Iowa DOT's existing TIM environment. TIMELI's multiple innovations will transform current TIM systems by creating a smart and reliable decision assist system used to monitor traffic conditions in real time, proactively control risk using advisory control, quickly detect traffic incidents, identify the location and potential cause of these incidents, suggest traffic control alternatives, and minimize cognitive bottlenecks for TIM operators. The test bed will be the Center for Transportation Research and Education's fully functional traffic operations lab that is connected to the Iowa DOT's data streams.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to education by involving undergraduate and graduate researchers in Civil Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Human Factors Engineering, and will generate real-world data sets that will be used in developing educational material.<br/><br/>The partners in this project are Iowa State University (lead academic institutions), TransCore (a commercial provider of intelligent transportation systems, Des Moines, IA), and Iowa Department of Transportation-DOT (government agency, Ames, IA).","tan"

With National Science Foundation (NSF) support, the LTRR operates an analysis program for tree-ring samples collected by LTRR and other archaeologists from Alaska to Argentina and from the Pacific Ocean to the Mississippi River. NSF support allows the program to keep pace with the ever growing demand for archaeological tree-ring dating, and to maintain high production levels and short turnaround times. On average, more than 1,000 dates from 4,000+ archaeological tree-ring samples are produced annually. These data are integrated into relevant archaeological contexts to construct refined cultural sequences and examine important issues of past human behavior that cannot be addressed without accurate, high resolution temporal control. Among these topics are absolute site, locality, and regional chronologies, social organization structure, intergroup interaction, and cultural adaptation to physical and social environments. The program actively promotes the expansion of archaeological tree-ring dating into new regions such as the Southwestern deserts, Great Basin, Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, Alaska, Mexico, and South America.<br/><br/>The project has additional intellectual merits. Exact dating and chronology building are crucial to understanding human behavior, human-environment interactions, and processes of sociocultural stability, variation, change, and social evolution. Either directly or indirectly (through tree-ring dated ceramics), tree-ring dating underlies the chronology of Southwestern prehistory and many aspects of the documented history of the region. The project also generates dendroclimatic reconstructions that are combined with reconstructions produced by other paleoenvironmental disciplines such as geology, pollen analysis, volcanology, and trace element studies. In addition to illuminating past environmental processes, these integrated reconstructions provide a solid empirical foundation for examining the interrelationships between human behavior and environmental variability. Finally, the project's efforts to expand research into areas previously thought to be unsuitable for archaeological tree-ring provide absolutely dated ""hinge points"" for archaeological chronologies in the Sonoran Desert, the Great Basin, the western Great Plains, northern Mexico, and South America.<br/><br/>The project has a wide range of broader impacts. Its findings are almost immediately integrated into undergraduate and graduate classes in anthropology, geosciences, and other disciplines at the University of Arizona and other academic institutions. In addition, the project interacts with K-12 programs and provides public tours of the facility; it provides instruction for visiting scholars from around the world and facilitates field and laboratory training for non-profit, governmental, private sector, and Native American programs. Students accrue particular benefits from the reduced cost of analysis, thus allowing them to conduct extensive research at lower costs. The LTRR tree-ring sample collections and data archives are unparalleled, easily accessed resources for archaeological research, and an under-construction digital database will enhance the research value of these resources. Increased understanding of long-term human adaptation to cultural and environmental variability and enhanced knowledge of past environmental processes help develop and implement environmental and social policy. Project personnel have contributed directly to formulating policy for managing cultural and natural resources by federal, local, and tribal land management agencies.","maroon"

In particular, this project provides a foundation for biocultural diversity research at the local level, avoiding subjectively-defined ethnic and linguistic boundaries. By comparing current and traditional resource use, ecosystem services can be understood, helping to inform policy and management decisions.<br/><br/>The open and extensible platform developed by this project will provide a foundation for use by both researchers and community members.

Scientific research has explored the motivations for such speculative investments at the government level, but there has been significantly less focus on the process through which property is formalized in land registration and titling practices. This project, which trains a graduate in methods of rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, examines a context historically impacted by varied, and sometimes competing, land registration and titling practices. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, findings from this case study would be developed and shared with international scholars and organizations, thereby increasing international scientific cooperation. <br/><br/>Johns Hopkins University doctoral student Paul Kohlbry, with the direction of Dr. Deborah Poole, will undertake an ethnographic and historical study of land registration efforts in the West Bank. He will explore the ways in which Jordanian, Israeli and Palestinian Authority land registration projects have instituted private property and transformed political and economic life in rural areas. This research relies on data from the Jordanian archives, oral histories in Palestinian villages, interviews with bureaucrats, lawyers, businessmen and land registration personnel, and observation of an ongoing land registration project. His hypothesis is that Jordanian and Israeli land registration made private property central to nationalist political conflicts which revolved around the ownership of agricultural land. However, the long decline of agricultural production in Palestine over the past decades has lessened agriculture's economic and political significance. The research contributes to understanding how current land titling efforts by the Palestinian Authority unfold in the context with local and national conflicts around the sale of agricultural land and transform the relationship between the Palestinian government and its subjects and between Israelis and Palestinians. By giving careful attention to the various processes that constitute land registration, his research seeks to expand current social science literature on land privatization and agrarian change. This study also deepens our understanding of Palestine and the Middle East and adopts a methodology that focuses on economic, rather than cultural or religious factors. Finally, it sheds new light on the mundane, everyday legal, social and technical aspects of the Israel-Palestine conflict that are often missed by scholars and policy makers.","maroon"

Examples of such motions range from performing daily activities to breathing and heartbeat during sleep. These various scales of motions can be captured by fine-grained WiFi signals to perform continuous wellbeing monitoring. Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea). Using existing WiFi infrastructure for wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, outreaching to high school students, and engaging both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on building a WiFi enabled continuous wellbeing monitoring framework for fine-grained sleep monitoring and vital signs tracking at home environments. Users do not need to wear any sensors or actively participate in the monitoring process. The proposed framework targets to advance techniques in device-free fine-grained sleep events identification and vital signs tracking during sleep by utilizing existing WiFi signals. The proposed framework develops device-free localization strategies, vital signs tracking methods and statistical learning techniques to depict a comprehensive picture of users' wellbeing. Such wellbeing information is further utilized to assist in real-time disease prediction by leveraging today's ever-growing mobile environments. A hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model is developed to effectively mine through health conditions and identify risk factors of certain diseases. Chances of developing certain health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, is promptly predicted. The project also provides user-centric access control of archived wellbeing monitoring information to ensure data privacy and coping with distrusted servers.","olive"

Altogether, ICT could be very advantageous for producing innovation. At the same time, there could be drawbacks such as information overload or lack of attention to more focused formal communication channels. As a result of these concerns, this research aims to determine how ICT facilitates employee engagement in innovation, how ICT interacts with formal communication methods, and how the general social climate for innovation changes the ways that ICT affects work processes. With this knowledge, organizational decision makers will have better ideas of what to expect when new ICT systems are implemented, and have a better sense of what activities might emphasize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages.<br/><br/>This research aims to address three key research questions. First, how does ICT use shape employee engagement in innovation process, and in turn influence individual-level emergent states and outcomes? Second, how does ICT use interact with formal communication structure to shape intra- and inter-team dynamics in communication and knowledge creation, and to impact team-level emergent states and outcomes? Third, how does organizational climate for innovation shape the influence of ICT use on organizational innovation processes and outcomes? This project contributes to the literature by providing a theoretical model that explicates the influence of ICT use on individual and team innovation processes, extending the stream of literature on organizational learning by clarifying the most significant dynamic process, examining how organizational climate for innovation influences the effects of ICT use on innovation, and providing a clearly specified and rigorous mathematical model that facilitates future extension and integration with other theoretical models of learning and innovation.

Glasses constitute an important class of materials that combine the advantages of solids, including mechanical stability, with the advantages of liquids, including macroscopic spatial uniformity, making them ideal for a wide range of applications. Glasses, however, are inherently non-equilibrium materials, which makes their study and design particularly challenging. While familiar glasses are inorganic and polymeric, organic glasses of relatively low molecular weights are finding applications in electronics, bio-preservation, and drug delivery. The team seeks to create a knowledge base and develop design principles for the engineering of organic glasses. The effort builds on previous progress in the engineering of crystals and inorganic glasses, as well as recent discoveries in the field of organic glasses, in particular, the creation of high-density and high-stability glasses with tunable anisotropy by physical vapor deposition (PVD). <br/><br/>A concerted program of experiments and simulations will target three areas of organic glass engineering that have technological relevance and where current understanding is lacking: (1) controlling anisotropy, (2) controlling molecular conformation, and (3) inhibiting crystallization. Under Aim 1, the team will study the creation and control of anisotropy in organic glasses by PVD, external fields, and liquid-crystal order. Though often isotropic, glasses with controlled anisotropy have potential applications in data storage, non-linear optics, and laser technologies. Work under Aim 2 seeks to produce organic glasses while actively controlling molecular conformation. Conformational flexibility characterizes many molecular components of organic glasses; controlling conformation offers a unique opportunity in optimizing their properties (e.g., HOMO/LUMO levels and charge mobility). Under Aim 3, the team will stabilize organic glasses against crystallization using polymer additives. This capability will enable promising but easy-to-crystallize organic glasses to serve as durable amorphous materials. Work in all areas will be performed in a high-throughput manner, with simulations used to screen the selection of materials and conditions for experimentation, and to interpret experimental data. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>Glasses are amorphous materials that combine solid-like mechanical stability and liquid-like spatial uniformity, making them ideal for many applications ranging from telecommunication to bio-preservation. This research seeks to advance the science and technology of organic glasses, and the results will provide a foundation for designing organic glasses with desired properties through concerted use of simulations and targeted experiments. This research will benefit materials scientists and engineers in other fields where glasses and amorphous materials are important, and contribute to a broader perspective on the science of glasses in general. The improved ability to stabilize amorphous materials against crystallization will especially benefit pharmaceutical scientists as they develop amorphous formulations to deliver highly potent but poorly soluble drugs. Poor solubility is limiting the development of many drugs that would significantly advance health care in the U.S. and developing countries. In addition to journal publications, results from this work will be disseminated via a central website, a mechanism especially important for archiving and sharing the extensive data from high-throughput investigations.<br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the multi-disciplinary nature of this project, having significant exposure to simulations and experiments, crystals and glasses, and polymeric and low-molecular-weight materials. Personnel supported by this grant will work with UW-Madison's Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence (PEOPLE), which has a proven record of increasing the enrollment of minority and low-income high school students in colleges and universities. This program provides experiences that help students to become scientifically literate citizens and encourages them to consider careers in science and engineering.","goldenrod"

This requirement typically results in delays ranging from many hours to days between collection of material and its analysis. Hence, development of instrumentation that overcomes this impediment is seen as a priority. Previously, the PI's approached this problem through development of the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). The ESP is a field-deployable system that allows for application of molecular probe methodologies remotely in situ, including DNA and protein probe arrays, as well as real-time PCR. Applications of the ESP are currently restricted to moorings or benthic installations that can be embedded within a larger observatory framework. Since the number of moorings that can be deployed at any given time is limited and because they are fixed geographically, the ability to interrogate the ""patchiness"" of target communities and to assess their dynamics in response to changing environmental conditions from a remote perspective is limited. The PI's propose to overcome this limitation and compliment existing ocean observing technologies by modifying the ESP to fit on mobile platforms. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to fit the instrument on a 12"" diameter propeller-driven AUV, though the same device could also be integrated on other platforms as well (e.g., profiling mooring or float, drifter). This can be accomplished by repackaging and eliminating some elements of the current ESP, and by combining that device with a field deployable, multi-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor. Like the current ESP, the new instrument will be suitable for use with nucleic acid and protein-based assay chemistries, and support sample archiving so that material can be brought back to a laboratory for later analyses. However, its configuration will be aimed at fewer target species/metabolites for a given deployment, consistent with focused AUV reconnaissance operations. Such real-time detection capability will create unique opportunities for oceanographers and resource managers, particularly when placed within an integrated ocean observatory network. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/><br/>The educational and outreach benefits from numerous undergraduates, graduate students, post docs, technical staff, and senior faculty working with the ESPs through various projects; various summer internship programs provided by WHOI and Biosecurity, Inc. for undergraduates including minority students; Monterey Bay Aquarium has included the ESP in a program that runs twice a day reaching almost 300,000 people a year. Although one reviewer described the broader impacts as somewhat predictable, the PI's have a broad base of resources available to them and their ability to utilize these has been demonstrated in the past.","lavender"

In addition, algae predominated in late Paleozoic marine ecosystems. These observations, combined with predictions from climate modeling, prompt two over-arching hypotheses driving the proposed research: 1) the unusual tropical dustiness reflects dust production by tropical upland glaciers, and 2) atmospheric dustiness fertilized marine ecosystems. Dust forces the climate system by affecting radiative forcing and atmospheric moisture, and by influencing the biosphere, but these effects are poorly known. In this research, PIs will collect data to constrain spatial (low-mid latitude) and temporal (glacial-interglacial and longer) variations in atmospheric 'dustiness,' sources of the dust, and influences between dust and ecosystem composition in order to address their over-arching hypotheses, and clarify the relationships among atmospheric dustiness, climate, and the biosphere.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This research will reveal process links among dust, climate, and the biosphere within an icehouse, at glacial-interglacial scales. Owing to the known importance but great uncertainty of both the direct and indirect effects of dust on climate, results will expand understanding of Earth-system behavior. Tropical glaciation at low elevations implies much more widespread glaciation than currently accepted, and --if verified-- would force the community to test this hypothesis with new modeling approaches. The models to be used are identical to those used for present and future climate, and thus improvements made through the proposed work will inform modeling of Earth's climate in general. If the hypothesis that atmospheric dustiness forced marine biotic systems toward nutrient-rich conditions is confirmed, it implies a remarkably dusty Earth, and clarifies Earth-system behavior to dust-sourced fertilization. These results are relevant to growing discussions regarding geo-engineering schemes to control future climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Cross-disciplinary training will occur via exchanges between geological and geochemical labs, geologists and modelers, and in joint field excursions and progress meetings. PhD students will mentor middle-school teachers through a formal summer program. Undergraduates will conduct senior theses and present at Undergraduate Research Day and national meetings. Both will interact with middle- and high-school students through a formal course on STEM education. The lead investigators will use components of the research to teach at university levels, as well as in museum, and community outreach. Ties will be established and strengthened among all participant institutions, which includes an Historically Black University, as well as international partners.

However, the penetration depth of optical microscopy is limited due to the scattering and absorption of light within tissue. Thus, interrogating tissue and 3D cell cultures beyond (0.5 to 0.8) mm with high resolution and minimal photodamage from the required high-intensity illumination has been challenging. Magnetic fields, in contrast, penetrate biological samples without scattering or harm to the cells, providing the opportunity for a new imaging modality from magnetic nanoparticle microscopy as proposed here. Cells and cellular organelles may be labeled with magnetic nanoparticle tracers, which can then be imaged with high contrast and resolution. Magnetic nanoparticle microscopy is based on the principles of magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Briefly, a magnetic field distribution is established such that tracer particles everywhere within the sample except a small field free point are magnetically saturated. As a result, when an ac excitation field is applied, a response is elicited only from nanoparticles within the field free point. A 3D image of the nanoparticle concentration is constructed by scanning the field free point within the sample to spatially select the nanoparticles and measure their response inductively. Research on MPI has focused on the development of millimeter-scale resolution scanners with a field of view encompassing the whole human or small animal body. The proposed research seeks instead to scale magnetic particle imaging for sub cellular resolution. The experimental goal is to demonstrate 25 ï¿½m in a relevant biological specimen. A magnet field assembly will be implemented to provide the high field gradient needed for nearly two orders of magnitude finer resolution. The system hardware will be designed with low noise electronics to ensure maximal signal-to-noise ratio. Further, nanoparticle tracers of custom size and biocompatible coatings will be precision engineered with to meet the imaging requirements. A modular synthetic approach will allow the core and biocompatible coatings to be independently and systematically tailored, with exquisite control. Imaging capabilities will be demonstrated in embryonic zebrafish and verified via concurrent optical microscopy. Experiments proposed to qualify magnetic nanoparticle imaging will also advance ongoing research in identifying physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles that influence their uptake and thereby provide insight to their toxicity.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: <br/>This project forges an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaboration, bridging engineering, chemistry and biology, to meet the need for an imaging technology to explore new scientific frontiers in microbiology and medicine. The successful demonstration of cellular and sub cellular resolution will establish a new means of microscopy, using magnetic nanoparticle tracers, to investigate cell behavior in optically opaque, living tissue. Beyond fundamental biology, this effort will advance synthesis techniques for precisely engineered nanoparticles and bring new insight to nanoparticle interactions with living systems. Further, it will lay the foundation for applications envisioned in medical imaging of clinical skin and breast cancer screening. The PIs will involve 2 graduate and 4 undergraduate students in research. The participating students will gain a well<br/>-rounded technical education acquiring not only expertise in their respective areas of specialization but also knowledge of methods and materials in complementary areas of research. Suitable sub-topics within the project will be integrated in to cross disciplinary and discipline-specific courses taught by the PIs. The research findings will be published in relevant high-impact journals and presented at regional, national and international technical meetings. In addition, as discussed in the data management plan, final data will be archived and made available to the public. The PIs will serve K-12 education by developing grade-level appropriate instruction materials in collaboration with elementary, middle and high school science teachers. The PIs will also participate in Science Pubs, an informal science education program to engage the public in discussion on the synthesis, applications and implications of nanoparticles in medicine and biology.","wheat"

Structural characteristics of jobs such as social support, decision-making autonomy, and perceived significance are positively associated with outcomes such as job satisfaction and retention. However, effects of characteristics of jobs vary across gender, even when males and females occupy the same position. Differences are also evident in time allocation on faculty jobs: males spend more time engaged in research than females, who put more time into mentoring and service. Gendered patterns are especially pronounced among STEM faculty. While such differences have been well documented, we have little understanding why the work experiences of male and female faculty diverge. The proposed project uses work design theory as a lens for investigating the variability in work experiences and job outcomes across male and female STEM faculty, providing new insight into structural barriers that help and hinder underrepresented groups in STEM careers. The plan of work includes a three-wave longitudinal panel design survey, a 10-day daily experience sampling method study, a series of focus group interviews, and an archival review of promotion and tenure files. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>Lack of female role models discourages female participation in STEM careers; thus, increasing the number of female faculty in male dominated STEM fields is key to broadening participation of women in STEM. Findings from the theoretically derived proposed set of relationships will elucidate the complex interplay between top down and bottom up processes within organizations that contribute to alignment between individual and organizational goals and that can lead to the design of effective programs and interventions within organizations. Expected outcomes include a more nuanced understanding of the daily work experiences of female STEM faculty and how those experiences differ from their male counterparts. It is also expected that the findings will reveal micro level processes that inhibit the successful progression and retention of female faculty. This proposed research unites diverse expertise across several fields of science in effort to apply a multidisciplinary perspective to the research questions. The findings will be used to help inform and stimulate ways in which organizations can alter work design processes, in an effort to advance the careers of women in STEM. Funding will be used to support a doctoral student researcher. The doctoral student will gain research project management experience and be involved in products associated with the research (e.g., conference presentations; publications). The proposed project will also provide research experiences for undergraduates who will be supervised by the doctoral research assistant. Such experiences contribute to the development of a scientifically literate workforce in that undergraduates who participate in research have reported cognitive gains such as increased confidence in their ability to do science and learning to ""think and work like a scientist."" Developmental activities and experiences will include lab meeting and departmental presentations, scholarly article discussions, and written developmental plans.","crimson"

This manufacturing service system will enable highly functioning relationships between a range of users, including service consumers (e.g., designers, entrepreneurs, makers) and service producers (e.g., manufacturers). Design organizations and new entrepreneurs have limited access to the advanced manufacturing processes needed for innovation due to longstanding barriers associated with: (1) cost and availability of advanced manufacturing platforms and (2) technical skill and experience needed to design manufacturable products in a correct-by-construction framework. While direct-to-print paradigms, such as 3D printing, have increased the capabilities for users to make parts directly from digital product designs, the capital equipment for manufacturing functional components are still housed in mostly private enterprise facilities. Additionally, challenges to accurately specify product manufacturing requirements remain as barriers toward facilitating large-scale, consumer-driven manufacturing services. Smart manufacturing service systems that address these persistent challenges will dramatically accelerate innovation across multiple industrial sectors by removing technological barriers for functional manufacture. The consumerization of manufacturing services will also enable manufacturers with excess production capacity to access a significantly broader customer base, facilitating stabilization of production capacity through decentralization of service demand. Democratization of access to manufacturing capabilities and the associated sharing economy benefits will lead to transformative advances in product realization for the US economy.<br/><br/>To facilitate these collaborations, this research project leverages prior discovery for rapid, digital process planning based on novel hybrid dynamic tree representations and graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated parallel computing. To implement this novel discovery in a distributed service system, the digital process planning method will provide product and process intelligence for each user class. Human subjects experiments and user requirements modeling will inform system design for user interface functionality, service consumer cognitive processing, service provider informational needs, and consumer-to-producer interaction requirements. The service system architecture will be designed to interface with users, facilitate user transactions, receive and shape input data, and enable archival functionality. To realize the foundational digital process planning discovery in a novel human-centered service system, new information models for manufacturing-related data and service provider production capabilities will be established. Advanced computational algorithms will also be derived for scaling GPU-accelerated process analyses in a many-user, cloud-based environment. Comprehensive system testing will inform efficacy of the underlying user requirement models, service system architecture, manufacturing information models and GPU-accelerated computing for generalized human-centered manufacturing service systems.<br/><br/>The research project assembles a collaborative team of experts in the fields of manufacturing, design, computing and psychology and a diverse range of industrial partners and nonprofit agencies to realize a next-generation manufacturing service system. The lead institution is Georgia Tech with faculty from mechanical engineering, computing and psychology. The industrial partners, Tucker Innovations (small business), Mazak (large business), Morris South (large business), represent manufacturing technology developers and platform builders with interest in facilitating broad access of enterprise-level technologies to consumer end users. The partner industrial consortia, National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (non-profit), National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (non-profit) and Digital Manufacturing And Design Innovation Institute (non-profit), provide access to a strong membership base spanning many industrial sectors. Collaborations at Georgia Tech with The Center for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning, Vertically Integrated Projects Program and VentureLab will facilitate connections of research outcomes to educational outcomes for the broad community of makers.","tan"

The Cerrado consists of woodland savanna and is the second largest biome in Brazil. It also is one of the world's biodiversity hotspots. Global efforts to reduce carbon emissions and higher demand for ""clean,"" more sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels have led to the development of biofuel production in many parts of the world, including the Cerrado. A team of U.S.-based investigators and their Brazilian collaborators will determine how external factors, including biofuel demand and supply, sugarcane demand and supply, biofuel industry expansion, and government policy, impact farmers' decisions to produce sugarcane for biofuel production as well as other forms of land-use and land-cover change in the Cerrado. They will examine factors affecting farmers' decision making, and they will predict future land-use and land-cover change in the Cerrado under different biofuel market and policy scenarios. The investigators will collect a broad mix of qualitative and quantitative data using surveys and interviews. They will conduct archival research to provide a detailed understanding of the policy and macroeconomic context for the emergence of the sugarcane industry in the Cerrado, and they will analyze satellite-based remote sensing data to develop an data on land-use and land-cover change at the field level across the study region. They will develop a modeling framework to integrate conduct market analyses and farm-level household analyses in a comparative, longitudinal approach, with an emphasis placed on viewing sugar and ethanol processes as related to the equilibrium of supply and demand. The modeling also will provide a predictive platform to model the impacts of sugarcane production and expansion on land-cover change under different scenarios using actual field, farm, and market-level data. <br/><br/>This project will enhance basic understanding regarding on how market demand and supply and government policy have affected the behavior of both the ethanol industry and the farmers who are providing an increasing supply of sugarcane via land conversion in Brazil. It also will add insights and information regarding the extent to which existing agricultural cropland, pasture, and native vegetation are being converted to sugarcane. With bioenergy and its human and ecological impacts the subject of debate among policy makers and civil society in Brazil and elsewhere, project findings will have implications for conservation initiatives and sustainability. The project will contribute to graduate education and training at Kansas State University and the University of Kansas, and it will help build international partnerships between U.S.- and Brazilian-based researchers and students. The project will ensure future international collaboration on the impacts of bioenergy expansion in Brazil and create the basis for comparative work on U.S. and Brazilian energy geographies.","maroon"

With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Eric Jones will conduct archaeological research at Late Precontact (AD 1000-1600) sites in the southeastern United States to determine the landscape factors that influenced the formation of complex societies in this region. Examining the processes and circumstances surrounding how complexity was formed helps to determine the long-term social, political, and economic trajectories that have created modern conditions. Although archaeologists have made great strides in understanding how and why this process occurs, they are still learning. In particular, the reasons why complex societies arose and persisted in specific locations has rarely been studied and is thus not well understood. It is an important topic, however, because it can reveal the historical and cultural processes that have shaped the last 10,000 years of human history with regard to complexity. Specifically, it can improve understanding of historic and modern human geography because the distribution of societies of varying complexity impacted Native American-European interactions during the colonial period. Further, it can provide information about human interactions with the environment in relation to varying complexity.<br/><br/>The Southeast, particularly the Piedmont, is an ideal area to study the spatial and landscape components of complexity because it was one of the few areas of North America occupied simultaneously by complex and non-complex societies. Furthermore, this area has a long history of archaeological research and detailed accounts from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This three-year study will examine the environmental and cultural landscape features that influenced the patterning of societies of varying complexity. It will do this using a combination of archaeological excavation and survey, modeling of past landscapes using historical, geological, geographic, and environmental data, and geographic information systems (GIS)-based spatial analyses. The results will explain why some locations saw the development of social and political hierarchies and others did not. <br/><br/>With regard to broader impacts, Dr. Jones' research will be one of the few projects to examine and compare the landscapes of non-hierarchical and hierarchical societies in North America. Understanding the origins of social hierarchies and related landscapes has the potential to inform about our own social structure, specifically with regards to interactions with the environment. Undergraduates will be involved in all levels of research, including archival work, fieldwork, artifact and spatial analyses, and the presentation and publication of results. Each year Dr. Jones and students will organize public archaeology events inviting students, local residents, and representatives from local Native American communities to engage in conversations about local history, the importance of cultural historic preservation, and Native American cultures and history. Information from this research will also be integrated into the Wake Forest Museum of Anthropology and will be made available as a digital database for other researchers.","maroon"

The objective of the proposed project is to improve understanding of the physicochemical processes associated with the transport of hydraulic fracturing fluids through porous media and fractured media. This approach will allow a more detailed assessment of the potential adverse effects to the environment.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate the relationship between fluid composition and physical properties, sorption of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to solid media (i.e., proppants and shale), and the flow and transport of multicomponent, non-Newtonian fluids in porous and fractured media. Aqueous solutions of common fracturing chemicals will be characterized with respect to density and rheological properties. Batch tests will be conducted to measure the sorption of fracturing chemicals to relevant solid materials. Micro-models will be used to elucidate fluid flow characteristics on the pore/fracture scale. Flushing experiments will be conducted in one- and two-dimensional, homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Experiments will investigate the pressure-flow rate relationship for non-Newtonian fracturing fluids with a range of fluid compositions, and the transport of individual species within the fluid. Rigorous theoretical models will be developed in conjunction with the experimental work using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory framework. The experimental portion of the project will provide a comprehensive dataset at relevant temperatures and pressures regarding: (1) the effect of fluid composition on physical properties, (2) the sorption of hydraulic fracturing chemicals on relevant solid media, (3) the flow behavior of multicomponent, non-Newtonian fluids in realistic porous and fractured media systems, and, (4) dispersion of dissolved species in non-Newtonian fluids. The experimental work will be conducted in conjunction with modeling using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory approach. This method will result in the development of a macroscale model that is consistent with thermodynamic principles, and which allows for explicit identification of subscale processes and relationships between variables of interest. The development of such a model will greatly improve upon the existing state of modeling such systems, direct further experimental and computational work, and provide a consistent framework with which to better probe the fundamental aspects of complex fluid behavior in porous media. The project will disseminate the finding of the research by developing a web site, holding public forums, and participation in the UNCs Institute for the Environment IDEA program. In addition, the PI will: (1) contributions to education through course content, student research, and science outreach; (2) participation of underrepresented researchers and linkages to minority recruitment programs; (3) broad dissemination of findings in environmental engineering, environmental chemistry, and contaminant hydrology journals; (4) digital archiving and dissemination of unique data sets and video images of experiments; and, (5) expanded ties with international collaborators that work on complementary aspects of multiphase systems. In addition, the physical processes and chemical components chosen for this study are common to environmental remediation applications and will improve understanding of all such systems.","coral"

The larger space, more efficient storage and more secure cabinetry will ensure the preservation and future growth of one of the largest collections of historical and modern mammals and birds in the Northern Rockies. The move will be combined with an update to the database, making it compatible with international standards for collections data. Thus, information from all specimens held by the Museum will become broadly accessible to the general public. The Museum's extensive regional collection of birds and mammals provides a unique historical perspective on modern species distributions and genetic responses to landscape changes. The relocation and digitization of this substantial collection will provide training and discovery opportunities in biology and museum science for high school and undergraduate students, including summer internships for four students from Montana tribal colleges.<br/><br/>The project will provide urgently needed curatorial upgrades to the collection of more than 20,000 specimens of modern-day vertebrates at the University of Montana Zoological Museum (UMZM). As the largest collection of modern land vertebrate specimens from Montana, and among the largest such vertebrate collections in the northern Rocky Mountains, the UMZM provides an important source of materials for research, formal education, and outreach. Current University of Montana faculty are actively using the collections to study diverse questions biological questions, however, the potential for broader accessibility, ongoing specimen preservation, and future growth is severely limited by current infrastructure. Securing the collection will occur via transfer of all research specimens to new cabinets in an archival space. This move will also result in a fourfold increase of the area available to work with the specimens. Building on UM's active incorporation of the collections into undergraduate teaching and research, this project will increase outreach to the local public by new exhibits of UMZM collections centered on seasonal themes, training of K12 teachers to help incorporate biodiversity science into their curricula, and mentored internships at the UMZM of Native American students from regional tribal colleges. The project's activities will be documented at the UMZM's new website (hs.umt.edu/UMZM). The new database will, for the first time, allow web-based access to specimen data from the UMZM collections for academic and other researchers via VertNet and Arctos.

Yet many federal voluntary programs are finding it hard to increase rates of participation and/or compliance. More broadly, there is no explicit and comprehensive theoretical framework to explain the reasons for such low rates among communities. Accordingly, this work will develop a novel theoretical framework of community participation in federal voluntary programs for the mitigation of flood-related risk by integrating key insights from multiple disciplines such as political science, public administration, environmental economics, nonprofit management and sociology. This research will support policy making in the design and implementation of targeted policies to encourage communities to participate in federal voluntary programs, and improve compliance in areas such as community resilience to floods, environmental protection and adaptation, and critical infrastructure protection.<br/><br/>The scientific objective this work pursues is the development of a theory of participation in voluntary programs for flood risk mitigation, resulting in improved understanding of the factors that motivate communities to participate in federal voluntary programs in general. This study will address this objective in the context of the Community Rating System (CRS) through two guiding research questions: (1) What factors motivate communities to participate in the CRS program? (2) What are the differences between CRS participating communities and non-CRS participating communities with regard to flood risk management practices and contextual factors? The CRS, a Federal voluntary program designed to promote local flood resilience, is an appropriate testbed because only 5 percent of the over 22,000 eligible communities are participating in the CRS. Primary and secondary data sources will be used, including archival and interview data. Prior to conducting the interviews, the study will use Propensity Score Matching techniques to match 50 randomly selected CRS participating communities (treatment group) with 50 non-CRS participating communities (control group). The matching will be based on community-level characteristics such as population size, median housing values, and flood risk. The study's findings are expected to advance scientific understanding of the drivers of community participation in a host of federal voluntary programs.","navy_blue"

The SPARC program began in August 2013 with a grant from the NSF Archaeometry Program, and aims to expand the use of spatial analysis, 3D and geophysical remote sensing technologies in archaeological research projects around the world. The availability and sophistication of these technologies and methods has begun to profoundly affect how archaeologists and other scholars work. The things archaeologists study - from artifacts to sites to landscapes - almost always have a spatial component and for many decades space has been viewed as one of the central dimensions of archaeological study. The capabilities of geospatial technologies to enhance the discovery and interpretation not only offers new data, but also creates entirely novel means of engaging with the archaeological record. Through the SPARC Program high impact projects seeking to engage with geospatial technologies and methods are selected on the basis of peer reviewed applications. Technical experts and research staff at CAST actively collaborate with the selected projects, providing access to equipment, methodological and domain expertise, and intensive training. <br/><br/>Established in 2013 to promote the effective application of advanced geospatial methods the Program's goal is to: enhance the research productivity of archaeological projects by making geospatial technologies available to researchers who would not otherwise have access to the tools or skills needed to collect and analyze these data; directly generate high value archaeological data by participating in fieldwork and analytical projects to efficiently collect and analyze geospatial data; provide training opportunities for students and professionals seeking to use geospatial techniques in their own research; promote the development of new geospatial methods and applications in archaeology and the visibility of these innovations in the broader archaeological community; and support good practice and promote innovation in archiving and publication of digital geospatial data. The new support from the NSF Archaeometry program will allow SPARC to continue building a program that is increasingly visible - attracting top research projects; efficient - as project staff build on their experience; high impact - as pilot projects build skills in research teams around the world; and innovative - with broader collaborations leading to significant methodological advancements.","maroon"

NHERI will be comprised of separate awards for a Network Coordination Office, Cyberinfrastructure, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center, and Experimental Facilities, including a post-disaster, rapid response research facility. Awards made for NHERI will contribute to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. NHERI continues NSF's emphasis on earthquake engineering research infrastructure previously supported under the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation as part of NEHRP, but now broadens that support to include wind engineering research infrastructure. NHERI has the broad goal of supporting research that will improve the resilience and sustainability of civil infrastructure, such as buildings and other structures, underground structures, levees, and critical lifelines, against the natural hazards of earthquakes and windstorms, in order to reduce loss of life, damage, and economic loss. Information about NHERI resources will be available on the DesignSafe-ci.org web portal.<br/><br/>NHERI Experimental Facilities will provide access to their experimental resources, user services, and data management infrastructure for NSF-supported research and education awards. This award will support a NHERI Experimental Facility at Florida International University to conduct wind engineering research using the 12-fan Wall of Wind (WOW). The United States has learned very hard lessons in the last decade about its human, economic, and infrastructure vulnerabilities to wind hazard events. The WOW is a windstorm simulation facility that allows testing of holistic building systems and other structures at multiple scales in wind speeds up to and including hurricane Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with a wind-driven rain option. The WOW will allow researchers to generate new and highly specific knowledge on wind damage and rain intrusion mechanisms. The goal is to improve design practices for structural and building envelope systems and lifeline infrastructures to create more wind-resilient and sustainable communities. The WOW will also promote student learning as part of the larger national effort to foster a diverse and globally competitive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. More broadly, the WOW will serve the national interest by promoting the progress of wind engineering science and technology; generating innovations that can lead to reductions in life, property, and infrastructure losses; and supporting research needed to prevent wind hazard events from becoming community disasters. <br/><br/>The WOW facility will provide the following experimental capabilities: (1) high-speed holistic testing at multiple scales in simulated hurricane wind speeds up to and including Category 5; (2) wind-driven rain simulations to study water intrusion; (3) testing under extreme environments to develop innovative mitigation devices; (4) large-scale aerodynamic/aeroelastic testing in atmospheric boundary layer flows at high Reynolds numbers; and (5) classic boundary layer wind tunnel small-scale testing in flows with a full turbulence spectrum. The WOW will offer a wide range of instrumentation and data acquisition systems, and will allow wind load data to be obtained for a wide range of building shapes, accounting for interference and shielding effects not addressed in current design standards. The archived database will help researchers study peak loads and validate computational methods. Holistic testing of integrated component assemblies will help determine fragilities, progressive failure modes, and rain intrusion mechanisms. Research using the WOW will help validate sustainable building concepts and innovative mitigation strategies. Knowledge gained from large-scale tests will enable researchers to develop more energy efficient and smart building envelopes, identify on-site renewable energy sources, and implement natural ventilation strategies. Strategic partnerships will add capabilities to allow use of aerodynamic data on straight winds in designs for tornadoes and downbursts. Research conducted at the facility will contribute to incorporating new findings into standards and improving current practices. The university's STEM Transformation Institute will help incorporate its program into the facility's educational component, fostering a new intellectual infrastructure with inquiry-based active learning and Learning Assistant modules, which will be transportable to wind engineering curricula in the United States and around the world. This facility will conduct annual workshops for prospective users and will host Research Experiences for Undergraduate students.","navy_blue"

Many of these changes negatively affect coral reef ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide food, arable land, tourist destinations and coastline protection for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This project focuses on the effects of enhanced stratification, caused by ocean warming, on the growth of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Enhanced stratification impacts primary productivity which generates food for corals. Initial data generated by the investigators suggest that Atlantic coral growth has declined in the last 5 decades in response to these changes. A laboratory-based experiment is designed to test this hypothesis. If verified, the projected decline in Atlantic primary productivity through the 21st century could potentially rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems across the North Atlantic. Support is provided for graduate research, and undergraduate participation is facilitated through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Summer Fellowship and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences-Princeton Environmental Institute Summer Internship Programs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and disseminated in a timely manner through peer-reviewed publications. All data produced through this program will be archived in the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a principle threat to coral reef survival in the 21st century. In addition to ocean warming and acidification, global climate models project enhanced stratification of the upper oceans through the 21st century and a consequent decline in productivity, by up to 50%, in the North Atlantic. This project employs controlled laboratory manipulation experiments to test the link between productivity and growth of the dominant reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Preliminary data generated by the investigators, including multi-decade long coral growth histories and nitrogen isotope ratios of coral tissue and skeleton, suggest that coral growth across the region has declined over the past 50 years in response to productivity changes already underway. If the link between ocean circulation, productivity decline, and coral growth is verified, the projected 21st century decline in productivity could rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on North Atlantic coral reef ecosystems.","lavender"

If the mechanisms can be better understood, then the uncertainties associated with making climate predictions on these timescales can be assessed more accurately. Decadal variability over the Pacific is of particular interest in the United States due to its downstream influence over the western United States and its direct influence on climate in Alaska. This project addresses the fundamental question of what are the predictability limits, mechanisms, and regional impacts for decadal modes of the Pacific climate system using a hierarchy of climate models and modern statistical tools. The results of this project will be important in assessing how long-term changes in the environment drive changes in economically important variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, snowfall, temperatures, as well as oceanic temperatures, currents and sea levels, which impacts fisheries, agriculture, and coastal infrastructure along the U.S. West Coast and Asian Marginal Seas. The tools developed in this project should be transferable to other global sectors that also exhibit decadal variability. The project team will mentor graduate students and post-docs, whose educational experiences will include cross-disciplinary exposure to ocean science, atmospheric science, and societal impacts that will be unique in this context. Community outreach will include lectures and educational presentations in public forums, mentoring K-12 students, educating grass-roots climate action organizations, informing the media, and posting research results on web pages.<br/><br/>There is clearly a large gap in our understanding of what controls Pacific decadal climate variability, what limits the predictability of the flows, and what practical skill might be useful in regional impacts on land and in the ocean. The project team proposes a coordinated research effort to better understand the basic physical dynamics of Pacific decadal variability and assess the skill of Pacific decadal predictability, along with its uncertainties and practical value. The research focuses on Community Earth System Model (CESM), with its vast repository of archived runs supplemented with targeted predictability experiments. The analysis focuses on using sophisticated statistical models (Linear Inverse Models) to identify statistical relations among variables, diagnose physical processes, and isolate potentially predictable components of the flows. It also involves using regional coupled atmosphere-ocean, along with uncoupled ocean and atmosphere models, to enhance the understanding of regional response and its potential for practical use in forecasting. The project brings together scientists skilled with developing decadal climate diagnostics, making both statistical and dynamical predictions, and executing regional coupled climate downscaling and regional high-resolution ocean modeling.","lavender"

Many Quaternary paleosols are laterally extensive, readily correlated, and suggestive of periods of regional climatic or geomorphic stability. This grant focuses on organic matter (OM) in paleosols. The objectives of this grant are (1) to identify and rank the importance of mechanisms of OM stabilization at the millennial scale, and (2) to significantly refine paleovegetation reconstructions of midcontinent, Late-Quaternary environments. At five sites in Kansas and Nebraska, OM will be studied in buried paleosols as old as 44.6 ka. These paleosols were chosen (1) to characterize paleosol organic matter in the two most widespread surficial materials in the Midcontinent (alluvium and loess), (2) to compare OM that has witnessed primarily aerated conditions (loess soils) with OM that has been subjected to alternating aerated and saturated condition (alluvial soils); (3) to systematically lengthen the periods in which OM has been buried, giving opportunity for early diagenetic changes to occur; and (4) to capitalize on information available from previous studies.<br/>This project will improve understanding of which components of soil organic matter are preserved over millennial time scales and why they are preserved. Such understanding will inform reconstructions of Quaternary paleoenvironments and landscapes that are based on OM-hosted proxies. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that a significant component of stable carbon in paleosols consists of charcoal.<br/>By evaluating the significance of charcoal in paleosol OM, the roles that fire can play in carbon storage, landscape evolution, and interpretations of paleoclimate can be elucidated. Because some forms of OM bind together mineral particles, paleosol OM components may regulate the ability of sediments to resist erosion, thus impacting landscape evolution. The research will also help to refine geochemical models that predict the amount of carbon that can be effectively sequestered in soils and provide new insights concerning the long-term stability of terrestrial OM and its impact on global carbon cycles.<br/>This project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups in earth sciences through collaboration with colleagues and students at Alabama A&M Univ. AAMU students be invited to join the research team during summer sessions as part of ISU's George Washington Carver Summer Internship program and they will be recruited for graduate studies at Iowa State Univ. and Univ. of Iowa.","hot_pink"

Microbes account for most of the primary productivity and biomass in the ocean, and the structure of the microbial community determines in large part that of higher trophic levels. A fundamental understanding of the factors that regulate community structure requires detailed and sustained observations of the plankton, which motivated the PIs to develop in situ flow cytometric and imaging-in-flow techniques that measure individual-cell light scattering and fluorescence properties, and utilize automated image analysis to determine taxonomic affiliation of the larger cells. While the instrument designs have proven and effective, two enhancements will enable new research applications. The first challenge to be addressed is that large cells are often under-sampled by current instruments. Acoustic focusing will increase sampling rate by > 10-fold and thus provide a far better look at these cells, facilitating studies of in situ growth rates of different phytoplankton species, and potentially making possible species-level studies of microbial predator activity. The second challenge to be addressed is the need for physical capture of cells for in depth analysis. Emulsion microfluidics techniques will facilitate image-based cell sorting of field samples by allowing the required image analyses to be carried out in a delayed laboratory procedure. After returning the stored cells to the laboratory, analysis of the image corresponding to each stored cell will be carried out, and the stored cells sorted as desired by a novel microfluidic device.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/> This instrument if successful will be capable of statistically quantitative sampling of pico, nano and microplankton with underwater deployment times as long as half a year. The samples archived in the instrument will permit unprecedented insights into the dynamics of the planktonic ecosystem. If made available commercially (which is in the works) instruments of this type could be key elements for biological sampling on moored ocean observing systems. The proposal has a significant training aspect with the inclusion of two graduate students as well as the collaboration with the Zephyr foundation on the development of a phytoplankton 'unit' in their educational program aimed to high school students. The signs of global change are clear, but the ramifications of these changes are not well constrained because of our limited knowledge of ecosystem responses. The proposed improvements to the IFCB will provide a means to directly observe responses of the primary producers in the natural environment as conditions change.

An increase in environmental disasters around the world compounded by a possible increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme climatic events and an increased probability of their occurrence in different locations poses serious challenges for people. This research project investigates the way that communities adapt from one disaster to another by examining coastal Louisiana's shift from frequent hurricanes to the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. Such a transition increases dependence on others, and dependence, instead of or in addition to self-reliance, is addressed as a missing cornerstone of research on community adaptation. As a result, external linkages become more important as communities depend on nonlocal inputs. The research focuses on the dynamic interactions between external linkages and internal community cohesion and capability that facilitate the penetration of external resources and knowledge at the community level. The project applies and tests an innovative approach to coupling community management with the theories of organizational innovation. The investigation begins with the structured content analysis of archival and documentary evidence and key informant interviews. The data analysis addresses the effects of changed regulatory structures on community adaptation to disasters and the extent to which previous adaptations to adverse environmental events can increase community vulnerability. It is followed by the selection of two of the most impacted communities in coastal Louisiana to examine whether dependence on external resources and knowledge after the oil spill has increased. It will also investigate the nature of the dependence and external linkages of these communities using participant observation and in-depth interviews. The project culminates with the collection of survey data to assess the communities' ability to absorb resources and knowledge. Data analysis using multilevel structural equation model will evaluate the relationship between internal and external linkages and the role of boundary organizations in the examination of community adaptation and innovation. <br/><br/>This project provides an improved understanding of vulnerability to new threats at the community level. It enables governments and aid agencies to formulate plans and policies to foster and sustain those external linkages necessary for anticipatory adaptation to future disasters. It also encourages and supports the capacity of communities to absorb new resources and information. This research also contributes to advancing knowledge regarding multiple hazards approach by studying and comparing the effects of different hazards and their adaptation mechanisms in the same location. Results from this research will be of utility to emergency managers, policy makers, and community leaders concerned with climate change, hazards, and disaster management. In addition, the integrative education plan focuses on student-society interactions and peer mentorship. Student participation at local workshops and service learning will provide students with valuable experiences. This project also includes the participation of undergraduate and graduate students and offers new courses and summer scholar programs. These educational activities will help students build careers in adaptation research and practice.","maroon"

SEAD will enable new modalities of sustainability science - the study of dynamic interactions between nature and society. Advancing the science of sustainability requires integration of social science, natural science, and environmental data at multiple spatial and temporal scales that is rich in local and location-specific observations; referenced for regional, national, and global comparability and scale; and integrated to enable end users to detect interactions among multiple phenomena. SEAD will respond to the expressed needs of sustainability science researchers for long-term management of heterogeneous data by developing new capabilities for data integration, dissemination, and long-term preservation. SEAD will provide researchers with tools for active curation and use social networking to engage data producers and users in community curation, gradually shifting curatorial and collection development responsibilities from professional curators to the producer and user communities. Our focus is on the ""long tail"" of social and environmental data: derived data products, data collections from individual PI's and small group investigations, and data sets of local, regional or topical significance that are critical to sustainability science but are of limited value until they can be referenced geo-spatially and temporally, combined with related data and observations, and modeled consistently. SEAD will make data accessible to diverse users, including domain scientists, local, national and international policy makers, manufacturers of sustainable technologies, citizen scientists, and informed consumers. SEAD will take advantage of existing robust digital library and institutional repository (IR) infrastructures at the three universities for access, storage, and preservation to ensure wide accessibility of data, linkages between data and scientific publications, and persistence.<br/><br/>SEAD will serve researchers efficiently and in a financially sustainable way via active curation, make innovative use of social networking, integrate data with existing digital library infrastructures, and provide synthesis services that significantly increase the research and societal value of data. Our work will establish a new active curation paradigm that can be readily integrated into the scientific workflow and that leverages social networking technologies to engage the science community in data curation. Our research program will produce novel solutions to the synthesis of heterogeneous data across different levels of spatio-temporal granularity and scope; management of logical contexts and data models; appropriate sharing of data with privacy and proprietary restrictions; and preservation through emulation and migration-based-technologies and policies for distributed stewardship. Our cyberinfrastructure development work will support a network of repositories that functions on several levels: locally through integration of SEAD data into campus digital library/repository infrastructures, inter-institutionally through a model for distributed data curation and storage, and nationally and internationally by extending our approach to other IRs, other DataNet Partners, sensor and observational networks, and topical data archives. Our financial sustainability plan will identify appropriate incentive mechanisms and business models based on a tight coupling of preservation and access services with research library managed IR infrastructure and ongoing involvement of scientists and users.<br/><br/>SEAD will build national and global capabilities for science-informed sustainability policy and planning in land use, natural resource management, agriculture, energy, economic development, ""green"" manufacturing, and related areas where critical decisions will be made in the next decade. The project will engage the community that preserves and shares scientific data, thus enhancing the public investment in scientific research and making taxpayer funded data widely available and easier to use which will provide high-value cost-effective curation and preservation capabilities through partnerships with other ""small science"" domains.","mauve"

This is certainly the case for field studies of animal behavior, where investigators can seldom focus on more than one or a few species and locales. Comparative research in the behavioral sciences is also hindered by a lack of standards and transparency across research groups as well as a shortage of modern tools and technologies for collecting and managing behavioral data. This project will address these challenges developing strategies and technologies for behavioral research using the collective experience of database specialists, software developers, and field primatologists, a community chosen because it has a vibrant interest in these issues.<br/><br/>There are four key goals to this project:<br/>1. To engage field primatologists and database specialists in developing open data standards that encompass the diversity of the discipline.<br/>2. To create and test a software system for data collection and management that puts these standards into practice. The system will be easily customized and able to run on a variety of mobile devices. Additionally the plans and software source code for it will be published openly for others to review, use, and improve upon.<br/>3. To develop additional software tools that will help behavioral researchers migrate existing data to work with this new system.<br/>4. To encourage researchers and institutional librarians to develop a vision for long-term archiving and curation of behavioral data.<br/><br/>The project will also produce tools for data visualization and analysis, which should encourage investigators to incorporate real-time visual and statistical feedback into their research in both the field and laboratory. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of modern field primatology, this framework is expected to be broadly applicable to researchers from across the social, behavioral, economic, and natural sciences.<br/><br/>This project aims to build an interdisciplinary community of behavioral researchers involving both junior and established scholars. Its products will enable these researchers to collect data more quickly and efficiently while expanding the scope and utility of their data beyond their immediate research questions. Through workshops, tutorials, and documentation, community members will become increasingly data- and design-literate, which will encourage more comparative, ""big data"" projects and spur collaboration across disciplines. A working repository for behavioral data will help foster a culture of data-sharing among researchers. Through an extensive online presence, the project team will communicate with the public about the progress of this project and about the practice of fieldwork, laboratory work, and science in general. The open nature of the project will enable the public to freely adopt and modify any of this project's products for varied and novel purposes. Finally, because the majority of researchers involved in this project are fieldworkers and educators with influence both in the United States and abroad, the ideas and tools produced will be widely disseminated, providing opportunities for education, outreach, and community participation in science.","aquamarine"

Interpretation of reconstructions based on tree-ring growth is complicated by the potential loss of information when raw tree-ring observations are combined into chronologies, and by the variety of climate influences on tree-ring growth. <br/><br/>This research tests for the influence of detrending methodology and multivariate climate control on tree-ring records across the Arctic using both archival data and newly developed high-latitude chronologies. The process leading to tree-ring based climate reconstructions will be modeled, starting with climate influences on tree growth and progressing through sampling and chronology construction. This framework will then be used to test hypotheses about the influence of climate processes and methodological approaches on the resulting chronologies, placing particular attention to the effects of detrending and light availability on climate reconstructions. New tree-ring cores from high-latitude sites will also be collected in order to test for an influence of small-scale variability in the light environment on tree-ring growth. This project and its associated methodological advances will improve understanding of tree-ring based climate proxies and lead to improved climate reconstructions. Codes and data generated in the course of the project will be made publically available.

Currently, just over half of written constitutions in the world include a ""right to health"" in seemingly enforceable language. Whether this is beneficial to health outcomes and health policy, however, is not clear. Prominent ethicists suggest it should benefit public health policy while many legal experts have voiced skepticism -- yet little empirical evidence is currently available. This project uses a mix of quantitative analysis and qualitative field research to examine the effects of institutionalizing health as a constitutional right. If a right to health does operate to improve health -- expanding the power of civil society, the legal system, and health-related officials to improve health policy and health outcomes -- then it could be a powerful tool to improve the wellbeing of individuals in society. If not, it may problematically distort health policy. This project seeks to build scientific knowledge through interdisciplinary research, addressing these unanswered questions for the fields of law, public health, and political science. While the United States lacks an explicit constitutional right, health policy is increasingly legalized and, with the Affordable Care Act, the role of the state in health and of courts as arbiters is expanding. As such, lessons from this study may provide insights applicable to a U.S. context. In addition, this research may help national security and aid agencies implement more effective global health programs by identifying when, if, and how legal institutions can improve health policymaking. Globally, the average national constitution is significantly rewritten every 20 years, so whether a right to health is meaningful, and what factors make it so, are important pieces of information for constitution drafters and the health policymakers. <br/><br/>This study sets out to assess, in comparative perspective, the operation and effect of a constitutional right to health as an institution within the political economy health. Bringing insights and tools from political economy to the study of public law can help expand the emerging field of comparative constitutionalism -- in this case bridging the gap between existing normative and doctrinal studies of socioeconomic rights and the large field of empirical research on health and social policy. Adding to scientific knowledge on the production function of population health is also a goal. This project does so through mixed-methods ""nested analysis"" in South Africa, India, and Thailand that combines a large-N statistical regression with small-N fieldwork-based case studies. First, the study will construct a global panel dataset with national health, demographic, economic, and constitutional characteristics spanning 40 years and use multilevel regression analysis to examine the empirical relationship globally between a right to health and health outcomes. If the study's hypotheses are correct, there should be observably better health outcomes in countries with a right to health, controlling for the dominant economic, demographic, and political explanations for national wellbeing. Second, the study will gain causal leverage by seeking evidence directly linking the right to health with pro-health policymaking through field work in South Africa, India, and Thailand. Within-case analysis of interview and archival data will allow ""process tracing"" of recent health and health-related policymaking to help determine whether the statistical relationship observed in the large-N analysis is causal. Ultimately, data from this project should provide strong evidence about whether and how a constitutional right to health affects public health outcomes -- with implications for health policy, constitution-writing, and legal reform.","crimson"

To accomplish these goals this research will extend a longitudinal study of a key cohort of young women's experiences of cultural and economic change to examine and explain important outcomes in their lives. In doing so, this research will provide experience-near data on processes of globalization as mediated by education. It will also assess and report on outcomes in relation to both local and global indicators of adolescent well-being including identification of points for policy and practice interventions. Through a mixed-methods ethnographic approach using interviews, surveys, and archival research, this study utilizes a unique opportunity to track iterative processes of individuals within their changing cultural context over time in order to explain (i.e. not simply describe) significant outcomes in their lives. <br/><br/>This project aims to advance theory on subjective processes involved in globalization for young people with a focus on intracultural variation, education, and subjective experience. Specifically, this study applies a human development perspective to youth-related globalization theories to articulate the iterative processes of personal meaning making and rapid cultural and institutional change.

Preliminary research shows that sonomicrometry, which uses ultrasound to measure deformation, can be used successfully to measure strain in cartilage. The research will advance our knowledge and understanding about the function of cartilage as a structural material in vertebrates by quantifying strain during in vitro and in vivo loading. The study will also open multiple avenues of study on other biological materials that are not amenable to traditional strain analysis.<br/><br/>A broad range of chondrichthyan and chondrostean fishes that vary morphologically and kinematically in jaw and hyoid structures will be studied during feeding and ventilation behaviors with five aims. Morphological variation will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometrics. Mechanical properties will be measured in vitro to provide baseline data to assess the function of cartilage as a structural material. Strain in living fishes will be measured to examine cartilage performance as a skeletal element, providing a technique and baseline for measuring strain in non-bony skeletal elements. Finite element analysis will be validated from in vivo species and used to predict strain in those species or structures that are not amenable to in vivo techniques. Cartilage performance, behavior, and morphology will be analyzed phylogenetically to uncover ecological and evolutionary patterns.

The researchers will examine shifting land use and forest-conservation practices across an urban-to-rural gradient between Boston and central Massachusetts. They will combine new data collection through focus groups, a mail survey, interviews, and archival research with existing ecological and spatial data to meet four research objectives: (1) to characterize the patterns of conservation and land-management practices along the urban-to-rural gradient over the past 30 years; (2) to compare the influence of land use and management on key attributes of forested ecosystems and the provision of ecosystem services along the urban-to-rural gradient over the past 30 years; (3) to analyze the ways in which socioecological processes have shaped conservation and land-management practices; and (4) to characterize the strength of coupling among human development, conservation, and ecosystem services.<br/><br/>This project will advance basic understanding of the interactions among human development, conservation, and ecosystem services across urban-rural gradients. In particular, it will shed light on the ways and degrees to which social and ecological processes are coupled and if and how these differ along the gradient. The project will uncover ways in which increasing development alters the possibilities for conservation, carbon sequestration, and the provision of other ecosystem services from forests by changing biophysical characteristics and by changing the relationship between people and their surroundings. The project also will illuminate the importance of ecosystem characteristics and services in shaping conservation and land-management practices relative to other social, political, and economic factors. Such understanding will enhance the capacity for conservation efforts and the protection of ecosystem services in urban, suburban, and rural areas in and beyond the study region.

In addition, algae predominated in late Paleozoic marine ecosystems. These observations, combined with predictions from climate modeling, prompt two over-arching hypotheses driving the proposed research: 1) the unusual tropical dustiness reflects dust production by tropical upland glaciers, and 2) atmospheric dustiness fertilized marine ecosystems. Dust forces the climate system by affecting radiative forcing and atmospheric moisture, and by influencing the biosphere, but these effects are poorly known. In this research, PIs will collect data to constrain spatial (low-mid latitude) and temporal (glacial-interglacial and longer) variations in atmospheric 'dustiness,' sources of the dust, and influences between dust and ecosystem composition in order to address their over-arching hypotheses, and clarify the relationships among atmospheric dustiness, climate, and the biosphere.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This research will reveal process links among dust, climate, and the biosphere within an icehouse, at glacial-interglacial scales. Owing to the known importance but great uncertainty of both the direct and indirect effects of dust on climate, results will expand understanding of Earth-system behavior. Tropical glaciation at low elevations implies much more widespread glaciation than currently accepted, and --if verified-- would force the community to test this hypothesis with new modeling approaches. The models to be used are identical to those used for present and future climate, and thus improvements made through the proposed work will inform modeling of Earth's climate in general. If the hypothesis that atmospheric dustiness forced marine biotic systems toward nutrient-rich conditions is confirmed, it implies a remarkably dusty Earth, and clarifies Earth-system behavior to dust-sourced fertilization. These results are relevant to growing discussions regarding geo-engineering schemes to control future climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Cross-disciplinary training will occur via exchanges between geological and geochemical labs, geologists and modelers, and in joint field excursions and progress meetings. PhD students will mentor middle-school teachers through a formal summer program. Undergraduates will conduct senior theses and present at Undergraduate Research Day and national meetings. Both will interact with middle- and high-school students through a formal course on STEM education. The lead investigators will use components of the research to teach at university levels, as well as in museum, and community outreach. Ties will be established and strengthened among all participant institutions, which includes an Historically Black University, as well as international partners.

Much is known about how intertidal algae react to natural stresses, but little is known about the natural community of bacteria associated with these algae. Past studies in the laboratory found that some 'seaweeds' disintegrate after removal of their bacteria with antibiotics suggesting these bacteria are essential to the health of their hosts. This research will examine the genetic, taxonomic, and functional aspects of biodiversity of bacteria associated with several 'seaweeds' that are particularly important to the general health of marine ecosystems. The research will determine how these bacteria change with season, position within the intertidal zone and latitudinal range. Stability or change in the bacterial species associated with a host will be examined by studying the particular bacterial genes that are present at different sampling times and by studying host responses to inoculations with particular bacteria. The work will also study whether any bacteria are inhibited by the environmental extremes found across the intertidal zone or over latitude, especially at the southern borders of a host's range where climate change may disturb the bacterial community on the host. Researchers will deposit isolates and voucher specimens into public collections, and, in collaboration with trained citizen scientists, will provide digital access to all algal materials within the University of Maine Herbarium. The multi-faceted data collected during this research will aid studies by other intertidal ecologists.<br/><br/> How macroalgal microbiomes change in space and time is poorly known. Is there a 'cool, wet' versus a 'hot, dry' macroalgal microbiome(s)? If so, how does this affect host function? Here, microbiomes will be characterized over the vertical gradient of the intertidal zone on the Maine shore in differentially zoned species within each of two prominent genera, Fucus (rockweed) and Porphyra (laver). Contemporaneously, a trans-Atlantic study of microbiomes of the mid-zone Porphyra umbilicalis and Fucus vesiculosus will determine whether compositional changes found over an intertidal stress gradient are mirrored over the latitudinal range of mid-zoned species. If so, does this matter? This question will be answered by using shotgun metagenomic analyses to compare the genetic composition with the characterized taxonomic composition of the macroalgal microbiomes. Environmental variation associated with microbiome collections will be measured with in situ sensors and from archival and real time data available from government climate services (e.g., NOAA). The potential to detect changes over historic time will be assessed using herbarium specimens. To study bacteria that are likely to be most critical to normal structure and function of Fucus and Porphyra, the researchers will focus on bacterial isolations from spores and fertilized eggs, aided by flow cytometry and single cell genomics. To establish the criticality of these associations, microbiome-depleted embryos will be inoculated with such bacterial isolates, and the resulting interaction will be investigated by analysis of the host transcriptome with RNA-Seq. The temperature tolerance of key bacterial species (operational taxonomic units) will be established in laboratory experiments. This research will serve as an important trans-Atlantic baseline of the biodiversity of macroalgal microbiomes.","salmon"

Sedimentological analysis of these deposits enable investigation of fundamental geologic questions related to arc generation, maintenance, and destruction processes. These include: (1) the rates, timing, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, 2) identification of systematic patterns or variance in the time series of volcanic eruptions in terms of eruptive style, eruption magnitude, and repose periods, (3) assessing the completeness of the onshore record, especially if the marine record contains events not archived onshore, and (4) the nature of volcanism during the construction of a volcanic complex (magma evolution, production rate, eruptive styles, spatio-temporal distribution of eruptive vents and products, and importance of constructional vs. destructional processes). This information is essential to inform assessments of present-day hazards from active arc volcanoes. However, while constraining the long term eruptive history of a volcanic arc before the start of written historical records or beyond well-preserved subaerial tephra fall deposits (often representing only a few thousand years) is important, it is inherently difficult. <br/><br/>Key to establishing an accurate geologic record is the development of a methodology capable of accurate, replicable, quantitative, and routine identification of these tephra layers in marine sediment sequences. Traditionally, tephrochronologic methods have been applied to visible tephra beds that are typically characterized by discrete, often dark-colored depositional layers. This limits tephrochronology studies to areas proximal to volcanic sources capable of producing voluminous deposits. Cryptotephras, fine layers of ash that may not be visible to the naked eye, may either represent smaller eruptions or eruptions from more distal sources. Identification of cryptotephra has now become essential in order to fully constrain the eruptive history of a volcanic center. Previously cryptotephra have been identified by a variety of time-intensive and destructive methods. The goal of this proposal is to document and characterize different sedimentary properties and semi-quantitatively identify the distribution and magnitude of cryptotephras in the sediment record at millimeter scale resolution from the surrounding sedimentary matrix using high resolution continuous scanning techniques. These techniques include: (1) magnetic measurements, particularly magnetic susceptibility; (2) reflectance spectroscopy; (3) core XRF scanning using the ITRAX system; and (4) Computer Tomography (CT) scans. While these four techniques have demonstrated their potential for the identification of tephra, they have rarely been used together, especially at the resolution required to document cryptotephra. Combining these three methodologies will provide a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic, and spectral properties of sediment, all of which have independently been shown to vary substantially with the presence of tephra and also allow evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques for cryptotephra identification. The described techniques will be applied to IODP cores drilled off Montserrat to establish a long term tephrochronologic record of Montserrat and to better constrain the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc. This research will generate: (1) an expanded geologic history of the volcanic system driving Montserrat and an associated hazard assessment; (2) a better understanding of the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc; and (3) an evaluation of a set of techniques that can be used to rapidly identify cryptotephra layers in sediment sequences by non-destructive means.","hot_pink"

It is directly connected to and dependent upon other subcortical structures, especially the basal ganglia. Traditionally, the basal ganglia were known to regulate motor functions. Recently, however, they have been revealed to be active in advanced cognition, and their regulation of prefrontal cortical activity demonstrates that they are as important as the neocortex in processes such as language, learning, and memory. The goal of the present research is to examine the role of the basal ganglia in human cognitive development by comparing metabolic and modulatory components across a wide range of primate species, including humans and our closest living relative, the chimpanzee. The methods will combine advanced stereology with immunohistochemistry in order to quantify neuron to glia ratios, neuromodulatory neurons, and neuromodulator axons within key basal ganglia areas. This study will provide new knowledge about these subcortical structures, including any reorganization that may have occurred during human evolution. This will help distinguish our basal ganglia from those of other primates, promote understanding of how they changed during primate evolution, and how phylogenetic differences may relate to cognitive processing.<br/><br/> The research also may contribute substantially to understanding the etiology of major neuropathologies, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases, by identifying how humans differ from other species in the basal ganglia regions most affected by these diseases. Histological sections and slides of many primate species will be generated, archived, and made available to other researchers for additional comparative studies. This work also will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, including those enrolled in the McNair Scholars Program, which prepares individuals from under-represented groups for doctoral study.","maroon"

To achieve this aim, the investigator will develop paleoceanographic reconstructions of intermediate water nutrient concentration and provide the first continuous high-resolution (interannual-decadal scale) records of intermediate water biogeochemistry that will extend modern instrumental records. These records will advance our understanding of mechanisms linking rapid variations in atmospheric/surface ocean climate, upwelling, productivity, and deep-sea carbon and nutrient cycling. The investigator will integrate the research into educational activities by establishing a new coral geochemistry research program at a small liberal arts college and support participation of under-represented groups in ocean sciences at both the undergraduate and high-school level.<br/><br/>The impact of climate change on processes such as upwelling, nutrient availability, carbon export and ocean biogeochemistry is currently poorly understood. Paleoceanographic records can provide critical perspective on the mechanisms linking climate, the carbon cycle, and ocean oxygenation in the past. The investigator will use high-resolution (interannual-decadal) geochemical records from deep-sea bamboo corals to reconstruct past changes in nutrient cycling and carbon export for the past 400 years. The study is focused around a central question: How are deep-sea nutrient biogeochemistry and carbon cycling in the California Current System affected by climate change? Trace elemental ratios preserved in bamboo coral skeleton (Ba/Ca) will be used to determine whether changes in surface-ocean-atmospheric climate affect intermediate water mass nutrient cycling on decadal timescales. In particular, this study will closely investigate the last 400 years with a focus on: (1) validating the use of an established intermediate water nutrient proxy in California Current System (CCS) bamboo corals (Ba/Ca), (2) understanding the relationship between intermediate water nutrients and primary productivity in the CCS, and (3) the relationship between CCS export production and rapid climate change in the past (e.g. the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Niï¿½o Southern Oscillation).

Although others have noted that a key feature of economic and social impacts on the environment is unevenness in the creation of and exposure to impacts, few have sought to evaluate the socially-structured factors that create and support such disproportionality. Towards this end, this prjoect focuses on three research questions: 1) How has disproportionality in the production of pollution changed over time? 2) What drives changes over time in disproportionality in the production of pollution? 3) What factors account for the persistence of egregious polluters? This project will answer these questions by using both quantitative and qualitative comparative techniques that analyze facility-level emissions for over 600 establishments in the pulp and paper milling, printed circuit board manufacturing, and PVC pipe manufacturing industries in the U.S. This inquiry offers a new framework within which to analyze the production of environmental harm, challenging several common assumptions; namely the notion that environmental harm is proportional to economic growth and that firms are disconnected decision-making units. In addition to theoretical and empirical insights, a disproportionality approach also has direct implications for the regulation of pollution. Rather than setting absolute standards for an entire industry, a disproportionality approach focuses on identifying egregious polluters and enabling the reconfiguration of production among those who are the worst actors. Improving the environmental performance of a select few egregious polluters can significantly reduce the pollution burden generated by an industry.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The focus of this project is on facility pollution production metrics and socially-structured drivers of change over time. The analyses will rely on US EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data from 1988 to 2012 for three industry classifications: printed circuit board manufacturing (NAICS 334412), PVC pipe manufacturing (NAICS 326122), and pulp and paper milling (NAICS 3221). To answer the first research question (assessing the temporal dimensions of disproportionality), TRI data will be used to calculate several annual measures of disproportionality (Gini coefficients, lower-tail inequality ratios, relative ranking scoring, and spatial techniques) within each case study industry, using both raw and size adjusted facility-level data. To answer the second question (an assessment of the drivers of temporal changes in disproportionality in industrial pollution), analytical techniques such as regression and/or Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) will be used to to evaluate eight hypotheses, related to industry visibility, capital costs, contribution to GDP, offshoring, growth and decline, regulation, and niche-seeking behavior. The dependent variable in this will be annual measures of disproportionality by industry and/or ranks of individual facilities within the disproportionality distribution, yielding a total of seventy-five observations of disproportionality over the twenty-five year study period. To answer the third research question (assessing the persistence of disproportionate patterns), two most polluting facilities will be selected, based on multi-year average, size-adjusted TRI data, from each case study industry. The research team will then develop profiles of these six facilities, collecting data on operational characteristics, financial performance, characteristics of the communities in which they are located, interactions with regulators and the history of the facility within the community. Data will be gathered both through archival sources and through on-site interviews with facility managers, representatives of local government, and community organizations. Interviews will focus on the relationship between the facility and the local community. The goal of these facility profiles is to analyze the socially-structured factors that allow for the persistence of egregious pollution.","crimson"

This dataset will allow the response of East African hydroclimate to different orbital configurations and insolation regimes to be examined over multiple precession and eccentricity cycles. The research represents the first application of triple oxygen isotopes for paleoclimate reconstruction from sedimentary carbonate. By combining triple oxygen isotopes, recently shown to be sensitive recorders of evaporative processes, with more traditional isotopic proxies, the researcher aims to isolate the influence of evaporation on water balance.<br/><br/>Carbonate triple oxygen isotopes are a highly promising but yet-to-be exploited tool for reconstructing past tropical hydroclimate. The proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge of triple oxygen isotope variability in lake carbonate archives and their utility as Precipitation-Evaporation (P-E) proxies. These results will provide a possible roadmap for integrating triple oxygen isotopes into investigations of past water balance in other arid regions where evaporation is an important control. The data-model comparison between the record generated in this project and isotope-equipped climate model simulations will provide critical insight into the dynamics driving East African hydroclimate variability, thus aiding the assessment of model performance and improvement of future water availability projections in drought-sensitive areas.<br/><br/>The project involves interdisciplinary research combining methods and approaches from the fields of isotope geochemistry, paleoclimatology, and climate dynamics.

The objective of this project is to perform Ab initio based multiscale modeling of thermal transport in femtosecond laser materials processing. The key challenge in the modeling is to establish a unified formulation that can correctly and effectively describe thermal transport in femtosecond laser materials processing without or with minimal empirical formulations. The Ab initio based multiscale approach can bridge the divide between the experiments and theories, and eliminate the needs of any assumption and empirical parameters. A quantum molecular dynamics (MD) simulation based on density function theory (DFT) will be carried out first to determine appropriate intermolecular potentials for classical MD simulation. A hybrid MD/semi-classical two-temperature multiscale model will be developed by combining classical MD simulation based on the intermolecular potentials obtained from quantum MD simulation together with the semi-classical energy equation for electrons. An inverse heat transfer modeling based on the semi-classical two-temperature model will be carried out to obtain the microscale transport properties, which are then used to develop the continuum model for materials removal. The stochastic modeling of femtosecond laser processing of metal under uncertainties of thermophysical and processing parameters will be carried out. Experiments on femtosecond laser processing of gold and copper by femtosecond laser pulses will be conducted in order to validate the Ab initial based multiscale and stochastic models developed under this project. <br/><br/>The Ab initio based multiscale and stochastic models will allow the users to select proper processing parameters to obtain the desired micro- and nanostructure; this will result in significant reduction of cost associated with the traditional trial-and-error approach and will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States on nanomanufacturing. The outcome of the research will be disseminated through publications in archival journals, presentations at national and international conferences, and student dissertations. The outreach activities will also help promoting the public awareness and recognition of science and engineering and promote the public image of scientists and engineers, which will play a very important role in education at all levels and will also have broader impacts on technology, economy, and society.","coral"

The project will focus on issues associated with the complex ways in which human responses to changing demographic, economic, and environmental conditions lead to local-level decisions that can have significant impacts on the ways in which urban areas and the resource systems on which they depend function. The project will help develop new theoretical insights into what incentivizes human behavior regarding natural resource use under rapidly changing economic, demographic, and environmental contexts, and it will enhance methodological capabilities to identify changes in ecosystems in locales that traditionally have not been subject to ongoing monitoring. The project also will improve capabilities to forecast patterns of resource supply and demand related to changing socioeconomic and environmental conditions. The project has the potential to benefit society by informing policies that aim to combat environmental degradation and facilitate sustainable urban growth.

This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.<br/><br/>Recent scientific research has identified poverty, environmental degradation, and extreme weather as key drivers of urbanization in Africa and in many other parts of the developing world. Although only 30 percent of the African population lived in urban centers in 2000, this percentage is projected to double by 2050, with the majority of growth occurring in small- to medium-sized cities. Given the heavy reliance on charcoal as an energy source in African cities, rapid urbanization likely will increase forest degradation. This project will investigate interactions among urban and rural livelihoods and the health of the Miombo woodland ecosystems. Miombo woodlands are the most extensive forested ecosystem in Africa, covering 2.7-million square-km throughout eight southern African countries. The researchers will investigate how local-level decisions regarding charcoal production and consumption in changing economic and environmental contexts influence rates of forest degradation in Mozambique's Miombo woodlands. They will examine the charcoal trade in Tete, a mid-sized but rapidly growing city, to analyze how simultaneous economic and environmental change impact the well-being of people and the landscapes in which they live. They will integrate socioeconomic analysis and ecosystem modeling to better understand forest degradation in poorer regions that are rapidly integrating into the global economy. The results of the socioeconomic analyses will enable the refinement of an ecosystem model that accounts for consumer and producer preferences in charcoal production systems and their impact on forest degradation rates. The model will be used to simulate charcoal-driven forest degradation under various social, economic, and environmental scenarios in order to identify patterns that could compromise the sustainable use of Miombo woodlands and the well-being of urban and rural residents. Although focusing on a specific case study in Mozambique, many facets of the analysis will be of value in understanding coupled natural and human system dynamics in other nations and ecosystems.","maroon"

More recently the techniques have been applied to arts, social, political and other fields less traditionally reliant on high performance computing. This innovation has grown out of realization some 20 years ago that I/O (input/output) support for high performance parallel and distributed architectures had lagged behind that of pure computational speed, and further that bring I/O up to speed was both critical, and a rather difficult problem. The core hurdle of contemporary I/O on large HPC machines relates to issues of latency in large parts caused by the deficiencies of the historical I/O model that was relevant when computers were exclusively large, centralized, single processor systems shared by many time-sharing programs. In order to improve I/O on scalability on future hardware architectures novel approaches are required.<br/><br/>This project is conducting research on an extension of ParalleX, a new highly innovative parallel execution model. The extension provides a powerful I/O interface that allows researchers to create highly efficient data management, discovery, and analysis codes for Big Data applications. This new extension, known as PXFS, is based on HPX, an implementation of ParalleX based on C++, and OrangeFS, a high performance parallel file system. The research goal driving PXFS is to extend HPX objects into I/O space so that the objects become persistent and storage becomes another class of memory, all accessed as a single virtual address space and managed by an event driven dynamic adaptive computation environment. Critical aspects of this approach include futures-based synchronization, dynamic locality management, dynamic resource management, hierarchical name space, and an active global address space (AGAS). The overall goals of PXFS are to eliminate the division of programming imposed by conventional file system through the unification of name spaces and their management, and to minimize global synchronization in order to support asynchronous concurrency. The research methodology is to implement a Map/Reduce application framework using PXFS and evaluate its effectiveness in both performance and ease of use.<br/><br/>This project is conducted at three major research universities involving undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, and high-school teachers and their students. The project includes a PI from the functional genomics field acting as domain science expert in order to focus the development efforts on real world problems. Graduate students and post-docs involved in the project are trained in these areas to promote scientists who understanding both aspects of Big Data problems.

People also have to feel that they are accepted as belonging. Religious and other minority populations may be economically successful and yet find themselves excluded from full social participation. Furthermore, as the world becomes more interconnected, external pressure groups can affect the effective citizenship status accorded minorities or, alternatively, minorities may have external ties as important to them as their internal ones. Such developments challenge the very ideas of nation and citizen, both for social theoreticians who study them and for governments that serve them. In this research project, Northwestern University doctoral student Sadaf Hasnain, with the guidance of Dr. Robert Launay, will investigate this phenomenon through the lens of youth socialization. How do young people understand their belonging to a nation-state when they face ambiguous citizenship status? <br/><br/>The research will be conducted in Pakistan and will focus on the citizenship of young adherents of the Ahmadiyya faith, a 19th. century off-shoot of Islam. The economically successful Ahmadi regard themselves as Muslims but are not so regarded in Pakistani law. Their ambiguous status makes them ideal for this research. The investigator will carry out participant observation, group and individual interviews, content analysis of relevant news media, and archival research. These data will be used to assess the relationship between Ahmadi youth's sense of citizenship and belonging, the opposition to their religious identity and practice, and their social class and transnational religious ties. Findings from this research will provide insight into the relationship between legislation, exclusion, socio-economic status, and transnational links on the one hand and the construction of nation and citizenship on the other.

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) offer one strategy that is increasingly adopted in the housing policy realm. This project will address the question of how the geographical scale of a Community Land Trust affects its relationships in regional land and housing governance including interactions with other non-profit and government agencies, and its geographical identity. CLTs are private, not-for-profit organizations that own residential land in trust for a community, and are defined by membership and geographical boundaries at varying scales, from the sub-neighborhood to the urban region. CLTs offer long-term renewable leases for the use of their land to members, who in turn own the homes built on that land. A grassroots approach, CLTs initially developed in particular urban neighborhoods, but they are increasingly expanding their territories to cover large geographical areas, such as an entire city or county. Since CLTs are a potential and growing vehicle for supporting community-led redevelopment, their successes and failures have public policy implications. The project will offer insights about how CLTs relate to various levels of government as well as to their members, in geographically dispersed land trusts. Consequently, it will enhance understandings of urban development, community identity, and land regulation. The researchers will develop local and national advisory committees drawn from policy makers in CLTs and relevant government and non-profit institutions in order to drawn upon insights from, and disseminate research findings to, individuals and organizations working within and with housing-oriented community land trusts. <br/><br/>The project examines the importance of law and public policy in shaping land governance and the impacts on residents' perceptions of place and community. Through a combination of archival research, semi-structured interviews and roving interviews, the researchers will explore how community land trusts are structured legally, socially, and geographically. They examine the relationships of CLTs with members and non-members within the CLTs' territories as well as their relationships with local, regional, and federal governments. A case study of five CLTs within the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area allows for examination of the different ways that geography affects community identity and land use governance in CLTs, because the five CLTs vary in territorial extent. This comparison of neighborhood- and regional-scale impacts highlights the different ways that local and regional state institutions can engage with the project of CLT development with differential effects.","maroon"

Given the possibility for future water scarcity and increases in the size of storms, effectively integrating stormwater into current water management schemes will be crucial for both human and ecological health. To better understand the governance arrangements of this emerging type of integrated water resource management, the doctoral student will empirically examine attitudes about stormwater as well as how converging and diverging attitudes of it influence how it is managed in Chicago and Los Angeles. This project will integrate scholarship in science and technology studies and political ecology in order to advance knowledge regarding how attitudes, beliefs, and understandings shape urban environmental governance and water resource management. It also will enhance basic understanding of the impacts of technological innovation on urban environmental governance. By characterizing expert attitudes toward stormwater in cities with different political, technological, and climatic regimes this research will provide water managers and municipal agencies with new information and insights regarding different ways to deal with stormwater as they contemplate the implementation of new management policies. By including key stakeholders in multiple phases of the research design, the findings have the potential to directly influence decision-making processes and public policy. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The project will focus on three sets of core questions: (1) What is the history of stormwater management and regulation, and in what ways have the flows of stormwater been remade and redefined by political actors, scientific experts, and ordinary citizens? (2) What are the competing technological systems, social perspectives, and institutional arrangements that currently define stormwater, shape its management, and inscribe its uses and value? (3) How do these competing technologies, perspectives, and institutional arrangements relate to one another and influence how stormwater is understood, managed, and controlled in order to address issues of risk and vulnerability? To identify the shared attitudes and perspectives driving transitions in stormwater management, the student will use a comparative extreme?case study approach. He will use the Q-method of analysis in tandem with key informant interviews, analysis of archival data, and participant observation to identify different points of view and relate them to the points of view of others. The analyses will provide a better understanding of the perspectives driving transformations in stormwater management in different geographical contexts, and project findings will provide generalizable insights into the range of variation that occurs across a spectrum of water-stressed to water-abundant sites.","maroon"

One of the richest archives of the biotic and environmental changes on land for this period is on the Colorado Plateau, which despite over 100 years of study still remains poorly calibrated in time and poorly registered to the rest of the global record. To provide this desiderata, we will drill a continuous a ~500 m core through nearly the entire Triassic age section (Chinle and Moenkopi formations) at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP), Arizona, USA, one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth. A continuous sampling (core) is needed to place this spectacular record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, which has proved impractical in outcrop. The Petrified Forest core will provide a quantitatively sound reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition and will provide pristine unweathered samples. With such a reference section in hand the entire voluminous assemblage of outcrop data from the PFNP and the surrounding region can be integrated into the global framework. The hole will be deviated 30ï¿½ from vertical to provide core-bedding orientation intersections for an azimuthal guide; additionally, the orientation of the core will be registered to the hole wall using whole-core-scans and compass-oriented acoustic and optical televiewer images and dipmeter surveys. Core orientation will facilitate the recovery of a high-resolution magnetic polarity stratigraphy for correlation to the fossil-rich outcrop sections. The polarity sequence will be calibrated by a series of high-precision U-Pb zircon dates obtained from discrete levels in the core, and will provide critical data to fill the geochronologic gap in global terrestrial and marine time scales for the Late Triassic. The age-calibrated chronostratigraphy of the PFNP core will be used to address major issues of early Mesozoic biotic and environmental change. These include whether marine and continental biotic turnover events in the Late Triassic were coupled; was the largest magnitude faunal turnover event on land during the Late Triassic synchronous with the giant Manicouagan impact; Is the NSF-funded Newark basin astronomically-calibrated time scale consistent with high precision U-Pb zircon age data from the Chinle Formation; and was the cyclical climate change recorded in the Newark basin lacustrine record paced by Milankovitch climate change? <br/> In addition to the science generated by the core and its integration into the local and global environmental and biotic framework, the project will have a major education and outreach component. The Petrified Forest National Park is a major tourist destination, averaging 600,000 visitors a year. We plan to leverage this huge resource by developing a permanent exhibit on the coring project and its important scientific results for the park. We will involve numerous student groups during the actual coring activities, including Native American geoscience concentrators at The University of New Mexico/Gallup and K-12 students from throughout the Gallup area. In addition, we will sponsor several workshops at the Park and will reach out to the general public for their participation. The project involves six co-PIs from different institutions and will last 24 months and is intended to provide an initial synopsis of basic stratigraphic, logging, magnetic polarity, and geochronologic data for utilization by the international scientific community for further research and integration with other studies, as well as a major platform for outreach, and a better understanding of how the modern world came to be.","hot_pink"

As such, geometric diversity and interoperability often determine complexity, adaptability, trustworthiness, and resilience of the whole manufacturing enterprise. Owing to the diversity of manufacturing tasks, geometric representations have evolved into a multiplicity of abstract models, data structures, and formats that are suitable and optimized for specific tasks. Interoperability between such representations and systems emerged as a central challenge in the design of manufacturing information systems that is costing the US industry and economy billions while impeding major technological trends. This research project aims to make broad advances in theory and practice of geometric interoperability. Furthermore, this research will provide theoretical foundations and algorithmic infrastructure for supporting major technological trends, including web-enabled and cloud-supported manufacturing, democratization of manufacturing, and long term preservation and archival of engineering data. <br/><br/>The main goal of this research project is to extend and unify a formal semantics of extended geometric representations in support of advanced manufacturing systems and applications. This semantics will be used to formulate a rigorous algorithmic approach to interoperability in terms of a hierarchy of computable queries, superseding and leapfrogging earlier limited data-centric standardization efforts, and supporting diverse architectures for coming generations of information system. Specifically, this project will show the challenges of geometric interoperability may be overcome by (1) formulating sound rigorous foundations for geometric interoperability, (2) developing provable queries and algorithms based on the developed theory; and (3) demonstrating the power and effectiveness of the proposed approach to geometric interoperability","navy_blue"

How do hosts and parasites evolve in response to these new interactions, and what are the consequences for ecological dynamics of native and invasive hosts? This project uses interactions among a native bacterial parasite, a native zooplankton host, and an invasive zooplankton host that is now infected by the native bacterial parasite to ask how parasites adapt when they first enter a novel host. Existing genetic archives for both host and parasite provide a rare opportunity to study the important process of how pathogens that originate in one host species move to another; this host switch is very difficult to observe in nature. In addition, observational studies of lake populations, laboratory experiments and mathematical models will be used to understand how parasitism influences population dynamics of native and invasive hosts. <br/><br/>An important component of this project involves educating, training and diversifying the next generation of scientists. The principal investigator will work with science educators to develop hands-on, experiential learning activities for inner city children in Atlanta, focusing on plankton and microbes. Informal science education activities aimed at the general public will also be developed, and will be used to engage visitors to an inner city park. Pre-teacher undergraduates from Georgia Tech will be trained in scientific research, educational research, and pedagogy. In addition, students from Georgia Tech and nearby Spelman College will be involved in the proposed research, gaining valuable research experience. Finally, because many new human pathogens likely arose in different hosts, understanding the process by which pathogens jump from one host to another will have broad societal significance.","salmon"

The primary payload of each satellite is a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (developed at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory) which receives positioning signals from the GPS transmitter satellites as they rise and set relative to the COSMIC satellite. The GPS signals are refracted by the atmosphere as they travel from the transmitter to the receiver, to an extent which depends on the temperature and water vapor content of the lower atmosphere and the density of electric charge in the ionosphere. The refraction causes a delay in the phase of the transmitted signal which can be inverted to retrieve profiles of electron density (in the ionosphere), dry atmospheric temperature, and water vapor (although water vapor requires additional information). Because the profiles are retrieved from the rising and setting, or occultation, of the GPS transmitters, the technology is referred to as GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO), or more generally as GNSSRO, where GNSS is the Global Navigation Satellite System. GNSSRO has proven to be a highly effective observing method as the measurements can be made under all weather conditions, are unaffected by clouds and aerosols, and are absolutely calibrated (SI traceable) through the clock system that supports the GPS transmitters.<br/><br/>Funds under this award support COSMIC-related work in four categories: 1) processing, serving, and archiving COSMIC data for use by the research community; 2) conducting research to improve GNSSRO inversion science and techniques; 3) conducting research in support of scientific applications of GNSSRO data; and 4) education and outreach activities to promote the use of GNSSRO data and its application to atmospheric research. Item 1 is the bread-and-butter activity of this award and its predecessors, and support is also provided here for improving the quality of the profiles and generating additional data products such as monthly mean climatologies for both lower- and upper-atmospheric variables. In addition to the COSMIC satellites, a small number of GNSSRO ""missions of opportunity"" are also supported. These are research satellites to which a GNSS receiver has been added as a secondary payload (GRACE-B for example). Activities under item 2 continue the PIs' leadership role in the development of new GNSS processing techniques, for example by developing methods to correct errors caused by diffraction in sporadic E layers in the ionosphere. Research under item 3 develops new assimilation techniques such as the use of 2D ray-tracing methods to account for horizontal refractivity gradients. Another task is to develop long-term climate-quality datasets in which profiles from different satellites are optimally combined to account for differences in their error characteristics. GNSSRO data are well-suited for generating long-term multi-mission datasets given their SI traceability. Work under item 4 addresses a gap between the availability of GPSRO data and its adoption by the research community. Activities include hosting academic visitors, conducting meetings and workshops, and holding summer colloquia and tutorials.<br/><br/>The work has intellectual merit due to the great value of the COSMIC observations for weather, climate and ionospheric research. The work has scientific broader impacts through the PIs' education and outreach efforts to promote the adoption and use of the data by scientists from several research communities. In addition, the PIs provide the COSMIC data to operational weather forecasting centers worldwide, and the data has been shown to be quite useful for improving the skill of weather forecasts.<br/><br/>This award supercedes AGS-1033112, the previous cooperative agreement under which NSF provided funds to COSMIC. While NSF is no longer providing funds via the earlier CA, that award will remain active as it contains funds from other agencies to support the development of the follow-on COSMIC-2 mission. This award does not provide funds for COSMIC-2.","fuchsia"

But, if we do not understand the newly discovered data, with its inherent limitations and biases, it cannot be responsibly utilized for new or collaborative research efforts. Working with environmental sensor manufacturers and researchers, the X-DOMES project will develop tools and social and technical infrastructure to facilitate the creation of data about data (metadata). Metadata describes not only who, when and where the observations were made, but also it must document how an observation came to be (provenance). By taking this knowledge out of manuals and human-readable documents, the X-DOMES model creates metadata that can be treated like data ? discoverable and searchable, making it ready to be incorporated into automated archival and processing for quality assurance and validation methods. <br/><br/>Leveraging existing relationships with large NSF-funded data management programs, EarthCube building blocks and working groups, and environmental sensor manufacturers and consortia, we will establish a community of sensor manufacturers and other stakeholders to provide a unifying approach to describing sensors and observations across geo-science domains.

To systematically investigate the spatial-temporal pattern of past climate changes and to quantitatively characterize the prominent patterns that might be revealed requires a spatially distributed network of relevant paleoclimate time series. This project will link polar and non-polar regions and to develop paleoclimate data sets for testing model outcomes by assembling a major new database of existing paleoclimate records spanning from the Arctic to the tropics. <br/><br/>The scale of the region is sufficient to investigate the primary features of ocean-atmospheric circulation along the eastern margin of the North Pacific and to study the latitudinal response of climate to orbital changes, the strongest climate forcing of the Holocene.

Determining the extent to which finer-scale patterns might be discerned based on evidence from a wider variety of proxy types, including physical, chemical and biological evidence from both marine and terrestrial archives, requires a major effort to maximize the utility of previous studies. A large portion of relevant published data has not yet been assembled and requires collaboration with individual scientists to generate a comprehensive, expert-informed product. Once properly assembled and quality controlled, a machine-readable database of proxy climate time series can be readily analyzed to quantify the most prominent patterns.<br/><br/>The project offers the potential for providing a large data set of paleoclimate information available to the wider community for use in recognizing patterns of climate and addressing gaps in knowledge.

The doctoral student will explore how the law could potentially recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is incorporated into multiple legal spaces and systems. The project will broaden theoretical understandings of linkages among human systems, climate and environmental change, and spatial dimensions of the ocean and law in the greater Arctic region. The project will advance conceptualizations of sea ice in a way that recognizes that sea ice is not a stationary object, because it moves through time and space in response to the physical forces of wind, ocean currents, and heating. Furthermore, sea ice is neither terrestrial nor marine, just as it is neither purely solid nor liquid. Project findings will expand knowledge about the relationships between this dynamic physical element and the political powers that govern a complex ocean environment. The project will provide new insights regarding how the law can recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is attached to and integrated into multiple legal spaces and systems. These insights will be of value to those charged with overseeing activities in regions where sea ice occurs. Among those organizations is the multinational Arctic Council, which the United States chairs from 2015 to 2017. Project findings will help address two of the focus areas of the U.S. chairmanship (the impacts of changing climate and environmental conditions and Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship) by expanding knowledge about the role that changing spatial sea ice patterns have in the many political debates of this region. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Changes to the spatial extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean simultaneously permit and endanger maritime operations, and those changes impact current debates over maritime boundaries, presenting an interesting challenge for international law.

MIDFIELD is a resource enabling the study of students that includes longitudinal, whole population data for multiple institutions. Retention, measured in various ways, has been the dominant mode of studying student success in engineering education and in higher education in general. However, simply studying who matriculates and who graduates does not tell the complete story of a student's path through the engineering curriculum nor should it be used as a measure of an institution. A national, longitudinal student unit-record database would enable study of engineering programs and benchmark metrics consistently. MIDFIELD has already been proven to facilitate data on student matriculation habits disaggregated across various engineering disciplines, ethnicities and genders. However is value as a predictive tool has also been somewhat limited due to the small (eleven) number of institutions who have provided their student data.<br/><br/>This project will enable the expansion of the MIDFIELD database to include a total of 103 institutions. With input from university data managers, engineering education administrators, specialists in high volume data archiving and the community of researchers, this work will result in a database containing over 1.05 million students. More specifically the data will represent over 50% of the U.S. engineering undergraduate degrees awarded and increase the diversity of institutions in the dataset. MIDFIELD will now include public and private institutions, minority serving institutions, and institutions from a broad range of research classifications. The sheer scope and longitude of MIDFIELD will enable significant improvements in research in higher education. It will enable the development of research capacity to examine student characteristics (race/ethnicity/gender/social class) and curricular pathways (including coursework) by institution and over time. Furthermore, this project will utilize workshops as well as asynchronous training modules to educate the broader research community, expanding the network of researchers capable of conducting this research and the sharing of innovative research methods in addition to the actual data. Finally, because the dataset contains students records of all students matriculating over a period of time, researchers can study students across all disciplines, not solely engineering.<br/><br/>Due to the broad nature of the disciplines represented by MIDFIELD, this project has cross-Directorate support from the Directorates of Engineering, Math and Physical Sciences (MPS), and Education and Human Resources (EHR) as well as the Office of Integrative Activities (OIA). Within the MPS Directorate, this work is supported by Astronomy, and Physics; within EHR, this work is supported by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.","beige"

If the mechanisms can be better understood, then the uncertainties associated with making climate predictions on these timescales can be assessed more accurately. Decadal variability over the Pacific is of particular interest in the United States due to its downstream influence over the western United States and its direct influence on climate in Alaska. This project addresses the fundamental question of what are the predictability limits, mechanisms, and regional impacts for decadal modes of the Pacific climate system using a hierarchy of climate models and modern statistical tools. The results of this project will be important in assessing how long-term changes in the environment drive changes in economically important variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, snowfall, temperatures, as well as oceanic temperatures, currents and sea levels, which impacts fisheries, agriculture, and coastal infrastructure along the U.S. West Coast and Asian Marginal Seas. The tools developed in this project should be transferable to other global sectors that also exhibit decadal variability. The project team will mentor graduate students and post-docs, whose educational experiences will include cross-disciplinary exposure to ocean science, atmospheric science, and societal impacts that will be unique in this context. Community outreach will include lectures and educational presentations in public forums, mentoring K-12 students, educating grass-roots climate action organizations, informing the media, and posting research results on web pages.<br/><br/>There is clearly a large gap in our understanding of what controls Pacific decadal climate variability, what limits the predictability of the flows, and what practical skill might be useful in regional impacts on land and in the ocean. The project team proposes a coordinated research effort to better understand the basic physical dynamics of Pacific decadal variability and assess the skill of Pacific decadal predictability, along with its uncertainties and practical value. The research focuses on Community Earth System Model (CESM), with its vast repository of archived runs supplemented with targeted predictability experiments. The analysis focuses on using sophisticated statistical models (Linear Inverse Models) to identify statistical relations among variables, diagnose physical processes, and isolate potentially predictable components of the flows. It also involves using regional coupled atmosphere-ocean, along with uncoupled ocean and atmosphere models, to enhance the understanding of regional response and its potential for practical use in forecasting. The project brings together scientists skilled with developing decadal climate diagnostics, making both statistical and dynamical predictions, and executing regional coupled climate downscaling and regional high-resolution ocean modeling.","lavender"

This project will exploit long-term ecological data to ask when, where, and how often changes observed in aquatic organisms represent true evolutionary responses. Its value lies in the use and analysis of existing data to ask new questions about the nature of ecological changes over time. The University of Texas at Arlington is an Hispanic Serving Institution; groups under-served in STEM areas comprise 42% of the student population. The investigator will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the research activities, with clear plans to recruit students from under-served groups. He will use his analyses and resulting data in undergraduate inquiry-based laboratory exercises to demonstrate how to distinguish ecological from evolutionary responses and to extend his mentoring of under-served groups. Existing outreach programs at his institution will allow him to engage high school students in summer research activities. Through public outreach programs, he will increase awareness of the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to anthropogenic change and the importance of long-term research.<br/><br/>Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites have documented responses of natural populations and communities to rising temperatures, increased urbanization, eutrophication, and the spread of exotic species, but have not examined the extent to which these responses reflect evolutionary change. The five aims comprising this project will quantify phenotypic responses to long-term ecological change, using phenotype as a signal for evolutionary responses. Existing data, samples, and experiments from over twenty lakes in Wisconsin and Alaska will be analyzed to explore changes in zooplankton traits that might indicate evolutionary responses to invasive species, land use change, rising temperatures, and changes in nutrient availability. Appropriate data sets and samples to address these questions have been identified, although some questions will require new measurements from archived specimens. Preliminary analyses are provocative. In some cases, changes in zooplankton body sizes and abundances support predator-induced selection. In other cases, they contradict predictions from prevailing theory. Exploratory statistical analyses will be used throughout to relate changes in response variables to putative selection pressures.

This proposal will use existing long-term population data collected at Long Term Ecological Research sites to test this perception rigorously. Results could overturn this long-standing assumption and provide fundamental new insights to the field of population ecology. Data synthesized by this project will be available through a global population dynamics database that is used worldwide. A clearer understanding of how environmental variability affects population dynamics will improve conservation and management efforts. Evidence for positive effects of environmental variability will alter strategies to conserve threatened species or to manage invasive species. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher and a data analyst, and will provide training opportunities at the interface of modeling, statistical analyses, and data synthesis for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This project will attempt the first large-scale synthesis of demographic data to assess the effects of environmental variability on population dynamics. Twenty-five Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) projects have been collecting population-level data for decades, yet these data are rarely used to address key questions in population ecology. The investigator will collect all LTER time series of abundances or vital rates by manually inspecting each of the > 6,000 data sets available from the LTER data portal, by combing data archives, and by contacting LTER researchers directly. The data will be analyzed to test the magnitude and direction of skewness in the distribution of log(population growth rate) as an indicator of non-linear responses to environmental variation. When spatially-replicated time series are available, they will be used to separate process error from sampling error and analyzed with hierarchical models. Once skewness in distributions of population growth rates is quantified, the investigator will attempt to identify key environmental drivers. This is the riskiest part of the project; when possible, these will allow the researcher to quantify demographic response functions and predict the effects of variability on population dynamics with greater confidence. Evidence that effects of environmental variability are commonly neutral or positive will fundamentally alter understanding of population dynamics in stochastic environments.","salmon"

Community Land Trusts (CLTs) offer one strategy that is increasingly adopted in the housing policy realm. This project will address the question of how the geographical scale of a Community Land Trust affects its relationships in regional land and housing governance including interactions with other non-profit and government agencies, and its geographical identity. CLTs are private, not-for-profit organizations that own residential land in trust for a community, and are defined by membership and geographical boundaries at varying scales, from the sub-neighborhood to the urban region. CLTs offer long-term renewable leases for the use of their land to members, who in turn own the homes built on that land. A grassroots approach, CLTs initially developed in particular urban neighborhoods, but they are increasingly expanding their territories to cover large geographical areas, such as an entire city or county. Since CLTs are a potential and growing vehicle for supporting community-led redevelopment, their successes and failures have public policy implications. The project will offer insights about how CLTs relate to various levels of government as well as to their members, in geographically dispersed land trusts. Consequently, it will enhance understandings of urban development, community identity, and land regulation. The researchers will develop local and national advisory committees drawn from policy makers in CLTs and relevant government and non-profit institutions in order to drawn upon insights from, and disseminate research findings to, individuals and organizations working within and with housing-oriented community land trusts.<br/><br/>The project examines the importance of law and public policy in shaping land governance and the impacts on residents' perceptions of place and community. Through a combination of archival research, semi-structured interviews and roving interviews, the researchers will explore how community land trusts are structured legally, socially, and geographically. They examine the relationships of CLTs with members and non-members within the CLTs' territories as well as their relationships with local, regional, and federal governments. A case study of five CLTs within the Minneapolis - St. Paul metropolitan area allows for examination of the different ways that geography affects community identity and land use governance in CLTs, because the five CLTs vary in territorial extent. This comparison of neighborhood- and regional-scale impacts highlights the different ways that local and regional state institutions can engage with the project of CLT development with differential effects.","maroon"

There has been a proliferation of calls for systems engineering, including the Secretary of Defense and the National Academies. Simultaneously over the past 25 years, elements of a theory of systems engineering have emerged. These elements point to an opportunity to formulate systems engineering as a rigorous engineering discipline. The elements span mathematics, economics, business, and psychology, as well as significant elements of engineering and the sciences. Numerous Universities and professional societies offer diverse educational programs and certifications in systems engineering. This workshop on systems engineering education will assist in the unification of these disparate perspectives and help the systems engineering community move forward via improving the overall systems engineering education function.<br/><br/>A survey of systems engineering related programs identified a diversity of systems engineering educations programs, without a consensus on how to create better systems engineering processes and the associated underlying educational foundations. The primary purpose of the workshop is to investigate the future of systems engineering education and not conduct a review of the history nor the current state of systems engineering education, but a look forward. The workshop will bring the leaders of the systems engineering community in the US together to investigate the following issues: 1) the needs of government and industry in terms of the tasks and roles that belong to systems engineering, 2) the elements of the skill and knowledge sets required to meet the systems engineering needs, 3) the organization of these elements into coherent systems engineering curricula at all levels, 4) the underlying theories that provide the needed skill and knowledge sets and that will form the basis of systems engineering education, and 5) the knowledge gaps that need to be researched that would enhance systems engineering education.

The research explores how the structure of local government networks affects the efficacy of policy entrepreneurs (sometimes known as ""leaders"" or ""issue advocates"") in convincing local officials in California and New York to adopt HVHF policies. The project also evaluates how the social networks of policy entrepreneurs affect the innovativeness of local HVHF policies. Finally, it analyzes the social mechanisms driving decision-makers? (non)participation in the diffusion of HVHF policies among sub-state jurisdictions. This research advances scholarship by drawing insights from network science that allow quantitative analysis of how human agents' policy entrepreneurs and local government officials' engage with social networks and influence policy diffusion. In addition to its scientific contributions, this research and associated outreach will help local government officials learn how to leverage their information networks most effectively when seeking information about HVHF or other issues of salience to local governance. Such learning is particularly important given the sharp capacity constraints these officials often face. Another important output of this project is an online decision-support tool that will help local officials learn about HVHF policy options. This free, searchable web interface will house hundreds of digitized, archived, and categorized pro- and anti-HVHF policy measures passed by sub-state jurisdictions in California and New York. <br/><br/>This project uses social network analysis to illuminate blind spots in policy scholarship. Policy diffusion is clearly a network-reliant process, yet policy scholars all but ignore how learning, imitative, or competitive inter-jurisdictional pressures experienced by local officials may shape diffusion patterns. They also rarely examine the content of policies subject to diffusion. Research on policy entrepreneurs, individuals who push a policy onto the public agenda and help secure its passage, acknowledges the importance of networks in facilitating entrepreneurial advocacy yet devotes little attention to the mechanisms that drive this influence. Scholars who do tackle these questions rarely use quantitative methods. The project addresses these gaps. It quantitatively tests hypotheses about how aspects of policy entrepreneurs? social networks affect their success in convincing decision makers to adopt policy innovations, how ties among municipal decision makers can reveal the social mechanisms underlying policy diffusion, and how policy entrepreneurship can shape the innovativeness of policies and their rate of uptake.","crimson"

(AUI) will manage the operation of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) from October 1, 2009 to September 30, 2015, maintaining the strong reputation of NRAO as the premier radio astronomy observatory in the world. The research community will be provided cutting-edge<br/>capabilities: the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the most precise filled-aperture, fully steerable radio telescope; the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), replacing the Very Large Array, already the most productive radio telescope ever built; the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), with micro-arcsecond<br/>astrometry, the highest resolution imaging telescope at any wavelength; and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), with unprecedented millimeter-wavelength sensitivity and resolution. All will operate with state-of-the art instrumentation, advanced data processing, and broad user<br/>support, enabling the entire astronomy community to address key problems in astronomy and astrophysics.<br/><br/>INTELLECTUAL MERIT: The opportunities for astronomy and astrophysics research have never been richer. The unique NRAO radio telescopes will complement the next generation of large ground based optical telescopes and space-based facilities covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Together they<br/>comprise a comprehensive suite of powerful tools to probe and decipher the full range of outstanding problems, from the origin of planets, stars, quasars and galaxies, to the structure of the Universe and the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Observations with VLBA, EVLA and ALMA will shed new light on<br/>exoplanets, and planetary and stellar formation and evolution. EVLA and ALMA will image the gas and dust of the first galaxies near the end of the epoch of reionization and normal galaxies beyond z~1. VLBA microarcsecond astrometry is making possible a new class of precision measurements of the parallax of premain sequence stars, recoil motions of stars in response to exoplanets, the structure of the Galaxy and the dynamics of the Local Group of galaxies. Accurate pulsar timing with the GBT is enabling high precision<br/>tests of General Relativity in the strong field limit and detection of the stochastic background of nanoHertz gravitational waves. Multi-epoch high resolution VLBA images will lead to a better understanding of relativistic jets from micro-quasars and supermassive black holes found in Active Galactic Nuclei, along with the nature of gamma-ray bursts seen by the GLAST satellite. GBT will discover new megamasers, and follow-up VLBA observations will provide the angular-diameter distance determination of galaxies in the Hubble flow, leading to a more accurate determination of the Hubble Constant, higher precision determination of cosmological constants, and better constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACT: NRAO facilities are used by more than one thousand scientists each year and are available to all scientists based on the intellectual merits of the proposed studies, independent of institutional or national affiliation. NRAO will provide end-to-end user support at its science centers, enabling easy<br/>access to its telescope and their data by the entire astronomical community. Calibrated images will be made available in archives accessible to both the broad research community and the public through the Virtual Astronomical Observatory. Astronomy is an important element in meeting national goals related to diversity, science and technology education, and increased U.S. competitiveness. NRAO is attracting an increasingly diverse staff. Through the undergraduate Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) and co-op programs, resident graduate fellowships and external student grants, Green Bank and Socorro summer schools, and competitive postdoctoral Jansky Fellowships, it continues to help train the next generation of scientists. The Green Bank Science Center, the VLA Visitors Center, US-Chile teacher/student exchange programs, and teacher and K-12 education programs, further serve to create a science-literate public.","lime"

Satellite remote-sensing, regional climate modeling and nonlinear analysis techniques will be used to: assess variability of observed surface melt occurrence; benchmark model-based melt proxies versus observed melt; diagnose synoptic-scale meteorological/sea-ice controls on melt; and assess future change in melt proxies based on regional models driven by CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) general circulation models (GCMs). Understanding surface melt on polar ice sheets is important because surface melt affects albedo, can produce useful paleoclimatic records, contributes to mass balance through runoff, and is a trigger for ice-shelf collapse leading to ice-flow acceleration and sea-level rise. Improved understanding of the synoptic-meteorological causes of melting, and of the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate melting accurately, would help assess the effects of future warming on melting, ice-sheet flow and sea level rise. The investigators propose three main research themes to help address these issues: (1) regional-atmospheric-model skill assessments and diagnosis of present synoptic controls on surface melt; (2) application of results from the model skill assessments to GCM-based climate scenarios for estimates of future change; and (3) expanding satellite-based retrieval of surface melt state characterization through retrieval of melt magnitude using a novel fusion of passive microwave and optical/thermal satellite data. In addition to addressing key questions relating Greenland ice sheet balance to sea-level change, the project includes outreach to the public, primarily through a web site, and numerous educational impacts. The project would support undergraduate and graduate students, and involves investigators from a primarily undergraduate institution with a significant population of first-generation college students, and from a Hispanic-serving institution. All data and model results will be archived and made available through the ACADIS data center.","plum"

Most small discharges occur proximally to a volcanic vent concurrent or within a few minutes of an explosive volcanic eruption. Large scale discharges typically occur throughout a mature plume formed 5 or more minutes subsequent to an explosive eruption. This research work focuses on studying the small, proximal discharges that occur concurrent with explosive volcanic eruptions. The main goal is to better characterize the proximal electrical activity within the context of the eruptive activity to gain a better understanding of the eruptive conditions that are required to produce different types of small-scale discharges. This characterization will be accomplished by making high-resolution 3-D lightning mapping observations of lighting discharges during small explosive eruptions of Sakurajima Volcano located in the Kyushu region of southwestern Japan. Other instrumentation (infrasound, video cameras, and electric field change sensors) will be used to monitor the explosive activity, plume development, and changes in electric field caused by lightning. The data will be used to determine when different types of electrical discharges occur relative to the onset of an explosive eruption and in relation to the ascent of volcanic ejecta. Electrical discharges will be characterized by determining the length scales, speeds, and polarities of the discharges, as well as by locating where the discharges initiate.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>The research would be the most detailed study of volcanic lightning to date, combining measurements of volcano infrasound, electric field changes, and plume development with high-resolution Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data and high-speed video observations of volcanic lighting. The inclusion of electric field change measurements, high-speed video, and visual plume observations distinguishes this project from previous research. The research will increase knowledge of electrical activity that occurs as a direct result of an explosive volcanic eruption. This will contribute to our understanding of the eruption processes that are responsible for producing electrical activity proximally to a volcanic vent.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Because small-scale discharges frequently accompany volcanic eruptions of a large range of sizes, the results of the research will be applicable to developing an eruption monitoring system that utilizes VHF observations of lightning and electrical activity. In addition, the results of the research will be used to determine if one can predict eruption magnitudes or ash plume heights based on observations of electrical activity. The research will also provide training for an early career researcher from an underrepresented group and three graduate students.

However, raising and defending a large family can increase stress on parents. Additionally, hormones often regulate expression of behaviors. For example, testosterone is associated with reduced parental care and increased aggression in many birds. High levels of testosterone have been linked to reduced survival in birds, but the mechanisms underlying this link are unknown. One hypothesis is that testosterone shortens telomeres. Telomeres are short sequences of DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes and can affect survival. Stress can also shorten telomere lengths, and shorter telomeres have been associated with reduced lifespan. The researchers have manipulated brood sizes of eastern bluebirds to alter parental care, aggression, and stress, which can all interact with testosterone levels. They will determine how family size, behavior, and hormones affect telomere lengths to impact longevity and survival. The researchers will also develop education programs for local high school students to learn fundamental concepts in the fields of behavioral ecology and physiology.<br/><br/>The researchers have found that bluebirds have considerable individual variation in testosterone production. Testosterone is implicated in important, fitness-related behaviors. The costs of elevating testosterone are also well-documented. Although much has been done to elucidate relationships between behaviors and the hormonal mechanisms that regulate them, there is currently very little information about how behavioral and physiological links might be tied to mechanisms that affect survival (i.e., telomere lengths and telomere loss). The researchers will analyze previously collected blood samples to measure testosterone, corticosterone, and telomere lengths. They will relate these physiological measurements to previously recorded behavioral data. By linking costly behaviors mediated by testosterone to telomere lengths, this study will take an integrative approach to answering questions that span the fields of behavioral ecology, endocrinology, and evolution. Data will archived at Oklahoma State University and requests for data will be fulfilled upon approval of the researchers.","teal"

Genomics has qualitatively improved our ability to investigate biological dynamics and to make important discoveries that are the foundations for understanding topics such as environmental change, developing and protecting crops, and improving health outcomes. Genome analysis, however, is a significant challenge for the practicing biologist. Most biologists who need to undertake genome science are not sufficiently expert in the relevant analytical tools, or understand the complex workflows required to get from the initial data generated by sequencers to a biologically meaningful analyzed result. In addition, few have access to the supercomputing resources and large-scale storage required for processing and managing genomics data. The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) addresses these challenges by providing an integrated service comprised of expert consulting and educational services, hardened and optimized software available through easy to use web-based workflow management tools, large memory supercomputers, and large scale data storage and publishing facilities. These resources are particularly useful for researchers from smaller, and minority serving, institutions that typically do not have access to the required expertise and cyberinfrastructure, yet whose investigations are equally important. Since its inception in 2011, the NCGAS has supported over 80 research projects representing over $61M in funded research. It engaged in 51 training events that served 691 individuals, of which 241 were from traditionally underserved populations.<br/><br/>The NCGAS (http://ncgas.org) was established in 2011 through a National Science Foundation ABI development award to help the national research community complete genomics research that requires data management and computational infrastructures at scale. NCGAS is a partnership among the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center. It meets the technology challenges of modern genome science by providing excellent bioinformatics consulting services for genome analysis, particularly genome and transcriptome assembly, including research design, data analysis and visualization. It optimizes, supports, and delivers genome analysis software on national supercomputing systems such as those funded by the NSF eXtreme Digital (XD) program and coordinated by the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and the Open Science Grid (OSG). The NCGAS maintains and supports easy-to-use gateways, including Galaxy web portals, for genome analysis workflows that lower barriers for scientist to create, execute, document, and share genomics analyses. It distributes software tools for genome analysis to research computing facilities and the general research community so that IT managers can more easily install these tools on their systems. It provides long-term archival storage services. The NCGAS provides a digital library resource for the dissemination of data sets, publications, reports, or collections of files that will allow research to be visible and data to be re-used for decades to come. It delivers education and outreach programs on genome analysis, interpretation, and data management to biology faculty and students nationally. These programs will enhance the technology literacy of practicing scientists and help grow the bioinformatics workforce. These services are particularly available to smaller institutions across the country without access to supercomputers, bioinformatics expertise, or training. The NCGAS will enable breakthroughs that would not be possible without advanced cyberinfrastructure support.","puce"

The research is set in the Temecula Valley of Southern California, which is an ideal area to explore these issues as it is being challenged with plans for land use that have potentially large impacts in terms of the economy, ecology, and social development of region. The project seeks to understand landscape transformation and the uses of natural resources, especially water, in this process, as well as the multiple labor processes upon which niche agricultural markets are built. This project employs a number of qualitative methods including participant observation fieldwork, key informant interviews, focus groups, the collection of oral histories, surveys, and archival data research. The research for this 3-year project will be conducted by the Principal Investigator and a team of advanced graduate students in applied anthropology.<br/><br/>Building on economic anthropological explorations into the conditions under which cooperation occurs among market competitors, this project's research design explores how many different stakeholders combine into a single system using the concept of terroir, a term that is used to explain how the land imparts a particular quality to a product. The researcher extends this concept to include other aspects of the land, including the effects on the environment, the interests of the residents and government, and the primary consumers of the products from this region. The methods have the potential to fundamentally transform anthropological and other social scientific approaches to the study of work, by creating a model that could be applied to other landscapes with complex social systems.<br/><br/>The project includes a student training component that will also contribute development of competitive science and technological education. The broader impacts of the proposed research also include providing information on environmental sustainability, tourism, conditions of agricultural employment, and the impacts of food chain processes.

The focus is on how the geographical sciences become entangled with politics, territorial claim making, and nation-state building in Israel and the Palestinian Territories since 1948 until today. Qualitative research methods such as in-depth interviewing, ethnography, and archival and library research will be used.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merits<br/>This project investigates: how geography, cartography and mapping practices have become entwined with the building of nation-states; how social, institutional, and political contexts shape map-making; how various actors, institutions, and governments use maps to shape territorial visions; and how maps relate to material structures (such as the West Bank Barrier). The project also aims to develop a systematic and comprehensive methodology to analyze how social and political concerns become embedded in the visual rhetoric of maps. <br/><br/>Potential Broader Impacts<br/>New mapping technologies and software greatly enable user-defined mapping practices. As a result, various social groups increasingly disseminate alternative mappings. In such an environment it is especially pertinent to focus scholarly attention on developing conceptual tools for understanding the rhetoric of mapping practices. The Israeli-Palestinian dispute over mapping provides a rich context for theorizing about alternative mapping practices so as to emphasize the importance of constructing integrative maps that recover diverse geopolitical visions. A careful analyses of how and why different adversarial groups map the same territory differently may serve as a resource for reconciliation; it will contribute to a better understanding of the historical and political genealogy of such diverging practices and provide insight into the social-ethnic histories of diverse populations in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, and in other suitably similar contexts.","crimson"

For example, changes in the D/H ratio of polar ice cores are arguably the best record of past glacial/interglacial cycles. But current understanding of their behavior in the biosphere is rather limited. It is known that plants preferentially take up H relative D, and so organic matter is strongly depleted in D relative to environmental water. However, it is not known how these isotopes behave in consumers, either animals or microbes, and how isotopic signals propagate through ecosystems. In turn, it is not well known how to interpret ancient records of organic matter D/H, of primary importance to the Earth Science community. Do ancient organic records only record the hydrologic cycle (i.e. climate), or do they also record changes in ecosystem? This proposal tackles that fundamental problem from the standpoint of microbial consumers: bacteria, archaea, and microscopic eukaryotes that live by eating organic materials. The proposed research seeks to answer the questions of how they alter D/H ratios in organic matter, and whether such changes are correlated with their type of metabolism. The problem will be addressed through the use of cultures under well-defined conditions and then directly measuring the D/H ratios of lipid molecules that would be representative of the sedimentary organic record. A number of supporting biochemical measurements will be used to help us understand the mechanistic basis for why such variations exist. The broader impacts consist of developing a web-accessible database for archiving and searching biologic D/H data, involving graduate and undergraduate students, and incorporating research results into an International Geobiology Course as well as standard journal publications and conference presentations. <br/><br/>Methods for measuring the D/H ratios of individual lipids have existed for more than a decade, yet almost all such efforts have been directed exclusively towards plants and phytoplankton, with the goal of paleoclimate reconstruction. Recent data suggest, however, that there is a much richer complexity of isotopic fractionations in the world around us, and that it could also be useful for other types of investigations. Variations in the ï¿½D values of heterotrophic microbial lipids of up to 500? have been observed, and these signals appear to be controlled by host metabolism, rather than the D/H ratio of growth substrates. If so, H isotopes in naturally occurring lipids could potentially be used to trace microbial metabolism, both in modern and ancient environments, an important scientific goal. The objective of this proposal is to begin to understand the scope and mechanistic basis of such variations in organisms other than plants, and to ultimately move the methodology toward being a useful tool for geobiology. To do this, the PI will undertake three related lines of research: i) The PI will undertake a broad, culture-based survey of microbial D/H fractionations, including bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes using a range of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms. The anticipates studying ~10-15 different organisms, each grown under a range of conditions and on different substrates. ii) To obtain a deeper mechanistic understanding of such fractionations, the PI will employ more targeted biochemical studies using abundance measurements of NAD(P)H and transhydrogenase enzyme activity to understand key biochemical processes affecting the isotopic composition of cellular reducing equivalents. iii) The PI will develop compound-specific measurements for amino acids, which will allow us to examine a class of compounds more representative of bulk biomass, as well as specific proteins that are more diagnostic for biotic sources.","hot_pink"

One of the richest archives of the biotic and environmental changes on land for this period is on the Colorado Plateau, which despite over 100 years of study still remains poorly calibrated in time and poorly registered to the rest of the global record. To provide this desiderata, we will drill a continuous a ~500 m core through nearly the entire Triassic age section (Chinle and Moenkopi formations) at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP), Arizona, USA, one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth. A continuous sampling (core) is needed to place this spectacular record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, which has proved impractical in outcrop. The Petrified Forest core will provide a quantitatively sound reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition and will provide pristine unweathered samples. With such a reference section in hand the entire voluminous assemblage of outcrop data from the PFNP and the surrounding region can be integrated into the global framework. The hole will be deviated 30ï¿½ from vertical to provide core-bedding orientation intersections for an azimuthal guide; additionally, the orientation of the core will be registered to the hole wall using whole-core-scans and compass-oriented acoustic and optical televiewer images and dipmeter surveys. Core orientation will facilitate the recovery of a high-resolution magnetic polarity stratigraphy for correlation to the fossil-rich outcrop sections. The polarity sequence will be calibrated by a series of high-precision U-Pb zircon dates obtained from discrete levels in the core, and will provide critical data to fill the geochronologic gap in global terrestrial and marine time scales for the Late Triassic. The age-calibrated chronostratigraphy of the PFNP core will be used to address major issues of early Mesozoic biotic and environmental change. These include whether marine and continental biotic turnover events in the Late Triassic were coupled; was the largest magnitude faunal turnover event on land during the Late Triassic synchronous with the giant Manicouagan impact; Is the NSF-funded Newark basin astronomically-calibrated time scale consistent with high precision U-Pb zircon age data from the Chinle Formation; and was the cyclical climate change recorded in the Newark basin lacustrine record paced by Milankovitch climate change? <br/> In addition to the science generated by the core and its integration into the local and global environmental and biotic framework, the project will have a major education and outreach component. The Petrified Forest National Park is a major tourist destination, averaging 600,000 visitors a year. We plan to leverage this huge resource by developing a permanent exhibit on the coring project and its important scientific results for the park. We will involve numerous student groups during the actual coring activities, including Native American geoscience concentrators at The University of New Mexico/Gallup and K-12 students from throughout the Gallup area. In addition, we will sponsor several workshops at the Park and will reach out to the general public for their participation. The project involves six co-PIs from different institutions and will last 24 months and is intended to provide an initial synopsis of basic stratigraphic, logging, magnetic polarity, and geochronologic data for utilization by the international scientific community for further research and integration with other studies, as well as a major platform for outreach, and a better understanding of how the modern world came to be.","hot_pink"

These considerations provide motivation to the proposed workshop entitled ""Can Technology Make a Difference in Pediatric Rehabilitation""? This rhetorical question emphasizes the need for fostering research at the intersection of engineering, computer science, and rehabilitation with focus on pediatric interventions. The proposed workshop will bring together top-notch researchers in North America who have significant experience in the development and use of technology for pediatric rehabilitation. The workshop will be organized in four sessions entitled: 1) Identifying Clinical Needs and Developing Technologies; 2) New Frontiers in Rehabilitation Robotics; 3) Measuring and Modeling to Design Better Interventions; and 4) Technologies to Enable New Interventions. The workshop will result in a position paper that will be published in an open access journal. The manuscript will identify areas of research that have potential for achieving significant impact in the field of pediatric rehabilitation.

In the first decade of the 21st century, suburbs saw their poverty populations growing twice as fast as those of central cities because of both internal population movement and immigration. One result is that suburban communities across the country face the challenge of building an adequate social safety net to serve their rapidly diversifying populations. Two factors have emerged as particularly important in this effort: the presence of a suburban network of nonprofits and philanthropic donors, and the strengthening of regional institutional coalitions that can help implement social policies at a metropolitan scale. However, there are also counter currents, such as the decisions by residents of some suburbs to seek community incorporation and thereby separate themselves from the new arrivals. It is still unclear how these dynamics will play out and what the characteristics of the new American suburb will be. <br/><br/>To investigate these developments, Northwestern University doctoral student Elisa Lanari, supervised by Dr. Micaela di Leonardo, will undertake 16 months of research in one such community in the American south. The community is an example of a historically white and affluent suburb that has adopted separatist policies and initiatives in response to the growth of low-income and immigrant populations around them. At the same time, the community also has a strong nonprofit sector committed to helping low-income residents. Therefore, the community constitutes an apt site for investigating the many interacting and dynamic factors that are currently remaking American suburbs. The researcher will use a mix of social science methods to gather data, including: participant observation in nonprofits and at community events and organizational meetings; semi-structured interviews with local homeowners, public officials, business leaders, nonprofit activists, and low-income residents; and analysis of printed and online material produced by media, governmental and non-governmental sources on issues of poverty, socioeconomic polarization, and community organizing in the local area. In the last research phase, she will gather archival and statistical data to provide an overall context. Findings from this research will help policy makers to understand how and why communities that have the infrastructural resources needed to build an adequate suburban safety net do not necessarily deploy them to that end. The research will also contribute to social scientific understanding of the changing dynamics and geography of American suburbs.","maroon"

For these reasons it is critical that fossils and other natural history collections be safely stored and managed to assure open access to these resources for scientists, educators, students, and the general public. The work proposed here consists of packing and moving a large collection of South American fossils to the Duke Lemur Center Division of Fossil Primates (DFP) to ensure its long-term preservation. This collection includes important primate fossils that will be inventoried, cataloged, and digitally archived, along with all locality and collection data. The project will provide full and open access of the entire collection to researchers and the public through a ""virtual museum"" framework. Many aspects of this work will involve the participation of local North Carolina high school students as well as Duke University undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project will secure the fossil primates and associated faunal elements housed in the DFP, a collection of vertebrates from the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene of Egypt (38 to 29 Ma), the early Miocene of Egypt (19.5 Ma), and the latest Pleistocene-Holocene from Madagascar (500 to 15,000 BP). The project will also transfer an important and complementary Middle Miocene collection from La Venta, Colombia to the DFP. The Colombian collection is under imminent risk of displacement and destruction. The fossil primate collections at DFP are critical for testing hypotheses concerning how and when modern groups appeared in time and space. DFP collections enhance study of species diversity and extinction in relation to climate and habitat change. Past events can inform present conservation efforts as living non-human primates become more critically endangered. Open access to 3D renderings and models of DFP specimens will catalyze hypothesis-driven research focused on primate evolution. All updated specimen and georeferenced locality information will be made available for online searches as part of an updated and redesigned DFP website (http://www.fossils.duke.edu/) and will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and educators.

Such research is vital in light of the fact that sea levels are rising more dramatically in the northeast Atlantic than almost anywhere else in the world. Data from long-term population biology and ecology studies provide an invaluable foundation for assessing climate change impacts over the past 30 years and projecting into the future. They are particularly essential for understanding the remaining population of the endangered North Atlantic right whales that feed and nurse their young along the heavily industrialized and developed shore of eastern Massachusetts.<br/><br/>The improvements will more than triple the size of current laboratory space, and expand opportunities for collaboration with other scientific and academic institutions. The new laboratory will consist of facilities for water quality analysis, biological sample analysis and sediment analysis. Expanded laboratory capacity for water quality analysis will be essential in helping the region implement its EPA 208 Water Quality plan and remedy issues of nitrogen pollution in Cape Cod?s bays, inlets and harbors. The new laboratory facilities will also protect sensitive research archives generated by the Center?s multi-decade history of marine mammal research. The improved facilities will increase opportunities for graduate students, interns and apprentices, and enhance CCS?s unique ability and opportunity to interact with the public, thanks to its prominence in environmental education and outreach in a popular tourist destination. CCS?s STEM-based school programs, more than 100 annual public programs, public kiosk and Marine Discovery Center, and other outreach directly impacts nearly 20,000 people of all ages each year. The products of research will also help resource managers to better protect threatened and endangered environments and species.

K-12 students, however, do not have many opportunities to explore such data visualizations, or to author their own. The goal of this project is to design software tools and classroom materials that make exploring and authoring data visualizations accessible in middle grades classrooms. The underlying hypothesis of the project is that by exploring and constructing their own data visualizations, students can develop data literacy, learn core math and science content, and engage in key STEM practices in powerful new ways. <br/><br/>The project involves two interrelated strands: (1) research on grade 6-8 students' knowledge related to data visualization, and (2) the development and study of DataSketch, a tablet-based tool for students to create sketches and program them to respond to archival or live data input. Research will include interviews, studio workshops, and classroom-based studies to explore: (1) what knowledge and skills middle school students have, and need to develop, to interpret and construct data visualizations? (2) how data visualization can be integrated into the grade 6-8 STEM curriculum? and, (3) what role data visualization can contribute to middle students' learning of core STEM practices and content? <br/><br/>Partners include two schools with historically under served student populations in the Greater Boston metro area, and teachers across the greater New England region. There are opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students studying Computer Science and Education at Tufts University to conduct research and outreach at participating middle school sites. There is potential to disseminate resulting classroom activities and software through LEGO, the Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, and iCreate to Educate.","indigo"

Today in the Brazilian Amazon, construction of more than 30 large hydroelectric dams, and approximately 170 smaller dams on tributaries of the Amazon River are underway as a result of long-term governmental plans geared toward increased energy security, economic growth, improved living standards and industrialization. Despite the long history of hydropower development in Brazil, the synergistic, cumulative and long-term effects of dams on rivers, forests, and social systems are still undervalued in planning and decision-making. Uncertainty about the social-ecological effects of dam construction is due in large part to the existing piecemeal approach to analyzing the impacts of dams. This uncertainty highlights an urgent need for coordinated research. The Amazon Dams Network will bring together a diverse set of stakeholders, including fishermen, indigenous peoples, farmers, scientists, students, and decision-makers to address this need. Working together, the network will integrate and coordinate research on how dam construction and operations affect people, their livelihoods, and the environment. Sharing of knowledge, data and technology will occur through workshops, case-study modules, a bilingual website, maps, and published data and papers. <br/><br/>The goal of the Amazon Dams Network is to advance inter- and trans-disciplinary research coordination, focusing on the transformation of social-ecological systems by hydroelectric dam construction in the Amazon and United States. The geographical focus initially includes the Tocantins, Madeira and Xingu River watersheds in the Amazon and the Colorado River watershed in the US. Network activities will focus on four critical integrative themes: a) governance and social actors (an overarching and cross-cutting theme that mediates interactions and outcomes in dammed systems); b) watershed hydrology and geomorphology; c) fish and fisheries; and d) land-use/land-cover change. Focal intersections among these themes to be addressed by the network include feedbacks between hydrologic change and forest ecosystems; human geographic dislocations and land-use change; monitoring and mitigation approaches for Brazilian dams; and the relevance of local knowledge (fishermen, indigenous peoples, riparian communities) for the study and management of systems transformed by infrastructure development. The network will enable data discovery and synthesis, sharing of knowledge, and inter- and transdisciplinary and social learning among participants and the public through a series of activities held at research sites in Brazil and the US, the creation of web-based learning and case studies modules, and the archiving of publically available data.","salmon"

This is especially true for North American moths (Lepidoptera), within which many species lack scientific names. Natural history collections contain substantial amounts of untapped information concerning North American biodiversity that is largely unavailable to non-scientists. The digital revolution that is allowing the integration of photographic images and associated information permits the availability of information on species diversity along with the criteria used to separate species to anyone with internet access. Moreover, the end-user of such information can make important contributions to the knowledge of our fauna if they are given appropriate information on methods used to characterize species. <br/><br/>The Cornell University Insect Collection (CUIC) includes a major North American moth collection, with extensive representation of moth species from much of the United States, especially the mountain forest habitats of the American southwest. The CUIC Lepidoptera holdings total 1.7 million specimens and are currently stored as four separate, parallel collections. These specimens will be integrated into a single comprehensive moth collection reflecting modern classification and up-to-date nomenclature. The currently parallel collections, housed under cramped and partially unsafe storage conditions, will be rehoused in expanded cabinetry incorporating archival storage materials, ensuring long-term preservation of the specimens and full access to all material by researchers. These tasks will be conducted by undergraduate student employees who will receive training in curation and insect taxonomy. Approximately 8700 adult specimens representing at least 2800 species of North American moths will be photographed along with their associated microscope slide-mounted genitalic preparations. These images with associated label data will be uploaded onto the NSF supported Morphbank website, making all images and information available for moth identification or taxonomic description. Approximately 1500 of the specimens in this special collection have never been assigned to a known, described species, supporting their status as representatives of undescribed, cryptic species. An M.S. graduate student will conduct thesis research that emphasizes the use of moth anatomical characters for species discrimination and description. This student will also develop short educational videos that explain various aspects of moth taxonomy, including how to collect moths, how to dissect moths, and how to identify and interpret the morphological characters used for moth identification and taxonomic description. These videos will target knowledgeable amateurs of all ages, thereby integrating the substantial community of citizen scientists into a larger effort to understand our moth fauna. The adult and genitalic moth images will be made available at Morphbank (www.morphbank.net) and shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org). The internet videos as well as the moth images will be linked to the Cornell University Insect Collection website (cuic.entomology.cornell.edu).","puce"

However, habitat destruction, environmental change and incursions by invasive species threaten populations of native land snails. Snails have the highest recorded extinction rate of any major animal group, and the majority of extinctions are from Pacific Islands. The largest Pacific Island land snail collection in the world is at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum (BPBM), which houses six million specimens. Natural history collections are critical to maintain research knowledge and to making decisions about biodiversity conservation. To secure this collection and improve accessibility to critical data for researchers, natural resource managers, students, and the public, this project will rehouse land snail specimens in environmentally stable and protective containers, image all original specimens from which species descriptions are based, and digitize all collection data so as to make these data readily available. The project team will recruit and train college and high school students to assist with this work and students will receive training in topics ranging from systematics to curation and museum conservation. Researchers and students will participate in outreach activities to increase public awareness of invertebrates, including land snails, their importance to natural ecosystems, and for monitoring environmental change, human migration and trade; and in the value of natural history collections to conserving and securing biodiversity.<br/><br/>The security and accessibility of the largest and most biogeographically diverse Pacific Island land snail collection in the world will be ensured by completing the objectives of the project.

The distances between images and portions thereof, the features learned by the extensions of dictionary learning we will construct, and the associated statistical similarities, together with labels provided by experts to be used to train classifiers and algorithms that learn similarities among items to match those provided by expert, will enable us to enrich the current set of capabilities in building these large networks of paintings, to search through them more easily and with more general search patterns, and to visualize them according to different metrics by using dimensionality reduction techniques.<br/><br/>The automatic learning of templates and patterns, and their statistical relationships, in images and signals in general is crucial in a wide variety of applications, such as automating object recognition, and in defining visually meaningful similarities between images, needed to enable searches in large image databases.

These novel techniques will be applied to the data on the Jan Brueghel Research site, that allows scholars to investigate and conceptualize a very different notion of old master pictures. Instead of creating absolute categories of genuine and not-genuine, the team will be drawing a map of interconnections between the thousands of paintings produced in the workshops of early modern Antwerp.

To harness the rich amount of information available, many organizations curate and integrate public (and private) data over time to create a comprehensive temporal view of relevant entities. This project will have the potential to make significant societal impact through the development of a software prototype for data curation and integration. Such a prototype will enable the users to construct robust, application-specific, consistent views of temporal data on demand, which will lead to new classes of applications, particularly those involving profiling, tracking, monitoring, archiving and understanding of the evolution of entities over time. This project will also provide the opportunity to train students in several critical research areas central to temporal databases, data analytics and big data. The results obtained in this investigation will be incorporated into advanced graduate courses on large-scale data integration offered at both SUNY at Buffalo and UC Santa Cruz. The software artifacts and datasets produced will be made freely available for broad dissemination and sharing.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state-of-the-art in data curation and integration over temporal data through addressing three fundamental challenges. First, unlike incompleteness in non-temporal data, incompleteness in temporal data may be time-varying. Time-varying incompleteness will necessitate the introduction of time-dependent nulls. The second challenge is that inconsistency can also occur in temporal data. Inconsistency will be handled by declaratively specifying temporal preferences and algorithms to resolve conflicts based on those preferences. Alternatively, under the assumption that the inconsistent temporal database is left as is, this project will consider how consistent query answers can be computed over such a database. This project will also consider, for the first time, data with both incompleteness and inconsistency in a single formal framework, which will require significant conceptual and practical advances. The third challenge is to achieve temporal data independence through a conceptual framework that will use a formal, two-tier approach to manage temporal data; the abstract view provides the semantics and the concrete view for the physical representation of temporal data. The views hide lower-level details and allow for declarative, logical specification of queries, mappings, and dependencies.

This is certainly the case for field studies of animal behavior, where investigators can seldom focus on more than one or a few species and locales. Comparative research in the behavioral sciences is also hindered by a lack of standards and transparency across research groups as well as a shortage of modern tools and technologies for collecting and managing behavioral data. This project will address these challenges developing strategies and technologies for behavioral research using the collective experience of database specialists, software developers, and field primatologists, a community chosen because it has a vibrant interest in these issues.<br/><br/>There are four key goals to this project:<br/>1. To engage field primatologists and database specialists in developing open data standards that encompass the diversity of the discipline.<br/>2. To create and test a software system for data collection and management that puts these standards into practice. The system will be easily customized and able to run on a variety of mobile devices. Additionally the plans and software source code for it will be published openly for others to review, use, and improve upon.<br/>3. To develop additional software tools that will help behavioral researchers migrate existing data to work with this new system.<br/>4. To encourage researchers and institutional librarians to develop a vision for long-term archiving and curation of behavioral data.<br/><br/>The project will also produce tools for data visualization and analysis, which should encourage investigators to incorporate real-time visual and statistical feedback into their research in both the field and laboratory. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of modern field primatology, this framework is expected to be broadly applicable to researchers from across the social, behavioral, economic, and natural sciences.<br/><br/>This project aims to build an interdisciplinary community of behavioral researchers involving both junior and established scholars. Its products will enable these researchers to collect data more quickly and efficiently while expanding the scope and utility of their data beyond their immediate research questions. Through workshops, tutorials, and documentation, community members will become increasingly data- and design-literate, which will encourage more comparative, ""big data"" projects and spur collaboration across disciplines. A working repository for behavioral data will help foster a culture of data-sharing among researchers. Through an extensive online presence, the project team will communicate with the public about the progress of this project and about the practice of fieldwork, laboratory work, and science in general. The open nature of the project will enable the public to freely adopt and modify any of this project's products for varied and novel purposes. Finally, because the majority of researchers involved in this project are fieldworkers and educators with influence both in the United States and abroad, the ideas and tools produced will be widely disseminated, providing opportunities for education, outreach, and community participation in science.","aquamarine"

One of the most critical conditions to shape the development of life is the composition of Earth's atmosphere. Unlike today's atmosphere, which is approximately 20% oxygen, the atmosphere of the ancient Earth had no oxygen. A major transition in the development of early life has been strongly linked to the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere which began 2.5 - 3 billion years ago, ultimately leading to the biological complexity on our planet today. To better understand the connection of atmospheric oxygen to the development of ancient life, it is important to know how much oxygen was present, particularly in the shallow oceans which served as the cradle of early life. To measure oxygen content in ancient oceans, this research team is developing a method to use a chemical tracer, or fingerprint of oxygen recorded in limestones, analogous to forensic scientists who develop methods to find evidence at a crime scene.<br/><br/>Preliminary data has indicated that the presence of the element iodine (the same substance used as an antiseptic on wounds) in limestones is strongly correlated to the presence of oxygen in Earth's history. However, to reliably determine oxygen concentrations in the ancient atmosphere using iodine as a tracer, it is necessary to understand what factors influence the iodine content of limestones that form in the ocean. The research team in this study will focus on that question with this work by studying the chemistry of iodine in modern and near-modern marine muds and incipient rocks. This work will provide valuable information on iodine chemistry in the modern world, as well as refining and calibrating iodine content as a tracer of ancient oxygen. A new means to fingerprint ancient oxygen has implications for understanding the development of life in ancient times.<br/><br/>Not only can this work potentially contribute to understanding how modern life came to exist, it also has a number of educational impacts. A new collaboration will be initiated between an early-career assistant professor, Zunli Lu (Syracuse University) and senior professor Tim Lyons (University of California Riverside). The project will contribute to building the future US STEM-trained workforce via the training of two graduate students and undergraduates from the diverse campus of UCR. Additionally, the research team plans significant outreach for younger students by working with the new Riverside STEM academy and science fair mentoring. <br/><br/><br/>Technical description.<br/><br/>The shallow waters of the Precambrian ocean were home to the first oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms as well as many of the milestones of early evolution, such as the rise of eukaryotes and ultimately animals. Reliable measurements of the redox conditions in the Precambrian surface ocean are key to understanding the evolution of life during this critical transitional period in Earth's history. Currently, knowledge of oxygen levels in these surface waters is limited. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing a promising new proxy, namely using iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in limestones and dolostones. This iodine method is based upon two observations: (1) the oxidized iodine species iodate exists exclusively in well-oxygenated water and (2) iodate is the only iodine species incorporated during carbonate precipitation.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct the first systematic evaluation of uptake and diagenetic overprints for I/Ca in classic modern/near-modern shallow marine carbonate settings. These plans include tracking diagenesis from shallow to deep burial in South Florida and the Bahamas using independently well constrained samples spanning diverse diagenetic settings and processes ranging from early organic remineralization to meteoric and marine burial conditions to dolomitization.<br/><br/>These carbonate analyses will be complemented with a novel study of iodine uptake and retention in modern organic-rich, shale precursor facies. Assimilation into organic matter represents the largest iodine sink in the modern ocean, and remineralization of this sink and export back to the overlying water column is the largest marine input. Because organic matter mostly assimilates the reduced iodine species, iodide, ratios of I-to-TOC (total organic carbon) in shales paired with carbonate I/Ca should allow for the discrimination of I/Ca trends (or portions of trends) reflecting local redox shifts versus broader reservoir controls. In other words, the proxy, as applied to very old samples, will be taken beyond simple presence-absence scenarios toward questions of global conditions through a quantitative understanding of iodine?s ocean-scale mass balance. Previous studies have noted redox-controlled variations in local I/TOC ratios in modern environments, thus complicating this relationship and its relevance to I/Ca ratios in ancient carbonates. In response, the team will assess iodine uptake and preservation in organic-rich sediments across redox gradients in two classic modern anoxic settings, the Black Sea and the Cariaco Basin. Ultimately, the research team plans to cross-calibrate I/TOC ratios against other diverse and already well-understood proxies for depositional oxygen conditions as archived in black shales and, in the process, to highlight the necessity for a multi-proxy approach to reconstructing the environmental backdrop of Earth's earliest life.","hot_pink"

Examples of such motions range from performing daily activities to breathing and heartbeat during sleep. These various scales of motions can be captured by fine-grained WiFi signals to perform continuous wellbeing monitoring. Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea). Using existing WiFi infrastructure for wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, outreaching to high school students, and engaging both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on building a WiFi enabled continuous wellbeing monitoring framework for fine-grained sleep monitoring and vital signs tracking at home environments. Users do not need to wear any sensors or actively participate in the monitoring process. The proposed framework targets to advance techniques in device-free fine-grained sleep events identification and vital signs tracking during sleep by utilizing existing WiFi signals. The proposed framework develops device-free localization strategies, vital signs tracking methods and statistical learning techniques to depict a comprehensive picture of users' wellbeing. Such wellbeing information is further utilized to assist in real-time disease prediction by leveraging today's ever-growing mobile environments. A hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model is developed to effectively mine through health conditions and identify risk factors of certain diseases. Chances of developing certain health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, is promptly predicted. The project also provides user-centric access control of archived wellbeing monitoring information to ensure data privacy and coping with distrusted servers.","olive"

These have been among the most costly expenditures in the U.S. federal budget and may have important national security consequences. Yet rigorous evidence about how different expenditures influence security, governance, civic engagement, and economic outcomes -- in the short and long run -- remains limited. The investigators will examine these questions using statistical data and opportunities for analysis provided by the Vietnam War. This project aims to provide clear, rigorous empirical findings to policymakers and military planners and to encourage academic research on the Vietnam War by making all data publicly available.<br/><br/>It is difficult to estimate the causal impacts of U.S. military and civic action programs on the development of local economy and civic institutions, because regions where interventions occur are typically very different from those where they do not, and randomized evaluations are often unfeasible. Moreover, data about local governance and civil society rarely exist for a large number of locations, due to the high cost involved in collecting such information. Through extensive archival research, the investigators have produced detailed data and novel opportunities for identification that can shed light on the causal impacts of military actions in South Vietnam. This project will examine the bombing of civilian population centers by exploiting discontinuities in an algorithm used to target air strikes. This project will also empirically explore two alternative strategies for the development of local economy and civic institutions: civic action programs that combined ground troop deployment with participatory development aid, and psychological operations that aimed to change how South Vietnamese citizens thought about the state and the communist insurgency.","crimson"

This project is an attempt to understand how interstellar gas and energetic particles are ejected from galaxy disks, where most of the gas and stars are found, and interact with the galaxy halo. This cyclical process is important for understanding how star formation proceeds in galaxies, and the rate at which galaxies grew when they were forming. The study makes use of radio images from the NSF-funded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), optical data from the Apache Point 3.5-meter telescope, as well as archival infrared data. The project will provide opportunities for two PhD student theses at Hispanic Serving Institutions, and the PIs will also contribute to a training program run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for faculty at small colleges.<br/><br/>Galaxy growth and evolution depend on both the acquisition of gas from the galaxy environment and energetic outflows from disks. The detailed physics of these processes needs to be understood, and nearby edge-on galaxies are the best objects where it is possible to cleanly separate disk and halo components. The project leverages a major new survey of radio continuum emission from edge-on galaxies called CHANG-ES (Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies: an EVLA Survey). The first goal is to further our understanding of the dynamics of disk-halo flows by assessing the role of non-thermal gas pressure gradients in galaxy halos, using radio maps made from the VLA and GBT. The second goal focuses on identifying sites of cosmic ray (CR) injection and propagation into galaxy halos. For this, the spatial variation of the non-thermal spectral index will be mapped, after robustly separating thermal and non-thermal radio emission using CHANG-ES maps in conjunction with infrared data and H-alpha images. The third science goal is to examine the connection between CR outflows and disk-halo cycling of thermal gas, and whether this relation depends on factors such as star formation rate.","lime"

This project aims to develop a relatively untapped reservoir of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic information, speleothems (e.g., stalagmites, and flowstone). Speleothems have immense potential for archiving high quality, high resolution geomagnetic records, and can be dated with supreme precision using radiometric techniques. This research investigates the fundamental processes involved in natural remanence acquisition in speleothems using rock magnetic and microscopic imaging techniques, and establishes chronological constraints for geomagnetic field behavior during specific periods in the last 130 ka.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research project is to construct high-resolution records of geomagnetic field behavior and paleoclimate conditions using the iron oxide mineral assemblages preserved within speleothems. We will address both the mechanical transport and chemical precipitation of iron oxide minerals in speleothems in order to better understand how and when speleothems acquire a recording of the Earth's magnetic field. Recent instrumental progress provides the sensitivity and sample handling capabilities needed to collect a rich variety of magnetic measurements from speleothems, at an unprecedented spatial resolution. The investigation of speleothem magnetization on a sub-millimeter scale will advance the understanding of magnetic processes in speleothems, ranging from changing dripwater conditions to episodic flooding that can be used to produce regional paleohydrology records. Precisely dated, high fidelity paleomagnetic records from speleothems will help better constrain time-dependent, global geomagnetic field models. An additional benefit of having detailed, high-precision chronologies of paleomagnetic variations is that the chronological information can be transferred to existing deposits with correlatable paleomagnetic records, but with less constrained age models (e.g., archaeological sites, and/or sediment cores). High resolution geomagnetic fluctuations recovered from speleothems will contribute valuable information to geodynamo models that focus on small-scale core flow dynamics. The environmental magnetic records of speleothems will bridge the gap that exists between climatic and environmental interpretations from traditional speleothem measurements such as oxygen isotopes, and the environmental magnetic records of other depositional environments.","hot_pink"

The research and education foci are:<br/><br/>Quantum Computing: A promising alternative to current computing paradigms is given by quantum computers that allow for massive parallelism. Nonetheless, many practical challenges remain, such as overcoming the effects of decoherence and showing that quantum algorithms are more efficient than current technologies in solving a broad range of problems. Using methods from the study of disordered systems, the PI will address these problems by understanding the stability of new quantum storage and processing schemes based on topological error codes to different error sources, testing the feasibility of device implementations, and studying the efficiency of quantum optimization algorithms. Given the potential impact on information technology, it is imperative to better understand these quantum computing schemes on theoretical, device-centered, and software levels.<br/><br/>Glassy systems: Many problems across disciplines can be mapped onto glassy systems, for example decision problems in social sciences or the stability of proposals for quantum computing. The PI aims to capitalize on novel algorithms to answer key questions in this area. These include the fundamentals of the behavior of spin glasses in a field, direct simulation of materials, and interdisciplinary applications ranging from decision problems on complex (social) networks to quantum computing.<br/><br/>Computation: A crucial aspect for the successful outcome of the aforementioned scientific goals is the development and improvement of efficient numerical algorithms. The numerical methods developed by the PI can be applied to a wide variety of problems. By making these algorithms and data sets freely available in an archival fashion the proposed research will have a broad impact across disciplines.<br/><br/>Education: Computational methods are fundamental for both experiment and theory. However, current physics curricula do not address this need. By developing an innovative computational physics course that combines class work with hands-on research, the PI will address this issue. The course is designed with an inter-institutional component in mind: all modules will be freely available online. Furthermore, students will be trained in modern programming techniques and the use of high-performance computers, skills that are extremely valuable in academic and industrial settings. The proposal also includes an outreach component aimed at Hispanic minorities, as well as engaging the interest of middle and high-school students.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The advent of fast and cost-effective computers as well as efficient algorithms has made computational physics into a powerful third way, besides experiment and theory, to do research. This CAREER award supports the study of quantum computing proposals and glassy materials by using tools and methods from computational physics and developing new computational tools and methods. <br/>Moore's law has accurately described the speedup of current computer technologies for half a century. However, quantum mechanics suggests exciting possibilities lie beyond Moore's law. A promising alternative is the manipulation of quantum mechanical states for computation. This technique may far surpass the performance of current technologies due to the intrinsic parallelism of quantum mechanical states. A goal of this project is to numerically develop proposed ways to achieve quantum computing by studying their tolerance to different error sources. Many problems across disciplines can be mapped onto spin glasses; a spin glass is a type of magnet in which interactions among the smallest magnetic units at the atomic or molecular level differ significantly and are vary randomly from unit to unit. Unlike an ordinary magnet in which aligning the directions of all the uniformly interacting microscopic magnetic units satisfies the interactions among the magnetic units, the random nature of the interactions makes them difficult to satisfy leading to a challenging computational problem. Understanding the properties of spin glasses, as well as limitations of theoretical pictures describing them can lead to insights across disciplinary boundaries. This project focuses on answering fundamental questions in the field of spin glasses, including the study of spin-glass materials and interdisciplinary applications of the theory.<br/><br/>The PI will develop an innovative computational physics course that combines class work with hands-on research.

Instead, stress was transferred from 40 km north of the capital, Kathmandu, to 8 km to the south, shifting the 2 million population of the Kathmandu Valley about 1.3 m to the southwest in the process. Of major concern is that this stress is now poised, either to diffuse benignly as slow slip, or to be released violently in a future Mw&#8804;7.5 earthquake. US Embassy officials in Kathmandu are concerned that a major aftershock of this size occurring on the outskirts of the capital would have catastrophic consequences to the already weakened buildings of the city, and would greatly impair the rescue operation to the thousands of villages wiped out by the April 25, 2015 earthquake. In this collaborative rapid project, the investigators will install instruments in the region south of Kathmandu to identify what is exactly happening to this stress. The hope is that processes similar to those occurring on the San Andreas fault in California prevail, namely that stress are being released slowly, in which case it would be possible to infer that a future major earthquake is unlikely. The investigators also recognize that the 2015 earthquake may provide clues to future earthquakes near Kathmandu, in that it may be possible to gain insights into what may happen next by re-evaluating historical earthquakes occurred near Kathmandu in the period from 1833 to 1866. The investigators will be collaborating with Nepali students and faculty in Tribhuvan University to undertake these studies. <br/><br/>The investigators plan to install two arrays of GPS units on stable monuments between Kathmandu and the frontal thrusts of the Himalaya- a 35 km wide distance with instrument spacing as close as 5 km. The narrow spacing will permit them to detect slip of the Himalayan dï¿½collement should it be occurring, and will permit them to distinguish various forms of spatial strain diffusion, or locally locked asperities should these exist. Data from each instrument will be telemetered to Boulder and the data will be processed daily and archived with easy public access. A number of campaign GPS sites will be also installed that will be measured at six-month intervals (or more frequently) by students from Tribhuvan University. The investigators envisage that up to eleven additional GPS instruments will be deployed. The investigators plan also to gather time-sensitive intensity data from the epicentral region that may be used to calibrate the attenuation of surface acceleration in the 2015 earthquake. They will use these data to calibrate historical intensity data from the 1833, 1835, 1866,1934 and 1936 Nepal earthquakes, that will used to constrain the rupture areas of these former events, and how they relate to the 2015 earthquake.","hot_pink"

This is certainly the case for field studies of animal behavior, where investigators can seldom focus on more than one or a few species and locales. Comparative research in the behavioral sciences is also hindered by a lack of standards and transparency across research groups as well as a shortage of modern tools and technologies for collecting and managing behavioral data. This project will address these challenges developing strategies and technologies for behavioral research using the collective experience of database specialists, software developers, and field primatologists, a community chosen because it has a vibrant interest in these issues.<br/><br/>There are four key goals to this project:<br/>1. To engage field primatologists and database specialists in developing open data standards that encompass the diversity of the discipline.<br/>2. To create and test a software system for data collection and management that puts these standards into practice. The system will be easily customized and able to run on a variety of mobile devices.

To encourage researchers and institutional librarians to develop a vision for long-term archiving and curation of behavioral data.<br/><br/>The project will also produce tools for data visualization and analysis, which should encourage investigators to incorporate real-time visual and statistical feedback into their research in both the field and laboratory. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of modern field primatology, this framework is expected to be broadly applicable to researchers from across the social, behavioral, economic, and natural sciences.<br/><br/>This project aims to build an interdisciplinary community of behavioral researchers involving both junior and established scholars. Its products will enable these researchers to collect data more quickly and efficiently while expanding the scope and utility of their data beyond their immediate research questions. Through workshops, tutorials, and documentation, community members will become increasingly data- and design-literate, which will encourage more comparative, ""big data"" projects and spur collaboration across disciplines. A working repository for behavioral data will help foster a culture of data-sharing among researchers. Through an extensive online presence, the project team will communicate with the public about the progress of this project and about the practice of fieldwork, laboratory work, and science in general. The open nature of the project will enable the public to freely adopt and modify any of this project's products for varied and novel purposes. Finally, because the majority of researchers involved in this project are fieldworkers and educators with influence both in the United States and abroad, the ideas and tools produced will be widely disseminated, providing opportunities for education, outreach, and community participation in science.","aquamarine"

These deposits also contain important energy and water reserves and will serve as hosts for carbon capture and storage. In order to manage these resources and understand sedimentary deposits, improved methods are needed for interpreting and predicting stratigraphic patterns. Internally generated (autogenic) dynamics in sedimentary systems can generate stratigraphy that mimics patterns produced by tectonics, climate, and sea level changes. Statistical methods are needed to filter autogenic signals from sedimentary deposits in order fully understand and model stratigraphy. This project aims to determine the primary controls on autogenic sedimentation patterns and develop methods for identifying and filtering autogenic signals from the stratigraphic record. Through a combination of experiments, numerical modeling, and fieldwork, PIs will map and measure stratigraphic organization produced by rivers and deltas with different sizes and characteristic avulsion timescales. This work will advance our ability to recover meaningful data about autogenic processes from stratigraphic datasets, isolate preserved signals of changing environmental conditions in ancient deposits, and generate predictive stratigraphic models in alluvial basins.<br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Using the stratigraphic record to understand the evolution of river and delta environments will improve our ability to manage natural resources and forecast the response of deltas to climate change. In an effort to increase public understanding about how sediment is transported through river deltas and how these deltas evolve through time PIs will hold short courses at Tulane University?s Sediment Dynamics Laboratory for high school students and teachers. These courses will be developed in collaboration with Abramson Science & Technology Charter School in New Orleans, which was founded after Hurricane Katrina to improve the science and math education of underprivileged communities in New Orleans. During these interactive courses students will build an experimental delta and explore its reaction to changing environmental conditions, including rising sea level. The faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates working on this research project will facilitate these classes. Additionally, funding for this project will support two PhD students and several undergraduate researchers and will help two early career faculty establish successful research programs.","hot_pink"

Under this system, plaintiffs and defendants are entitled to request relevant evidence from each other. Although digital records seem easier to find than their older paper counterparts, rapid growth in the volume, diversity, and possible locations of these records has actually made it harder to find the proverbial needles within the digital haystacks. The resulting rapid increase in the cost of discovery and exchange of relevant evidence, if left unchecked, raises concerns about access to justice. Hence, there is an urgent need for demonstrably accurate and cost-effective technologies to support ""e-discovery"" of the relevant records.<br/><br/>Professor Douglas W. Oard and colleagues of the University of Maryland are developing techniques to automatically decide within minutes the responsiveness of more documents than one person could examine in a lifetime. These techniques use ""semi-supervised learning"" algorithms for ""training"" the software to replicate the kinds of decisions that people make on representative examples. Using Finite Population Annotation, a new framework for integrating learning with evaluation, novel methods are being developed to achieve and measure the highest possible effectiveness for any specified level of human effort. These learning methods draw on rich approaches to representing the content of both born-digital structured documents and scanned paper. Measures for rigorously assessing the effectiveness of the resulting automated review techniques are being developed both to support decisions by legal professionals and by the courts about which methods to use, and to help developers further improve their algorithms.<br/><br/>The legal system demands technology whose effectiveness has been demonstrated on collections that are representative of what is actually expected in a real case. For that reason, this project is creating real world benchmarks in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Text Retrieval Conference (TREC). The project's results are expected to help to shape professional practice through workshops for legal and technical stakeholders, and through university courses to prepare the next generation of attorneys and information professionals to employ these new capabilities. ""E-discovery"" technologies resulting from this effort are likely to be broadly applicable in domains beyond the law practice, including preparation of systematic reviews of scientific literature, scholarly access to digital archives, and government responses to public information requests from citizens.

But the data for constructing such maps for the Cambrian and Ordovician Periods, a time of greenhouse climate, are exceedingly sparse for the northern half of the continent, and the Arctic regions in general. This project will improve that situation through detailed study of Cambrian-Ordovician trilobite (extinct marine arthropod) faunas)from the Arctic Alaska Terrane (AAT) of northern Alaska, and the Yukon Stable Block (YSB) of eastern Alaska. It will utilize large fossil collections archived by geologists of the U.S. and Canadian Geological Surveys over the past century, supplemented by new material collected in several key areas in Alaska. The goal for the AAT is to test, by comparing newly discovered faunas from its North Slope Subterrane (NST) with trilobites previously reported from the Seward Terrane (ST) in western Alaska, the hypothesis that the thick limestone succession in the NST was deposited somewhere in northeastern (modern coordinates) North America, whereas the ST originated in or near Siberia. In the YSB, thorough documentation of rocks and fossils in the Jones Ridge Limestone will refine correlation with rocks of the same age in other regions. For many of the horizons targeted for study, the data from Jones Ridge will be the first information acquired from the entire northern half of the continent. The refined time control through this thick (ca. 450m) stack of limestone preserved near the northwestern corner of North America will serve to test the claim of continent wide (and perhaps global) extent for numerous events documented across broad areas in the U.S. and southern Canada, on the opposite side of the continent. These include (among others), 1) a number of significant rises and falls in sea level and 2) episodes of platform-wide suppression of microbial reef development in the aftermath stage boundary extinctions in the late Cambrian. <br/><br/> The scientific results of the proposed project will benefit society by advancing knowledge of the Arctic region, an area rich in vital resources but still a frontier with respect to our understanding of even basic aspects of its tectonic history. Extensive involvement of undergraduate Geology majors and Earth and Space Science Education majors as junior collaborators in the project will produce a cadre of professional geoscientists with exceptional insight and secondary school teachers able to teach science with the enthusiasm and knowledge of someone who has actually done science.","hot_pink"

Equivalent temperature is a metric that considers the total energy content of near-surface air by accounting for both the dry (sensible heat) and moist (latent heat) components. It therefore aligns well with human heat stress, which increases when temperature and humidity are simultaneously elevated. Because equivalent temperature is sensitive to changes in both temperature and humidity, variations in equivalent temperature can reflect processing occurring across a range of scales from global to regional. The objective of this project is to diagnose and attribute historical changes in equivalent temperature to processes occurring at the regional scale (e.g. changes in humidity resulting from soil moisture anomalies), the synoptic scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in the atmospheric circulation), and the global scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases). The project will investigate these processes within coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models and regional climate models in the context of developing 21st-century equivalent temperature projections.<br/><br/>This project will address research needs identified in the National Climate Assessment process: to better understand atmospheric responses to atmospheric composition change and to improve understanding of atmospheric changes that may threaten human health and well-being. Equivalent temperature variability has not been previously considered in terms of multiple scales of influence. Attributing variations in equivalent temperature to the underlying processes across the spatial scales at which they act will allow exploration of mechanistic understanding of equivalent temperature tendencies in the historical record. Downscaling atmosphere ocean general circulation models using statistical and dynamical approaches with knowledge of the driving processes will allow the researchers to develop the best available projections of future equivalent temperature output and to contextualize those projections within a rigorous understanding of drivers of historical change. The results of the project will have broad implications for climate change adaptation and planning, because changes in equivalent temperature and its components may be critical for both human health and agriculture this century. Project results will be institutionally archived and made available to the research community. The project provides support for multiple graduate students at each institution, and thus contributes to development of the next generation of geographers and atmospheric scientists.","maroon"

Such conditions pose an immediate security and conservation risk to NCMS fossil specimens, particularly to scientifically significant holdings that are deteriorating from pyrite disease. This project will rehouse the NCSM paleontological holdings into museum-grade steel cabinets with archival materials following best practices in specimen conservation. The project will also introduce underserved public school students to citizen science where they will improve open-access natural history specimen data via measurements and 3D models and will integrate deeply with multiple existing NCSM programmatic efforts including a youth science communication opportunity to document and broadcast the project in action to public school audiences. <br/><br/>Rehousing will greatly increase the security, value, and long-term research and educational viability of the NCSM Paleontological Collection, which includes significant holdings in Ediacaran invertebrates, Cretaceous - Cenozoic echinoids, and one of the most extensive collections of Late Triassic vertebrates from eastern North America. The Paleontological Collection is an active resource for research and education, including public university courses taught annually by museum staff either inside the museum's on-exhibition Paleontology Research Lab or in the collections area. These activities regularly engage graduate and undergraduate students, and museum visitors with specimen-based paleontological research. NCSM receives about 1 million visitors each year and is free to the public, engaging culturally and socio-economically diverse audiences. This project capitalizes on specimen rehousing to broadly impact existing NCSM programs as well as create new STEM opportunities targeted for pre-professionals at multiple levels (underserved 9-12, undergraduate, and graduate students). Initiatives include the launch of a new citizen science program - Junior Curator: Fossil Collections - designed to increase open-access morphological data from NCSM paleontological specimens and engage local underserved students. Other goals are aimed at garnering community engagement with natural history collections by broadcasting a behind-the-scenes peek at collections care via live, scientist-to-classroom connections within the North Carolina Public School System; new content creation via NCSM's digital media production program TeenTV; monthly presentations in the NCSM's free Daily Planet Theater; and established NCSM social media platforms (e.g., multiple blog sites, Twitter, and live expedition websites.) Planned professional deliverables include iDigBio webinars. Results can be viewed at (collections.naturalsciences.org). This project will also support NCSM's demonstrated commitment to increasing accessibility of the Paleontological Collection as an external research resource. All paleontology collections at NCSM were recently registered with GRBIO and Earth Cube, and can be accessed via the Museum's website, The Gobal Biodiversity Information Facility, VertNet (invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology collections only) and iDigBio (idigbio.org).","puce"

While the hearing population has benefited from advances in speech technologies such as speech recognition and spoken web search, much less progress has been made for sign language interfaces. Advances depend on improved technology for analyzing sign language from video. In addition, the linguistics of sign language is less well-understood than that of spoken language. This project addresses both of these needs, with an interdisciplinary approach that will contribute to research in linguistics, language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Applications of the work include better access to ASL social media video archives, interactive recognition and search applications for Deaf individuals, and ASL-English interpretation assistance.<br/><br/>This project focuses on handshape in ASL, in particular on one constrained but very practical component: fingerspelling, or the spelling out of a word as a sequence of handshapes and trajectories between them. Fingerspelling comprises up to 35% of ASL, depending on the context, and includes 72% of ASL handshapes, making it an excellent testing ground. The project addresses gaps in existing work by focusing on handshape in various conditions, including fast, highly coarticulated signing. The main project activities include development of (1) robust automatic detection and recognition of fingerspelled words using new handshape models, including segmental and ""multi-segmental"" graphical models of ASL phonological features; (2) techniques for generalizing across signers, styles, and recording conditions; (3) improved phonetics and phonology of handshape, in particular contributing to an articulatory phonology of sign; and (4) publicly released multi-speaker, multi-style fingerspelling data and associated semi-automatic annotation.","indigo"

However, we still do not understand the physical mechanisms that cause the first spark of a lightning flash or that allow the spark to grow into a conducting channel that travels to ground first through the cloud and then through the air. Intracloud flashes, those which move only inside and around a cloud (but not to ground), are a hazard for aircraft and space-bound rockets just after launch. This project aims to gain a better understanding of the important processes in lightning initiation, lightning propagation through cloud and air, and lightning evolution from a small spark to an electrical discharge that is miles long and can strike in multiple locations that are miles apart. The project will use existing data from a unique array of sensors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>This project will utilize data collected in summer 2011 around NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, under a prior NSF award. The data come from a combination of six sensor sets, each of which reveals different information about a flash. Three systems were operated by KSC and provided data on the lightning paths (composed of short steps), the overall lightning charge, and lightning ground strike points. Two research arrays of electric field change sensors provided data on the location and amount of electric current for different parts of the flash; these currents can travel 50 yards to several miles in one-thousandth of a second or less. The sixth sensor was a high-speed video camera (operating at 50,000 fps) which yields detailed information on any luminous features of the lightning, including flash initiation and positive and negative charge motion. Seven scientific articles have already been published using this dataset and seven more are either under review or being written. However, the available multi-sensor dataset remains very rich and deep. For example, on one day (August 14, 2011) there were 25,500 intracloud and 1,700 cloud-to-ground flashes within 50 miles of KSC, and there are similarly good data on 15 storm days. Thus, there is much as-yet-unstudied data that can be used to learn new details about lightning initiation, propagation, and evolution. The project will be aided by many computer tools developed in a prior NSF award; these tools will enhance the data analysis from day one of this project. This project will also extend the previous dataset by including archived data from the Melbourne National Weather Service radar located near KSC. The additional radar data will allow comparisons of lightning initiation, propagation, and development to the thunderstorm reflectivity parameters (and other radar parameters) used by weather forecasters. Thus, the main intellectual merit of the study is that it will use existing data to advance the understanding of lightning mechanisms and better characterize the evolution of lightning structure throughout the thunderstorm lifecycle.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Kennedy Space Center is located in a region with one of the largest numbers of lightning flashes per year; these flashes endanger the workers, space-bound vehicles, and special equipment at KSC. With its mission to safely launch rockets carrying satellites and astronauts, NASA is especially concerned about lightning. To continue reducing the lightning threat for the general public and for NASA, it is essential to better understand how lightning works; this project aims to advance that understanding. The project will be important for the development and training of several new scientists, including one post-doctoral researcher, one research associate, two graduate students, and two undergraduate physics students interested in scientific research. The training involves data analysis techniques that are specific to electromagnetic measurements of lightning as well as techniques that are generally applicable in many situations (including computer programming, computational modeling, and oral and written dissemination of results). Four of the eight anticipated project personnel are women. The results of this project will also be broadly disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature. Thus, the main broader impacts of this project are the potential reduction in lightning threats based on better understanding of lightning and the training of new and diverse scientists and engineers.","fuchsia"

The AGN themselves, lying at the very center of the galaxies, are explained as having a torus of gas and dust that blocks light from the inside, and can obscure the AGN central engine (the black hole). However, astronomers don't fully understand the exact properties of the torus, and directly viewing the torus with telescopes is extremely difficult. In this proposal, the PI plans to address the key questions of: (a) What material makes up the torus, and how is it connected to the rest of the gas and dust between the stars of the host galaxy? (b) How do the torus properties, such as geometry and thickness, depend on the brightness of the AGN? (c) Do the properties of the dust in the torus change with the AGN brightness? and (d) What is the role of star formation near the AGN in the centers of galaxies in feeding and/or blocking AGN? Answers to these questions will provide insight into how the AGN is fueled by gas in the galaxy and how that might have an impact on the formation of the galaxy itself. <br/><br/>Through the PI's network of collaborators, the proposed work will aid in furthering links in astronomy in the developing nation of Mexico, and it promotes involvement of US Spanish-speaking team members, primarily Hispanics, through connections with Spain and Mexico. The PI also plans to work with local high-school teachers to enhance their understanding and teaching of astronomical topics. In this way, he hopes to reach local school children in the San Antonio area, an area of high diversity, providing high quality scientific content, and encouraging the students (including underrepresented minorities) to pursue scientific fields. The intent is to use the interesting astronomical content as a ""gateway"" to STEM subjects. <br/><br/><br/>Observations at mid-infrared (MIR: 7-26 microns) wavelengths are essential, as the torus intercepts a large amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted from near the black hole and re-radiates it in this waveband. MIR facilities such as the 8m Subaru telescope and the Gran Telescope Canarias (GTC) offer the possibility to probe the centers of AGN at MIR wavelengths with high spatial resolution. <br/><br/>Models assuming clumpy dust distribution in AGN are making significant progress explaining MIR emission. High-resolution observation will help constrain model parameters and provide insight into torus physical properties. This proposal would fund analysis of data from ~100 hours of guaranteed time (GT) on the GTC and an additional 180 hours of ESO-GTC time (jointly ESO and GTC allocated time, competitively awarded as part of Spain's ascension to ESO membership). This would be combined with archival data from Gemini to tackle a key problem in AGN research.<br/><br/>A detailed understanding of the torus, the AGN/black hole fueling process and its relationship to (or even creation of) the torus, the interaction with the host galaxy, and dust chemistry in other galaxies will be constructed. Simulations based on current data to prepare new observations for next generation facilities (such as SOFIA, JWST, TMT, etc.) are planned.","lime"

This research project will expand the explanatory power of land-change research by considering a factor that has not been adequately studied, namely social processes stemming from unequal access to land resources. The project's investigators will broaden the concept of land-change agency or responsibility, often deployed uncritically in land-change research, by considering social actions and reactions occurring over decadal time periods and by actors who do not always behave in economically ""rational"" ways. The researchers will develop a comprehensive perspective on land change for southeastern Para state of northern Brazil, a laboratory and battleground for myriad Amazonian development initiatives. To characterize land change between 1984 and 2010, including deforestation, reforestation, and forest patch dynamics, the researchers will employ remote sensing and landscape ecology techniques. To examine the social process aspects of land change, especially contention over land, they will conduct a thorough news media analysis covering more than 5,000 news accounts of conflict. They will complement this archival research with field interviews and intensive case-studies involving at least five landowners and many local key informants. By mixing field interviews with remote sensing and landscape ecology, the researchers will treat Amazonian land change as an integrated system of processes, not just a singular process of deforestation driven by ""rational"" economic decisions. The investigators expect to find that properties that play host to contention displayed greater overall deforestation and increased (or different) forest fragmentation patterns than for properties that were not contested. The researchers will seek to ascertain whether contention has led to a forest structure shift, creating a more complex forest landscape with negative implications for the region's ecology.<br/><br/>This project will reframe land change in the study area as a process occurring within a context of social contention, and it will shed light on how social processes and multiple, sometimes simultaneous, land managers affect land change. The project will help extend accepted theories and perspectives in land-change science, specifically responding to recent calls for opening behavior-based explanations of land change to the influences of social processes and power relations. By evaluating the environmental implications of land conflict, the project will shed light on how conflict could affect the contribution of tropical deforestation to global climate change. It will provide new perspectives for evaluating initiatives to reduce deforestation via the UN's REDD program and have policy relevance in many other nations. By adopting an active learning paradigm, students will study complex issues of societal import in all their ""real world"" messiness in undergraduate courses in the U.S. and Brazil.","maroon"

Most techniques in seismology apply averaging methods, which smooth out wave field differences that may reflect real structure or complexity. Wave gradiometry methods are designed to take advantage of these wave field variations to resolve structure that cannot be derived strictly from averaging methods. The amazing thing about gradiomery is that if the spatial gradients of the wave field are known at a single seismic station, then the wave slowness, wave azimuth, change in geometrical spreading and radiation can also be determined at that point. The beauty of the EarthScope USArray, therefore, is that it provides an opportunity to quantify the spatial gradients of wave fields on a scale never before possible. This proposed work will involve further development and use of the wave gradiometry method in discovery-based research across the entire USArray, which will lead to new vital constraints for resolving 3-D structure within the lithosphere and upper-most mantle asthenosphere.<br/><br/>We now have an important opportunity to take advantage of information within the wave fields, sampled by USArray, that have not been exploited to date. This observational approach, involving quantification of the displacement gradients within the wave fields, is the next important step in seismology that, when combined with theory, has the potential to lead to new important discoveries regarding 3-D structural complexity. We present here new adaptations to gradiometry method, including treatment of continuous displacement gradient fields within subarrays, and the use of multiple time series of spatial gradients obtained for each seismic station using reciprocity principle. Another important component of our research is the work with synthetic data (1) for calibration and to 'ground truth' the method and (2) for a better understanding of how wave field parameters estimates (slowness, wave azimuth, changes in geometric spreading, and radiation pattern) are linked with structural complexity, including the influence of lateral variations in anisotropy. Phase velocity maps generated to date show interesting jumps in velocity near some major terrane boundaries, indicating that some of these features extend deep into the mantle lithosphere. Furthermore, results from two events in Vanuatu show that changes in geometrical spreading and radiation are consistent with focusing and defocusing of energy as it propagates through low/high velocity zones. Use of such information from multiple different events, and from multiple different back azimuths, has the potential to be transformational in areas such as 3-D tomographic inversions. The Broader Impact of this work will consist of the training of a Ph.D. student, Yuanyuan Liu, the training of Undergraduate and High School students who will work in the lab during the funding period, and the generation of educational products involving wave field animations. The P.I. has a strong track record in working with both undergraduates and High School students. This substantial effort in mentoring will continue during the proposed period. During the funding period we will produce, and make available, wave field animations (animations of strain) as an educational product. These animations show the dilatations, shear, and rotations (see snap shot in Figure 1) associated with the wave fields that cross USArray. These will be useful for visualizing a component of the field that few researchers or students are used to thinking about, thereby providing the opportunity for unexpected insight and discovery. All codes will be shared, and displacement gradient tensor fields determined from the USArray seismograms will be archived using the NSF-supported Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) facility. An integrated model website will be set up where we will provide data sets that are used in the published models, published model results, benchmarking exercises and files, codes and tutorials for all gradiometry modeling, and wave field animations. Results are expected to be published in a timely way and they plan to make all data sets and codes, along with tutorials, available on the web site.","hot_pink"

This proposal aims to contribute towards gaining improved information on the exposure component of hazard assessment. Even for the high production volume (HPV) NMs used today in society (TiO2 and SiO2) there is a paucity of field monitoring data on their concentration or frequency of occurrence in aquatic systems. Environmental monitoring of NMs on the cusp of widespread use (e.g., Ag0, CeO2, CNT, C60, etc.) or futuristic high value-added NMs will remain unattainable unless frameworks and analytical methods exist to understand where and how to find NMs. We propose developing and applying a framework for monitoring NMs in the environment. Nanoprospecting is the first stage of this investigative framework, involving monitoring for the presence of HPV and emerging NMs at critical inputs to and points along the urban water system. Bulk food ingredients are a major potential source of NMs into the urban water system. To compliment the use of existing analytical approaches available today to detect NMs at environmentally relevant concentrations, we propose improvements to post-processing of data signals from specific instrumentation and discovering the suitability of several NM extraction techniques that leverage a unique property of NMs by exploiting the unique phenomena of NMs that a minimum free energy exists for NMs at the solvent-water or water-solid interface. By monitoring for a few NMs in the environment today, information and data can be collected and used in validating life cycle models. Research is organized around the following four research components: (1) Nanoprospecting across an urban water gradient; (2) Nanoprospecting in the food supply system; (3) Using interfaces for nanomaterial extraction from water; (4) Framework for long-term monitoring of aquatic systems for nanomaterials.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>Nanoprospecting builds upon experiences of the environmental community dealing with other emerging contaminants and technologic shifts, and is complimentary to life cycle perspectives. Specifically, this project will provide the scientific community with estimates of realistic human (through food) and ecosystem (through urban water gradients) exposure levels and characteristics of ""real"" nanomaterials, as opposed to NMs purchased or synthesized solely for research-grade testing. New extraction methodologies and signal processing of analytical response data will be developed. The research is motivated by the following scientific questions: What is the frequency in detection of nanomaterials across the urban water gradient? What are the occurrences and characteristics of nanoscale TiO2 and SiO2 in bulk food ingredients and finished food products? How can the unique property that nanoscale objects adsorb at liquid or solid interfaces be harnessed to extract nanomaterials from water and facilitate their characterization? Could a monitoring framework and network of monitoring stations be established to provide baseline and longer-term data on nanomaterials in water? <br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/>By focusing on field-scale monitoring we hope to lead the environmental nanotechnology field toward establishing protocols suitable for monitoring NMs at environmentally relevant concentrations. The researchers have a proven commitment to mentoring gender and ethnically iverse undergraduate and graduate students. The graduate student funded by this project will participate in Science Outside the Lab, a two-week immersive seminar in Washington, DC that explore how science becomes policy. The project connects with the NSF Central-Arizona hoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP-LTER) program, taking a similar longitudinal approach looking at NMs along the urban water gradient, and field data collected by this project will become part of the CAP-LTER data archives. The research team has a record of onducting research of interest and visible to the public, and will continue to strive to share our results with the public, including working with the Center for Nanotechnology in Society at ASU.","coral"

In design of steel buildings, the gravity framing is not usually considered as contributing to the resistance of seismic lateral load. In reality, however, the gravity framing can contribute substantial lateral load resistance and significantly improve seismic performance. At present, a full understanding of this role is still lacking. Moreover, the data and models needed to quantify the effect of the gravity framing system on seismic performance are also largely lacking. This study will develop a database of previous experiments on typical simple beam-to-column shear connections used in gravity framing, generate new experimental data from a series of large-scale experiments on simple shear connections under combined gravity and cyclic lateral load, develop connection models at various levels of complexity and detail, and develop preliminary system level models for gravity framing. This research will also provide information needed to conduct a follow-on research project examining system level behavior of combined gravity and lateral systems in steel buildings.<br/><br/>This research has the potential for significant practical impact on seismic design and evaluation procedures for new and existing steel buildings in the United States, with a broader goal of improved safety and economy. The largest impact is likely to be on the evaluation of seismic safety of existing steel buildings, where inclusion of the gravity system in the evaluation may, in a number of cases, preclude the need for costly seismic retrofit measures. This research will also provide greater insights into how the gravity system affects seismic performance of new steel buildings, and will provide information on best practices for the design and detailing of the gravity system in new buildings. This research also has potential impact on the seismic design of new steel buildings in lower seismic zones in the United States, where the contribution of the gravity framing to lateral seismic resistance may be substantial. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.

To address this problem, the research team will 'virtually' extract the most complete primate skeletons yet known from the Eocene (48 million years old) of North America using 3D imaging technology for museum samples and newly collected specimens from the Bridger Basin, Wyoming.

Because of their completeness, Bridger skeletons provide evidence allowing critical tests of these ideas, transforming understanding of early primate evolution through detailed analyses of their anatomy in evolutionary context. Additionally, new evidence on the anatomy of early primates will allow tests of competing phylogenetic hypotheses about whether these Eocene primates are more closely related to anthropoids (monkeys, apes, and humans), strepsirrhines (lemurs, lorises, and galagos), or perhaps represent a more primitive branch of the primate tree. Finally, Bridger skeletons will provide the first detailed characterization of locomotor and positional behavior in these specimens, clarifying this aspect of the adaptive context for the origin and early evolution of primates. Examining the anatomy of the new skeletons in evolutionary context will test the idea that several early primate lineages may have independently evolved specialized acrobatic leaping, previously considered to be a uniting characteristic of primates.<br/><br/>This project includes the involvement of five undergraduate students; a postdoctoral scholar; hosting of lab and field workshops involving K-12 educators, fossil clubs, and local museums; and posting of digital atlases of skeletons on a publicly accessible website (www.morphosource.org).

Social scientists have documented the enivronmental controversies and local resistance that sometimes accompany these practices, as well as the movements calling for more sustainable and environemtnally benign forms of energy. But less attention has been paid to communities that favor petroleum development. That is the subject of the research supported by this award, which will be undertaken by University of Colorado doctoral student, Gregorio Ortiz, under the supervision of anthropologist, Dr. Jerry K. Jacka. The researchers ask: How do communities that support fracking engage with the environmental discourse against it? How do people in such communities understand their place within environmental discourse and are these conceptions affected by their support of extractive development? Is local extractive development, in turn, affected by the sensibilites of local communities? Findings from this research will fill critical gaps in scientific understanding of the social and environmental impacts of resource extraction.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted around the on-going development of the Eagle Ford Shale in south Texas. The region is an appropriate site because it has a long history of petroleum development and natural environmental challenges, such as drought. The oil boom of the 1970s and 1980s shaped the area's recent history even though it did not always lead to infrastructural development nor improved livelihoods. Consequently, the subsequent resource ""bust"" has affected local livelihoods in complex ways, which makes the study of why local residents support further petroleum development particularly interesting. Ortiz will focus on the communities of the Middle Rio Grande Development Council of Governments in south Texas. He will use a mix of social science methods beginning with archival research; semi-structured interviews with both governmental and non-governmental local and state representatives whose work engages the petroleum industry; and participant observations and interviews with petroleum industry workers. He will then move on to in-depth ethnography, participant observation, and surveys in two local communities. Data collection activities will include interviews, focus groups, and local land and resource mapping. The researcher will highlight how environmental concerns do and do not inform development policy and projects, and if and how perspectives on the environment have changed since the development of the Eagle Ford Shale began. Findings from this study will contribute to the development of more complete social science theory about the relationship between development, energy, and environmental judgment. Findings may also inform development of community-appropriate energy policy.","maroon"

The complexity of the issues facing science policymakers has increased proportionately, requiring more sophisticated methods and techniques to support decision-making. Recognizing these developments, in 2005, John Marburger, science advisor to President George W. Bush, called on the members of the science and innovation policy community to apply the latest scientific methods in order to make their research more rigorous and systematic. In response, the National Science Foundation (NSF), which has long been a focus such work, established the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program. SciSIP builds on NSF's fifty-plus year history of science and innovation policy studies. Beginning in the mid-1960s, NSF established programs aimed at cultivating science policy research and teaching at academic institutions. Later, in the mid-1970s, it created a Division of Policy Research and Analysis (PRA) to conduct and support studies of the social returns to R&D. The results of PRA and related programs provide an intellectual background for the practice of science and innovation policy. This project strengthens the management and direction of the SciSIP program and its impact by providing a better understanding of its genesis and broader scientific context. It is also helping to build a stronger foundation for both graduate and undergraduate education in science and innovation policy.<br/><br/>Drawing on unpublished archival materials, published sources, interviews and correspondence, this project examines the range of past science and innovation policy research programs, their strengths and weaknesses, and their contributions to policy and to the development of the field. The project is looking at how NSF and other agencies laid the foundations of U.S. science and innovation policy research, how institutional support was used to seed academic science policy programs and build capacity both inside and outside of the federal government, and finally, how the advent of SciSIP has affected the course of science and innovation policy research.","aquamarine"

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Lauren Cline is ""Fungal responses to anthropogenic N deposition: a historical perspective."" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Minnesota, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Peter Kennedy and Jessica Gutknecht. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to measure the belowground responses of plants and fungi to historical increases in nitrogen pollution. The Fellow is accomplishing this goal by analyzing long-term trends in stable isotope signatures of plants and fungi from archived biological collections. Over the last century, human-caused nitrogen (N) deposition has doubled the amount of N entering the biosphere, mostly due to burning of fossil fuels. N is a nutrient that limits plant growth in temperate and boreal ecosystems, and experiments manipulating N supply have revealed dramatic, albeit relatively short-term, belowground responses to high rates of N deposition. As primary regulators of N and carbon cycling in soils, microbial responses to increased deposition will have important consequences for plant production and belowground carbon storage. However, we do not understand the mechanisms by which current rates of anthropogenic N deposition have altered biogeochemical cycling, or if experimental responses match long-term ecosystem consequences. Isotopic analyses of long-term fungal and plant collections present an innovative approach to track the changing role of fungi in supplying N to plants, and allows for direct comparison between historical anthropogenic N deposition and experimental N studies. The Fellow's research is revealing forest ecosystem responses at current N deposition rates and the plant and fungal traits that elicit ecosystem responses. To date, no study has used fungal herbaria specimens to investigate long-term soil responses to N deposition; thus the Fellow's research represents a transformative approach to advance our understanding of global ecological responses amidst rapid environmental change.<br/><br/>The Fellow is being trained in stable isotope analysis and in utilizing biological collections to add a long-term perspective not possible with experimental approaches. The Fellow is actively engaged in educational outreach, including the training of undergraduate researchers from underrepresented groups, and developing biological content knowledge and inquiry-based classroom activities with local elementary school teachers. The Fellow is also undertaking outreach activities with the Bell Museum at the University of Minnesota. Finally, the Fellow's research has important implications for environmental stewardship, as it is revealing forest ecosystem responses to N pollution.","puce"

Under high-speed conditions, the flow is turbulent. The proposal focuses on this interaction under supersonic conditions where compressibility also plays a role. The flow geometry chosen is high-speed reacting shear flow over cavity, which is commonly believed to be a good candidate for supersonic combustion and propulsion. The proposed facility (located at the lead PI's institution - UVa) is unique, which has been developed over the past decades and is well and appropriately leveraged for the proposed research. Fundamental data on flame structure and statistics on key species are to be obtained experimentally. Computational results using DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation) will supplement the experiments to provide additional information not accessible from experiments in developing submodels, which can be used in the future development of high-speed propulsion combustors. The experimental data are of archival value. Close collaboration proposed with researchers from government labs would likely amplify its usefulness.","coral"

Because snow insulates soils from below-freezing air temperatures, loss of snow cover will increase the frequency of freeze - thaw events in winter. Past studies show that soil freezing increases movement of nitrogen from forest soils to nearby waterways and the atmosphere, but the causes of these patterns are not well understood, especially the role of soil microbes. The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the response of soil microbes to these changes, and the consequences for nitrogen loss downstream. This project will also produce a number of societal benefits. First, understanding connections among soils, plants, and climate will improve predictions of the response of temperate forests to climate change, critical information to better understand feedbacks between the biosphere and a changing climate. In addition, this research will provide new educational activities for students at multiple grade levels. High-school students in the Boston public school system will gain valuable hands-on, independent research experience and training in a range of field and laboratory methods. Undergraduate students from Boston University, an urban campus, will have a rare opportunity to take field trips to the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research site to learn about winter climate change. Finally, data generated by this research will be incorporated into an undergraduate microbiology class and used to train undergraduate students in current methods in this growing field.<br/><br/>Past studies have shown that reductions in snow cover increase the intensity of winter soil freezing, which can increase ecosystem nitrogen loss via leaching and gas loss to the atmosphere. Because the abundance and diversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities can have significant effects on soil nitrogen cycling, sustained changes in microbial community structure might explain the positive effect of winter soil freezing on N losses from forest soils. This project will determine whether soil freezing in winter negatively affects soil microbes, and whether these effects are direct, via disruption of soil structure and induced physiological stress, or indirect, through effects on plant roots. This research will pair past measurements of soil nitrogen cycling at two winter climate field experiments at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest with new measurements of the abundance and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi using archived soils. Soil, microbial and plant samples from a natural climate gradient will also be used to determine the effects of winter climate on soil nitrogen cycling, plant-microbial interactions, and microbial community composition.","salmon"

Building on baseline data from >40 years of research in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), this team of researchers is uniquely poised to test hypotheses about coral reef resilience to the third strong event to hit this region. Ecological resilience is defined as both the ability of an ecosystem to continue functioning while under stress as well as the ability of a system to ""bounce back"" or restore structure and function following a disturbance. This project is guided by the overarching hypothesis that many ETP coral reefs are becoming more resilient in the face of multiple major ENSO disturbances as a result of adaptive processes. If the investigators are correct that reef systems can develop more tolerance and recover more rapidly when subjected to sequential thermal disturbances, this will drastically change predictions of the fate of global coral reef ecosystems over the next 100 years of climate change. The Broader Impacts of this proposal include mentoring, outreach, and education. To engage a broad audience, all participants will contribute to a project Facebook page, which will be linked to a blogging website where the public can interact with the scientists. <br/><br/>This RAPID funding will provide an unprecedented opportunity to further our understanding of the potential for increased resistance to, and accelerated early recovery from, the third major ENSO to hit the ETP. The investigators have developed hypotheses that can be tested by targeted sampling and experiments in the critical stages before, during and after this ENSO on reefs in Panamï¿½ (Uva, Saboga) and Galï¿½pagos (Darwin Floreana). These reefs span a gradient in aragonite saturation that provides a real-world model system for conditions expected throughout the tropics in a high-CO2 world. Key mechanisms/hypotheses that the investigators will evaluate that may increase resilience, and therefore reduce mortality and limit the loss of ecosystem functioning following this ENSO, include: (1) increases in the relative abundance of thermotolerant symbionts will result in higher survival and faster recovery of multiple coral species across all depths; (2) recovery will be inversely rated to pCO2 with a threshold level beyond which recovery does not occur; (3) the maintenance of strong top-down control by intact herbivore communities will limit algal proliferation, and (4) the strengthening of nutrient-limitation in shallow regions will limit algal competitive abilities and aid coral recovery. At each site where there is a record of recovery the research team will make the following ovservations: (1) in situ measurement of physical parameters (temperature, conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, photosynthetically active radiation, chlorophyll, turbidity, inorganic nutrients); (2) in situ measurement of carbonate chemistry and net ecosystem metabolism (calcification, production); (3) In situ measurements of coral and reef community responses including coral bleaching and mortality and the population responses of corallivores, bioeroders, herbivores, and benthic algal cover; (4) quantification of symbiont communities in major coral species before, during and after the bleaching event to compare with archived samples from the 1997-98 event; (5) bioassays of the strength of top-down (herbivory) and bottom-up (nutrient limitation) effects that may promote ecosystem resilience with critical limits. To further explore these limits, in the southern Galï¿½pagos, where there is a lack of resilience, the investigative team will deploy temperature loggers, conduct surveys of bleaching and mortality of remnant coral communities, and conduct bioassays of the strength of herbivory and nutrient limitation.","lavender"

The funding will alleviate pressure for storage space within this collection located on the Pickle Research Campus of UT. Transfer of specimens from the main campus has stressed the capacity of current storage to critical levels that significantly hinder access and specimen retrieval. Direct user access is vital to ensure that materials remain easily available for on-going and future research, education, and public outreach. This project will address many of these issues. It will facilitate cabinet upgrades, specimen security, and expanded digital access to irreplaceable fossil collections, especially those currently housed without climate control. Specimens include rare historic material, extirpated or extinct species, collections from now inaccessible localities, fossils from the geologic mapping of Texas, thesis and dissertation samples, paleobotanical collections, a unique Holocene marine, land snail and mussel collection, a genotypic mollusc collection, and several orphaned collections. New archival cabinets will provide more efficient space usage, and are a vital step in the progression to fully compacted climate-controlled space when additional funding permits. The physical structure of the cabinets combined with climate curtaining will prevent contamination by pests and pollution, buffer swings in temperature and humidity, and improve security. Public interest and education, furthered through innovative web and mobile applications, will be expanded through a variety of social media. <br/><br/>During the project implementation, most specimens will be passed through a freeze/thaw cycle to kill insects and larvae prior to their transfer to new cabinets. All transfer activity will be tracked via a linked geographic information system (GIS) to a database (Specify6) and web interface; collections will remain digitally accessible during the project by leveraging whole-drawer imagery, which could not be achieved without the previous deployments of an effective GIS and imaging as part of the ongoing inventory process. The project continues an institutional strategy to conserve important collections in the repository and to make high resolution 2-D, and now 3-D, digital surrogates available for collaborative research. All specimens will be imaged in full-drawer context, and individual specimens captured with their historic labels as an added resource. Refinement of the web connectivity between repository map, database, and images will enable remote access for potential teaching specimens and research resources. Virtual specimens and related data will be available for query and download, retaining flexibility to explore these off-site collections in a variety of contexts, including taxonomy, geology, and global paleogeography. Locality coordinates, corrected for plate tectonic movement, will be provided for both spatial and temporal analysis of data. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public.","puce"

Jack Broughton and Joan Coltrain, of the University of Utah, will undertake research to study how variation in the intensity and frequency of El Niï¿½o events in northern Baja California, Mexico over the past 11,000 years influenced marine and terrestrial fish, birds, and mammals. Their research will also investigate how past peoples responded to changes in the availability of different animal resources. This research will provide novel data sets from which to anticipate change in future animal populations under a range of forecasted El Niï¿½o-related variation scenarios and thus support current and future management of marine and terrestrial animals of the eastern Pacific. The project will also reveal how human populations responded to past El Niï¿½o and provide insight into the impact of future El Niï¿½o events on coastal societies in developing countries. <br/><br/>Although the impacts of ancient El Niï¿½o events on past human societies and animals have been documented in specific isolated cases, continuous, high-resolution, millennial-scale records of the impact of El Niï¿½o variation on animal resources and the resulting changes in the human use of North American landscapes have yet to be documented. This project will generate just such a record from a massive collection of animal bones and artifacts that was deposited over the past 11,000 years by people and raptors (hawks, eagles, owls) that occupied a rock shelter site (Abrigo de los Escorpiones) located about 100 m from the Pacific coast of northern Baja California, Mexico. The currently archived animal bone collection includes both marine and terrestrial species and represents one of the largest, well-stratified, continuous, records of climate-based changes in animal populations on the Pacific coast of North America. A rich record of artifacts and features (e.g., fire hearths, marine shell layers) attest to a substantial but intermittent human use of the shelter. The project will determine whether people abandoned the coastal site during periods with high El Niï¿½o frequencies. Such times are characterized by both warm sea-surface temperatures that disrupt marine ecosystems and increased precipitation that enhances the productivity of inland habitats. The study will involve: (1) identification of the animal bones to the species level, (2) radiocarbon dating of a large sample of the bones to establish a time-line and chronology for the deposits, (3) establishing a record of human occupational intensity of the site through artifact counts and evidence of human-caused damage on animal bones (e.g., stone tool cut marks, burning), (4) stable isotope analysis of both bones and shells to provide information on El Niï¿½o variation over the past 11,000 years, and (5) statistical analysis to determine correlations between variation in past El Niï¿½o and change in local animal and human populations.","maroon"

They straddle the boundary between stars and planets - too large to be called planets and too small to be stars. They are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen like stars. Also, their chemical composition often resembles giant gas planets like Jupiter. Studying them presents a great opportunity to learn about atmospheric physics in both stars and planets. This award funds work to study thousands of brown dwarfs using data from public archives. The researchers will update their atmospheric models, and test them with comparisons with their data. Their main database will be the SpeX Prism Spectral Library obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. They will also draw conclusions about atmospheric physics based on a detailed statistical study of these brown dwarfs. The results will also be useful to interpreting observations of extrasolar planets. A graduate student and several undergraduate students will participate in the research, including minorities. The PI will work with the Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS) to increase the numbers of Hispanics and Native Americans in science. <br/><br/>The team will apply Bayesian atmospheric retrieval techniques, widely employed in the extrasolar planet community, to a large sample of brown dwarfs. These tools will be used to determine cloud properties and thermal structures and chemistries across a broad range of temperatures and gravities. In particular, they will address outstanding brown dwarf issues such as the behavior of clouds across the low mass L-T transition, the evolution of disequilibrium chemistry with temperature, and the first measure of the distribution of metallicities and carbon-to-oxygen ratios with the populations. First, they will upgrade their models to include high-temperature opacities and different thermal profiles. Next, they will apply their analysis across the entire SpeX database and explore the relationships between temperature, cloud properties, and molecular abundances and publish results. Ultimately, they will finish retrieval analysis on all SpeX objects and apply to other available datasets for brown dwarfs.","lime"

The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Kristin E. Brzeski is ""How range expansion influences genetic change and disease susceptibility in coyotes."" The host institution is Princeton University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Bridgett vonHoldt.<br/><br/>Understanding how animals adapt during range expansion is critical to predict how they may respond to a changing environment and how to assess and manage their interactions with native species. Assessing how animals, i.e., hosts, and pathogens interact during range expansion is especially important because an animal's basic biology can be shaped by efforts to detect and defeat disease. Coyotes (Canis latrans) are an ideal species to evaluate issues of range expansion because they recently expanded their range eastward in the U.S. and are interacting with native species, such as endangered red wolves, and information is needed on coyote pathogens, which may affect other species. The fellowship research evaluates the genetic and immunological consequences of range expansion. Few studies have evaluated adaptive evolution or host-pathogen dynamics in expanding populations, thus the research promises to provide novel insights into important evolutionary and ecological processes. Specifically, the effects of range expansion are being studied by evaluating 1) coyote genetic variation in their historic and expanded range and 2) host-pathogen dynamics at the coyote expansion front. Genetic and serum samples are provided by the following museums and collections: Denver Museum of Natural Science; Oklahoma Museum of Natural History; Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science; New York State Museum; and the Red Wolf Recovery Programs Archival Data.<br/><br/>Training goals include gaining expertise in genomic and bioinformatics techniques. The fellowship research has value for conservation efforts and wildlife management as coyotes have become highly visible animals and are often considered pests. Thus factors influencing their biology, such as population structure and adaption, are of general interest and can be used to educate the public and inform management actions. This is especially true regarding pathogen data because coyotes and domestic dogs can interact and share diseases, putting pets at risk. Public outreach includes partnerships with conservation organizations and publishing in nontechnical magazines to enhance the public's knowledge of current science discoveries. Educational outreach involves mentoring undergraduate students.","puce"

Equivalent temperature is a metric that considers the total energy content of near-surface air by accounting for both the dry (sensible heat) and moist (latent heat) components. It therefore aligns well with human heat stress, which increases when temperature and humidity are simultaneously elevated. Because equivalent temperature is sensitive to changes in both temperature and humidity, variations in equivalent temperature can reflect processing occurring across a range of scales from global to regional. The objective of this project is to diagnose and attribute historical changes in equivalent temperature to processes occurring at the regional scale (e.g. changes in humidity resulting from soil moisture anomalies), the synoptic scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in the atmospheric circulation), and the global scale (e.g. changes in temperature and humidity associated with changes in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases). The project will investigate these processes within coupled atmosphere ocean general circulation models and regional climate models in the context of developing 21st-century equivalent temperature projections.<br/><br/>This project will address research needs identified in the National Climate Assessment process: to better understand atmospheric responses to atmospheric composition change and to improve understanding of atmospheric changes that may threaten human health and well-being. Equivalent temperature variability has not been previously considered in terms of multiple scales of influence. Attributing variations in equivalent temperature to the underlying processes across the spatial scales at which they act will allow exploration of mechanistic understanding of equivalent temperature tendencies in the historical record. Downscaling atmosphere ocean general circulation models using statistical and dynamical approaches with knowledge of the driving processes will allow the researchers to develop the best available projections of future equivalent temperature output and to contextualize those projections within a rigorous understanding of drivers of historical change. The results of the project will have broad implications for climate change adaptation and planning, because changes in equivalent temperature and its components may be critical for both human health and agriculture this century. Project results will be institutionally archived and made available to the research community. The project provides support for multiple graduate students at each institution, and thus contributes to development of the next generation of geographers and atmospheric scientists.","maroon"

A key species in this ecosystem is Antarctic krill, which in addition to being commercially harvested, is the principle prey of a wide range of marine organisms including penguins, seals and whales. The aim of this study is to use penguins and other krill predators as sensitive indicators of past changes in the Antarctic marine food web resulting from climate variability and the historic harvesting of seals and whales by humans. Specifically this study will recover and analyze modern (<20 year old), historic (20-200 year old) and ancient (200-10,000 year old) penguin and other krill predator tissues to track their past diets and population movements relative to shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill. The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry. In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.<br/><br/>This research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting. This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene. This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill.","plum"

Despite a large body of research studying the effects of incarceration, relatively few studies have analyzed in detail the process of leaving prison and entering a community. In this context, this project extends prior research by offering innovative new analyses of data and the creation of publicly available data files from the Boston Reentry Study (BRS), a longitudinal study of 122 Massachusetts state prisoners newly-released to the Boston area that yielded an unparalleled response rate of 94 percent through 4 waves of follow-up in the year after prison release. The current project will thus provide a unique data set, including rich quantitative and qualitative information for the analysis of community return for a sample of newly-released prisoners under contemporary conditions of mass incarceration. The current project---including new analysis and data dissemination---will greatly expand the scope of the study's influence by informing policy debates on programs for transitional employment after prison, social supports for families that do much of the caring work immediately after incarceration, and for recidivism reduction, identifying key vulnerabilities in the year after prison release. The research will also play an important role in the academic development of students with interests in poverty and incarceration by involving them in the analysis of data and preparation of papers. <br/><br/>The current project will broaden understanding of the connection of a highly marginal population to mainstream social institutions, allowing in particular new analyses of family relationships, employment, and recidivism. The project comprises two main parts. First, new data analysis will capitalize on a variety of unique features of the BRS data. Income data are available monthly and include measures of wages, public assistance, support from families and illegal earnings. Data on families and children includes all sources of family support including the parents of released prisoners, and all children, allowing a complete mapping of multiple partner fertility. The analysis of recidivism will combine quantitative criminal record information with qualitative accounts including re-incarceration interviews yielding a new understanding of the social process of returning to custody, particularly for those who are relapsing to addiction or violating the conditions of community supervision. Second, archival work on the BRS will involve the preparation of a public-use data set, restricted-use data files including criminal records and other sensitive data, and qualitative materials including interview transcripts or audio tapes. The dissemination of these data will allow a wide variety of analyses of the process of social integration after incarceration, will promote mixed methods research that combines statistical analysis with the interpretative analysis of recorded and transcribed interviews and will contribute a unique public good to the community of scholars working on the problems of incarceration and poverty.","crimson"

The long-term, publicly accessible database that continues to be acquired and archived provides an irreplaceable resource for scientists, policy makers, and the general public. The use of the data in the development of exhibits and learning programs at TERC's two public education centers in the Tahoe basin ensures that investments in science are being used to both educate and inspire school children and the general public about science, ecosystem stewardship and our threatened freshwater resources. Details of the research, monitoring and educational programs are available at terc.ucdavis.edu.<br/><br/>The primary goal for the use of both items of equipment is to maintain and extend the long-term ecosystem record for Lake Tahoe by allowing for stable and accurate measurements to be taken with new instruments. Secondarily, the equipment can be used in a broad range of Sierra Nevada and other lakes in the region. The instruments are ideal for use in a broad range of clear, low concentration Sierra Nevada lakes. The long path-length spectrophotometer permits new areas of research to be explored through high accuracy Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) calibrations from the spectral response of field samples. The profiling water quality sensor package (Seabird CTD) enables year-round profiling to be maintained in multiple lakes. The instruments will permit an expansion of research on CDOM and density stratification impacts in high mountain lakes. Current research is highlighting the role of CDOM both as an indicator of change and as a driver of change in aquatic ecosystems. CDOM data are urgently needed to calibrate models investigating the potential impacts of global change on ecosystem health in the next 100 years.

Changes include the restructuring of food systems so that local farming economies are increasingly tied to global networks and processes. One somewhat surprising response on the part of local food producers has been the rise of binational family-based farming enterprises, which, despite being small to midscale ventures, successfully coordinate across state lines to facilitate vertically integrated operations, mitigate inequities, and access produce markets. The research supported by this award will investigate how this occurs: how do local family fruit and vegetable producers utilize global networks, coordinate transregional projects, and contribute to food system circulations? And what role do traditional modes of organizing family farms, such as kinship networks, play in contemporary farming operations? The research will be carried out by University of Kentucky doctoral student Mary Elizabeth W. Schmid, with direction from anthropologist Dr. Ann E. Kingsolver, in the western North Carolina region of southern Appalachia, with comparative research in other southeastern U.S. states and Mexico. <br/><br/>Schmid will document family and enterprise histories, provisioning strategies, forms of relatedness, cultural practices, and decision-making processes to determine how members draw on family and non-family relations to enable strategic production, distribution, and marketing coordination across time and space. Her mixed methods approach will include archival research, participant observation, interviewing, social network analysis, ethnographic mapping, and qualitative analysis of textual data. She will map family and enterprise networks, temporal cycles, transnational kinship circuit flows, and the social organization of fruit and vegetable production and marketing. Findings from this research will contribute to understanding the functioning of small to midscale fruit and vegetable production enterprises in the contemporary economy and the social and economic effects of agricultural policies intended to regulate this sector.","maroon"

These issues include (1) three-dimensional bridge geometries such as deck shape, skew and embankments, whose hydraulic characteristics can lead to channelization, bore entrapment, and shielding; (2) debris impact and debris damming that can greatly increase the forces on a bridge, both during the initial impact of the tsunami waves and during the outflows; and (3) fluid-structure interaction effects that can be significant for particular types of bridges and retrofit strategies, such as the deployment of fenders or in cases with flexible structures. Bridge-specific retrofit strategies will also be explored. Recent advances in the development of parallel processing software and the availability of powerful computational platforms make it possible to simulate these complex effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling will address the effects of three-dimensional hydraulic geometries. The Material Point Method (MPM) will address the effects of debris impact fields and damming by modeling debris explicitly. The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), as implemented in OpenSees, will allow researchers to consider the fluid-structure interaction, the effects of the preceding earthquake shaking and the effect of uncertainties. As part of this planning grant, the simulation strategies will be developed sufficiently to guide the detailed design of critical experiments in a NEES2 facility early in FY2015. <br/><br/>Over the past decade, tsunamis have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage. The loss of critical lifeline structures has exacerbated these catastrophes by delaying emergency response efforts and post-event economic recovery. Large tsunamis also threaten at least five U.S. states and numerous U.S. territories. Nearly all past tsunami research has focused on run-up modeling, the development of evacuation strategies, and more recently, on the design of buildings to resist tsunamis. In comparison, little research has addressed the tsunami performance of bridges, and no guidelines are available to design safe and economical tsunami-resistant bridges or to develop retrofit strategies. To these ends, the proposed research will transform the design of tsunami-resistant bridges, and consequently, greatly improve post-event response and recovery efforts. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.

The project takes advantage of the fact that the stars in a triple-star system are at the same distance from us, which makes it possible to determine their relative sizes. Follow-up spectroscopy of the stars' radial velocities and detailed modeling is used to determine absolute radii. Triple-star systems have very complicated motion, which changes their apparent brightness over time. The team will model these data to determine the internal mass distributions. They will train graduate students working on Master's degrees and undergraduate students working on senior thesis projects. The investigators will also incorporate research results into their college courses and public lectures. <br/><br/>The work will be completed by examining, for the first time, the apsidal motion of three-body eclipsing binaries for stars less massive than the Sun. The rate of apsidal precession is related to the mass distribution inside the stars, which the team will model. They will use archival NASA Kepler mission lightcurves (photometric time series) and photo-dynamical computer models to measure the apsidal motion constants, which are directly related to the distribution and concentration of mass inside a star. The constants will be determined by modeling the changes in orbital period of the stars. They will use spectroscopy obtained at multiple ground-based telescopes to measure the radial velocities and determine the standard stellar photospheric characteristics, such as effective temperature, metallicity, surface gravity and rotational velocity.

The main point of contention concerned the degree to which the corporation should be considered as similar to a person; a natural entity with rights that could be separated from those of the corporation's owners. By the end of the 1920s, the debate had largely dissipated with the ascendance of a ""realist"" view that cast legal terms as largely empty signifiers. In recent years, corporate personhood has once again become a topic of public debate. Recently the Supreme Court re-visited the question of the proper scope for corporate rights: when and upon what basis should corporate entities engage in political speech and enjoy protections that citizens enjoy. The questions this research address are, what role (if any) did the legacy of the legal doctrine of corporate personhood play answering these questions, and in crafting American corporate regulation more broadly? And why has corporate personhood come to play this role in American law?<br/><br/>To address these questions, the researchers undertake a mixed-method approach to analyze the development of corporate personhood law between 1886-2014. First, the researchers trace the historical development of the personhood doctrine through the web of legal citations. This allows them to identity the periods, cases, courts, and legal arenas where the personhood doctrine was deployed. Second, the researchers use a comparative historical analysis between the United States and England to explain why the doctrine of corporate personhood was especially appealing to American jurists. The researchers use archival material to assess the relative influence of economic, political, institutional, and cultural drivers of legal development. The overall goal of the project is to develop a cultural theory of the development of corporate law.","crimson"

The American Southwest (here defined as Arizona, southern Utah, and southern Nevada) appears to be mostly inactive tectonically. However, there is evidence that large earthquakes have occurred here in recent geologic times. We explore the possibility that the amount of crustal deformation in this area (and thus can generate (large) earthquakes) varies with time and is modulated by large earthquakes in southern California and Gulf of California. We have seen evidence for this by using GPS observations of the deformation pattern before and after the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (M7.2). We will combine ongoing GPS measurements with different modeling tools to characterize and model the source of the time-variable and long-term deformation, which we aim to separate. The time-variable deformation can be understood as visco-elastic deformation in the lithosphere following large (far-field) earthquakes. The long-term deformation can likely be modeled by considering the proper ratio of the far-field stresses imposed by Pacific plate motion and stresses due to lateral variation in crustal thickness and density in our study area. <br/><br/>This is a follow-on proposal that extends our current EarthScope project on the Colorado Plateau area. Over the last five years, the long-term kinematics as measured by GPS are obscured by postseismic deformation from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, which occurred 3 months before we installed a new 34-station continuous network. As a result, important questions on the role of Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) variations in driving deformation, the reasons for the dearth of active faults and seismicity in southern Arizona, and the reach of plate motion stresses remain unanswered. In order to address these questions, and simultaneously further our understanding of the postseismic process, we propose a three-tiered approach: 1) extend existing GPS time-series to improve characterization of transient deformation, 2) use those data to explore the crustal and mantle viscosities required to match the GPS time-series data, and 3) create physical models of the long-term expected deformation, that includes the latest GPE estimates, to explain the residual motions after correction for postseismic effects. We will also leverage GPS data from other NSF funded projects, as well as seismic data products obtained by USArray that have helped to constrain crustal and lithospheric thickness structure and stress orientations. Geodetic strain rates could potentially be used as an independent constraint on the regional seismic hazard, but only after we have corrected it for all post-seismic effects, and assessed the long-term drivers of crustal motion. We will employ a female graduate student at UNR to work on the project. We will also engage a RESESS undergraduate intern during the summer of the second year. The goal of the RESESS program is to increase diversity in the Geosciences work force. We will recruit one student from the UA Disability Resource Center (DRC) to conduct a small research project associated with the larger goals of the overall project. We will also lead an accessible field trip to the Grand Canyon for students registered at the DRC in a program that we developed and implemented in September 2015. The goal of these activities is to draw attention to the numerous research opportunities made available by the large volume of data in NSF and other national data archives, available to a wide range of individuals. Finally, we plan to give outreach talks at the area's parks and monuments.","hot_pink"

The investigators will target seven rivers for sampling. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but will emphasize sample collection during the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The data will be synthesized and interpreted using mixing models and regression analyses, and compared with data for the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers, which have historically been considered ""typical"" for North American runoff to the Arctic. Acceleration of glacial melt and the hydrologic cycle in a warmer world will likely increase local inputs of freshwater to the CAA. Because many such changes may already be underway, it is important to establish a baseline by which future changes can be compared. The proposed research has implications regarding the variability and magnitude of freshwater export from the Arctic and subarctic oceans to the North Atlantic, and the findings will help fill significant gaps in the knowledge of CAA river geochemistry and the Arctic freshwater cycle. The project will catalyze a new partnership among faculty, researchers, and students at the Applied Physics Laboratory and Northwestern University. Moreover, the research will include hands-on participation from local community members who will collect samples during various times of year to extend the temporal coverage of the study. Data will be made publicly available via websites and databases for maximum visibility, dispersion, and long-term archival. Additional activities include teaching and training of a postdoctoral student, incorporation of project findings into curricular materials, and outreach to K-12 students from traditionally underrepresented groups.","plum"

These cores provide a unique high-latitude sedimentary record of both marine and terrestrial systems and thus the demand for the samples from the scientific community is expected to be very high. Before these cores are irreversibly cut up and sampled, Principal Investigators request support to acquire non-intrusive CT-scans of high-priority, high-resolution sections in selected cores to optimize utilization of these sediments for achieving the scientific objectives of the expedition. This requires rapid action before the main core sampling occurs (mid-Nov. 2013) to insure that the material is correctly sampled and that disturbed intervals or critical laminae that are not obvious to the eye in these complex ice-proximal sediments are not sampled. To accomplish the work in time to guide the main sampling work, Principal Investigators propose to use CT scanners at the Oregon State University College of Veterinary Medicine (adjacent to the OSU Core Repository) and the at the Institut National de Recherchï¿½ Scientifique, Centre Eau, Terre et Environnement (INRS-ETE) in Quebec City, Canada.

Principal Investigators expect that these CT-scans will provide a legacy dataset used by the larger scientific community long into the future. In addition, the extraordinary visualizations provided by these data will provide opportunities for public education and outreach for IODP and geosciences.

The 0.1 to 10 THz frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum is where electrical transport and optical transitions merge, thus offering exciting opportunities to study a variety of novel physical phenomena. By combining THz technology and nanotechnology, we can advance our understanding of THz physics while improving and developing THz devices. Nanotechnology is the study of nanostructures (between 1 to 100 nanometers long) and how they can be controlled, fabricated, or manipulated. New discoveries provide insight into the possibilities for novel electronic, photonic, mechanical, and magnetic devices that have huge potential for future technological applications including medicine, computation, and communications.<br/><br/>This PIRE project will (a) advance our quantitative understanding of THz dynamics in nanostructures, (b) fabricate novel nanostructures for THz study and applications, (c) advance cutting-edge experimental techniques in THz spectroscopy and imaging, and (d) provide new knowledge useful for developing novel THz devices. The projects explore THz dynamics in carbon nanomaterials, namely, nanotubes and graphene.<br/><br/>The U.S. and Japan are global leaders in both THz research and nanotechnology, and stimulating cooperation is critical to further advance THz science and develop commercial products from new ideas in the lab. However, obstacles exist for international collaboration - primarily linguistic and cultural barriers - and this PIRE project aims to continue breaking down these barriers. The project will also leverage large investments by both countries to achieve long-term scientific and societal impact by providing future generations of researchers with a better understanding of both the culture and the state-of-the-art technology in each country.<br/><br/>The strong educational portfolio of this project focuses on cultivating interest in nanotechnology among young U.S. undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, and encouraging such students to pursue graduate study and academic research in the physical sciences. This renewed funding will expand and strengthen the award-winning international research experience program for undergraduates called the NanoJapan Program. Recognized as a model for international education programs for science and engineering students, this program will provide U.S. undergraduates with structured research opportunities in Japanese university laboratories with Japanese mentors. This program includes a three-week orientation program with language and culture training as well as extensive use of information technologies as learning and community-building tools. U.S. graduate students, early career scientists, researchers and alumni will benefit from direct involvement in the PIRE research as well as from related follow-on educational projects at home institutions and in local communities. Other programs such as undergraduate and graduate research assistantships and the NanoAsia Graduate International Research Experience (IRE) are additional venues for international collaboration for U.S. students. The original PIRE had particular success with recruitment of females and African-American students; these recruitment efforts will continue and will be expanded to include first-generation college-attending students. This broad portfolio of PIRE educational activities should produce a diverse cadre of students with rich skill sets that span nanoscience specialties, international cultural awareness, and the intersection of culture, language, science, and technology.<br/><br/>Institutional impacts of this award include strengthening Rice University's leadership position in international research and education in THz science, materials science, and nanoscience. It places Rice at the hub of an exciting domestic and international collaborative network of researchers and educators, while leveraging the University of Tulsa's exceptional strength in international education, especially its expertise in developing international education programs for science and engineering students. An Introduction to Nanotechnology & Nanoscience Online Seminar will be developed within this PIRE and will be webcast live and archived online, enabling live or asynchronous participation of all U.S. and Japanese participants, thus enhancing the international curriculum at all institutions. In addition, the project will further strengthen and internationalize connections within and among campuses established through the original PIRE award, including those with international offices, IT units, and curriculum and assessment specialists. The project is also an innovative model that enables the participating universities to foster multi-disciplinary international collaboration among scholars in engineering, the sciences, and the humanities. Furthermore, by bringing undergraduates into international research, the project builds on the success of the original PIRE in strengthening the pool of potential globally-engaged graduate students for the PIRE institutions and the nation.<br/><br/>U.S. project partners include Rice University (TX), University of Florida, University of Tulsa (OK), State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and Texas A&M University.

Using archival research, comparative-historical analysis, interviews, and quantitative analysis, this project analyzes the mechanisms, actors, and pathways by which human rights and sustainability goals might be fulfilled. Three megacities were chosen as the sites for analysis because of the extreme governance challenges they face due to the confluence of rapid urbanization, illegal housing, migration, poverty, inequality, and water scarcity. All of these factors fundamentally affect public health, social equity, and the environment. Research objectives include documenting and evaluating the role of legal and non-legal mechanisms in realizing human rights and sustainability norms for water and sanitation; evaluating the role of state and non-state actors in implementing social rights; and identifying and comparatively analyzing configurations of mechanisms and pathways across research sites and sectors to see when and how they operate more or less effectively. An important outcome will be the identification of practical strategies for making social rights real in places where it is difficult to do so. <br/><br/>The policy significance of rights to natural resources gives the project substantial broader impacts. Findings will be made available to respondents as well as to international development agencies via a web portal and in-country presentations.

While lenders may take courts for granted as rubber stamps for repossessions, judges and registrars may hesitate to repossess homes. Exploring emerging practices and theories of law and economy in the context of property repossessions, the research asks how formal legal institutions and players define property, property rights, and legal responsibility. The project also examines lay understandings of property, asking how homeowners and business owners define property and respond to repossessions. In addition to advancing knowledge on the interplay between law, markets, courts, and the economy, this project has broader impacts that include graduate student training.<br/><br/>The rural Irish border region serves as the site for the research project.

The research will use ethnographic field methods of participant observation, direct observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival research to analyze how the economic recovery practically unwinds at the local level and in the context of bureaucratic registration, court proceedings, and actual repossessions.","crimson"

Examples of such motions range from performing daily activities to breathing and heartbeat during sleep. These various scales of motions can be captured by fine-grained WiFi signals to perform continuous wellbeing monitoring. Wellbeing monitoring leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure is particularly attractive as it requires neither wearing body instrumentation nor active monitorng by the user. Such an approach would facilitate a broad range of healthcare related applications at home environments without frequent hospital visits, such as real-time prediction and prevention of certain health problems (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and sleep apnea). Using existing WiFi infrastructure for wellbeing monitoring not only advances and extends the applications that could be supported by WiFi networks but also enables easy and large-scale deployment in non-clinical settings due to the proliferation of WiFi networks. Additionally, the educational efforts include curriculum development, outreaching to high school students, and engaging both undergraduate and graduate students in research.<br/><br/>This project focuses on building a WiFi enabled continuous wellbeing monitoring framework for fine-grained sleep monitoring and vital signs tracking at home environments.

The proposed framework develops device-free localization strategies, vital signs tracking methods and statistical learning techniques to depict a comprehensive picture of users' wellbeing. Such wellbeing information is further utilized to assist in real-time disease prediction by leveraging today's ever-growing mobile environments. A hierarchical multivariate logistic regression model is developed to effectively mine through health conditions and identify risk factors of certain diseases. Chances of developing certain health problems, such as cardiovascular diseases, is promptly predicted. The project also provides user-centric access control of archived wellbeing monitoring information to ensure data privacy and coping with distrusted servers.","olive"

This work will marshal data associated with debris removal following a recent large-scale tornado storm in Alabama to investigate these phenomena. This work is expected to benefit society by contributing to its ability to plan for and respond to large-scale disasters, particularly by improving understanding of the determinants of debris removal performance. In particular, it should develop models and lessens that will speed up the recovery process and make communities more resilient to disaster impacts. It will advance discovery while promoting learning by developing educational materials which will be integrated into undergraduate- and graduate-level course work, as well as into materials for practicing professionals. It will broaden participation of under-represented groups through their inclusion in the research team and enhance research infrastructure through the creation of data sets and analytic tools for use by other researchers.

Although violations of rights by the state may be rampant, citizens are reluctant to challenge the state, fearing they might be targeted for persecution. Lawyers tend to be similarly cowed. This project asks whether this might be changing. Focusing on the case of Russia, the project explores how lawyers think about themselves and their role in society through a random sample of 2500 recent law graduates. Russia presents an intriguing case because the number of young people studying law exploded just as the Putin regime stepped up its curtailment of the exercise of civil rights. The survey will reveal how graduates are dispersing themselves among various types of lawyering and their attitudes towards their obligations toward clients, with particular attention to the responsibility of lawyers to support clients who want to challenge the state or other powerful actors. The results promise to provide a window into the capacity of the Russian legal profession to spur the development of civil society. The results of the survey, which will be the first to include all types of Russian lawyers, will be archived and available to other researchers for analysis. <br/><br/>The project uses mixed methods to map the Russian legal profession and investigate its political significance. The fractured nature of this group makes a survey of practicing lawyers impossible. The Principal Investigator, working in collaboration with Russian consultants based at the Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, plans a panel survey of a single cohort of law school graduates. They will construct a sample of approximately 2500 law students (recipients of both bachelors and masters degrees) on the cusp of graduation in 2016, stratified by region and institutional prestige. The PI plans to return to this same group of respondents at regular 5-year intervals (though this proposal seeks funding for the first round). Among the questions that the PI will be able to answer are: how do graduates disperse among the various subgroups of the profession; and to what extent are some demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, ethnicity, religion, class) preferenced by the different subgroups of the profession in getting a job and moving up the ladder of success. As a supplement to the survey, the PI will conduct 120 follow-up interviews with respondents culled from the surveyed population with an eye to diversity in career path as well as demographic factors. These interviews will build on the survey and will be conducted in 2017. They will be concentrated in 3 regions: Moscow, Saratov, and Tomsk. The interviews will be transcribed and analyzed by the PI using NVIVO. As with the survey, future plans call for re-interviewing this same cohort of 120 respondents at regular intervals.","crimson"

An additional intellectual merit of this sharing of experience is the latent faculty development that occurs as the non-expert facilitators gain experience in the content delivered by the distant experts. Simultaneously, the community is developing experience in and appreciation of new digital learning modalities that are increasingly comfortable to the new generation of 'free-agent learners'.<br/><br/>The OLCC is leading to the development of modules and digital Teaching and Learning Objects that are coded with meta data, retrievable via national and international archival mechanisms, and which can be repurposed and distributed into other curricular environments.

Their shells are composed of calcium carbonate and the oxygen isotopic composition of their shells record climatic conditions during growth. Therefore, the oxygen isotopic composition of land snails has the potential to reconstruct past climates on broad spatial and temporal scales. To date, however, there is a little understanding on the kinds of climatic information that can be inferred from the snails, and therefore, their current use as paleoclimatic archives is limited. This proposal will develop, test, and calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of small land snails for use as a paleoclimatic proxy in terrestrial settings across North America. The modern calibration of this proxy will benefit society through the development of a terrestrial paleoclimatic proxy that is capable of reconstructing past climate over broad spatial and temporal scales and also will improve our understanding of the taxonomic diversity and spatial distribution of land snails, a fauna that is decreasing at an alarming rate globally. This project will teach and train future scientists, from high school to PhD candidates, integrate scientists from multiple fields (paleontology, biology, Quaternary geology), and broaden the participation of diverse and underrepresented groups. Dissemination of results will include a diverse audience (specialists and general public), in English and Spanish to reach the Hispanic community in USA and elsewhere. This project will establish linkages between underrepresented groups and STEM disciplines at research-intensive universities. <br/><br/>To calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of modern land snails in North America, investigators will analyze the oxygen isotope composition of approximately 1,000 shell samples from modern snails collected along two selected transects that cross North America from southern Texas to Canada. They will identify the primary climatic controls on shell ï¿½18O values by quantifying the relation between shell ï¿½18O and relevant climatic variables (temperature, ï¿½18O of precipitation, precipitation amount, relative humidity) using an evaporative steady-state flux balance-mixing model developed for land snails. Researchers hypothesize that: (1) the oxygen isotope composition of small land snails in temperate environments (latitudes of 26 to 48 degrees N) primarily will reflect the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation, and therefore can be used to infer past changes in precipitation oxygen isotope values; and (2) shell oxygen isotope values of snails living in arid to semi-arid environments will yield higher values than predicted because of low relative humidity values. After calibration of the oxygen isotope systematics for living specimens, investigators will conduct two case studies to determine how well the oxygen isotope values of small snails track the oxygen isotope records of speleothems or other proxy records. The proposed work will allow better quantification of past climate change over broad areas of North America, and from many different types of deposits.","hot_pink"

This project will have the potential to make significant societal impact through the development of a software prototype for data curation and integration. Such a prototype will enable the users to construct robust, application-specific, consistent views of temporal data on demand, which will lead to new classes of applications, particularly those involving profiling, tracking, monitoring, archiving and understanding of the evolution of entities over time. This project will also provide the opportunity to train students in several critical research areas central to temporal databases, data analytics and big data. The results obtained in this investigation will be incorporated into advanced graduate courses on large-scale data integration offered at both SUNY at Buffalo and UC Santa Cruz. The software artifacts and datasets produced will be made freely available for broad dissemination and sharing.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state-of-the-art in data curation and integration over temporal data through addressing three fundamental challenges. First, unlike incompleteness in non-temporal data, incompleteness in temporal data may be time-varying. Time-varying incompleteness will necessitate the introduction of time-dependent nulls. The second challenge is that inconsistency can also occur in temporal data. Inconsistency will be handled by declaratively specifying temporal preferences and algorithms to resolve conflicts based on those preferences. Alternatively, under the assumption that the inconsistent temporal database is left as is, this project will consider how consistent query answers can be computed over such a database. This project will also consider, for the first time, data with both incompleteness and inconsistency in a single formal framework, which will require significant conceptual and practical advances. The third challenge is to achieve temporal data independence through a conceptual framework that will use a formal, two-tier approach to manage temporal data; the abstract view provides the semantics and the concrete view for the physical representation of temporal data. The views hide lower-level details and allow for declarative, logical specification of queries, mappings, and dependencies.

One of the most critical conditions to shape the development of life is the composition of Earth's atmosphere. Unlike today's atmosphere, which is approximately 20% oxygen, the atmosphere of the ancient Earth had no oxygen. A major transition in the development of early life has been strongly linked to the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere which began 2.5 - 3 billion years ago, ultimately leading to the biological complexity on our planet today. To better understand the connection of atmospheric oxygen to the development of ancient life, it is important to know how much oxygen was present, particularly in the shallow oceans which served as the cradle of early life. To measure oxygen content in ancient oceans, this research team is developing a method to use a chemical tracer, or fingerprint of oxygen recorded in limestones, analogous to forensic scientists who develop methods to find evidence at a crime scene.<br/><br/>Preliminary data has indicated that the presence of the element iodine (the same substance used as an antiseptic on wounds) in limestones is strongly correlated to the presence of oxygen in Earth's history. However, to reliably determine oxygen concentrations in the ancient atmosphere using iodine as a tracer, it is necessary to understand what factors influence the iodine content of limestones that form in the ocean. The research team in this study will focus on that question with this work by studying the chemistry of iodine in modern and near-modern marine muds and incipient rocks. This work will provide valuable information on iodine chemistry in the modern world, as well as refining and calibrating iodine content as a tracer of ancient oxygen. A new means to fingerprint ancient oxygen has implications for understanding the development of life in ancient times.<br/><br/>Not only can this work potentially contribute to understanding how modern life came to exist, it also has a number of educational impacts. A new collaboration will be initiated between an early-career assistant professor, Zunli Lu (Syracuse University) and senior professor Tim Lyons (University of California Riverside). The project will contribute to building the future US STEM-trained workforce via the training of two graduate students and undergraduates from the diverse campus of UCR. Additionally, the research team plans significant outreach for younger students by working with the new Riverside STEM academy and science fair mentoring. <br/><br/><br/>Technical description.<br/><br/>The shallow waters of the Precambrian ocean were home to the first oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms as well as many of the milestones of early evolution, such as the rise of eukaryotes and ultimately animals. Reliable measurements of the redox conditions in the Precambrian surface ocean are key to understanding the evolution of life during this critical transitional period in Earth's history. Currently, knowledge of oxygen levels in these surface waters is limited. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by developing a promising new proxy, namely using iodine-to-calcium ratios (I/Ca) in limestones and dolostones. This iodine method is based upon two observations: (1) the oxidized iodine species iodate exists exclusively in well-oxygenated water and (2) iodate is the only iodine species incorporated during carbonate precipitation.<br/><br/>The research team will conduct the first systematic evaluation of uptake and diagenetic overprints for I/Ca in classic modern/near-modern shallow marine carbonate settings. These plans include tracking diagenesis from shallow to deep burial in South Florida and the Bahamas using independently well constrained samples spanning diverse diagenetic settings and processes ranging from early organic remineralization to meteoric and marine burial conditions to dolomitization.<br/><br/>These carbonate analyses will be complemented with a novel study of iodine uptake and retention in modern organic-rich, shale precursor facies. Assimilation into organic matter represents the largest iodine sink in the modern ocean, and remineralization of this sink and export back to the overlying water column is the largest marine input. Because organic matter mostly assimilates the reduced iodine species, iodide, ratios of I-to-TOC (total organic carbon) in shales paired with carbonate I/Ca should allow for the discrimination of I/Ca trends (or portions of trends) reflecting local redox shifts versus broader reservoir controls. In other words, the proxy, as applied to very old samples, will be taken beyond simple presence-absence scenarios toward questions of global conditions through a quantitative understanding of iodine?s ocean-scale mass balance. Previous studies have noted redox-controlled variations in local I/TOC ratios in modern environments, thus complicating this relationship and its relevance to I/Ca ratios in ancient carbonates. In response, the team will assess iodine uptake and preservation in organic-rich sediments across redox gradients in two classic modern anoxic settings, the Black Sea and the Cariaco Basin. Ultimately, the research team plans to cross-calibrate I/TOC ratios against other diverse and already well-understood proxies for depositional oxygen conditions as archived in black shales and, in the process, to highlight the necessity for a multi-proxy approach to reconstructing the environmental backdrop of Earth's earliest life.","hot_pink"

Among many types of cancers, ovarian cancer is a particularly severe disease because it usually does not present many symptoms and when it does, it is usually too late. Ovarian cancer, like many other cancers, can theoretically be detected by sensing certain molecules in the blood sample of a patient. There are a number of such 'molecular markers' that could be measured. However, most current platforms are not sensitive enough to detect most of these markers in blood. Those that are sensitive are highly complicated, unreliable and expensive. This particular study aims to develop biomolecular detector that is very sensitive, low cost and capable to performing multiple tests at the same time very quickly. The prosed platform will have the capability of analyzing how a cancer patient responds to therapy using a minimally invasive blood test. Since these tests are relatively simple and cheap as compared to computed tomography scans and biopsies, the tests can be performed more frequently and help clinicians quickly see how the patient is responding to therapy and if necessary, increase the dosage, modify or stop the therapy. In addition, the platform paves the way to early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and can be adapted to many other cancers. The proposed study also includes educational activities that will teach high school students about diffraction and optical phenomenon that enables the operation of the proposed platform. <br/><br/>The proposed platform integrates three elements: a) immunomagnetic bead-based separation that concentrates small number of molecules onto a functionalized biochip surface by capturing rare molecules from large sample volumes, b) optical diffractometry to detect signals generated by self-assembled bead gratings, and c) high-speed spinning disk interferometry that interrogates multiple chips for fast and highly sensitive multiplexing. The study involves building the system, optimizing its performance via simulations and experimentation, and testing with three molecular markers of the ovarian cancer (vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, basic-fibroblast growth factor) that are generally difficult to detect using today's technology and hence have not been extensively studied in the context of ovarian cancer. The proposed system will detect these markers from the blood samples of ovarian cancer patients at sub-picomolar concentrations and most importantly, detect all of them at the same time. Unlike most current biosensing platforms that usually have one main strength but a lot of shortcomings, the proposed biomolecular detector system will have the capability of high throughput, high sensitivity, robustness, archivability of the detection chips for future analysis, without the need for fluorescence or microscopy.","wheat"

The lessons this research produces can be of value in deepening understanding of similar situations, especially in economies where agriculture is irrigation-dependent and where water access is stressed between the demands of a large urban population and the demands of an extensive irrigation-dependent agricultural sector.<br/><br/>Maira Hayat, under the supervision of Dr. William Mazzarella of the University of Chicago, will explore water governance focusing on two locales: the drinking water market in an urban setting, and the public canal irrigation network in a village context. The research will take place in Pakistan, home to the world's largest contiguous irrigation network fed by the river Indus and its tributaries. Concentrated in the Punjab province, this network has roots in 19th century colonial policies aiming, in parallel, at increasing tax revenue from agricultural production, and 'settling' the region by converting the predominantly nomadic locals to sedentary agriculturalists. This research will deepen understanding of the relation between law and political economy; bureaucracies, markets and the intersection of knowledge and value regimes; and resource governance worldwide. It will contribute to analyses of law and economic life through charting the relation between economy and sovereignty, and contemporary water governance. This research will further understanding of the successes and failures of public irrigation, and enable policymakers to design better-informed policy, and help make policy less top-down at a time of extensive water-sector reform in many water-stressed contexts.

To extract valuable information from this network of cameras, complex computer programs are needed to retrieve data from the geographically distributed cameras and to analyze the data. This project creates a open source software infrastructure by solving many problems common to different types of analysis programs. By using this infrastructure, researchers can focus on scientific discovery, not writing computer programs. This project can improve efficiency and thus reduce the cost for running programs analyzing large amounts of data. This infrastructure promotes education because students can obtain an instantaneous view of the network cameras and use the visual information to understand the world. Better understanding of the world may encourage innovative solutions for many pressing issues, such as better urban planning and lower air pollution. This project can enhance diversity through multiple established programs that encourage underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in science and engineering. <br/><br/>This project will combine: (1) the ability to retrieve data from many heterogeneous and distributed cameras, (2) the management of computational and storage resources using cloud computing, and (3) improved performance by reducing data movement, balancing loads among multiple cloud instances, and enhancing data-level parallelism. The project provides an application programming interface (API) that hides the underlying sophisticated infrastructure. This infrastructure will handle both real-time streaming data and archival data in a uniform way, so that the same analysis programs can be reused. This project has four major components: (1) a web-based user interface, (2) a database that stores the details about the network cameras, (3) a resource manager that allocates cloud instances, and (4) a computational engine that execute the programs written by users.

The Drake Passage XBT/XCTD transect time series now extends back to 1996, and continues to add to a number of quantitative estimates of the long term trends in Southern Ocean fronts, surface water mass properties, their response to atmospheric forcing on climate relevant time scales. This proposal also seeks renewal of a near decadal time series effort measuring the underway surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in regular transects across the Drake Passage.","plum"

While the hearing population has benefited from advances in speech technologies such as speech recognition and spoken web search, much less progress has been made for sign language interfaces. Advances depend on improved technology for analyzing sign language from video. In addition, the linguistics of sign language is less well-understood than that of spoken language. This project addresses both of these needs, with an interdisciplinary approach that will contribute to research in linguistics, language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Applications of the work include better access to ASL social media video archives, interactive recognition and search applications for Deaf individuals, and ASL-English interpretation assistance.<br/><br/>This project focuses on handshape in ASL, in particular on one constrained but very practical component: fingerspelling, or the spelling out of a word as a sequence of handshapes and trajectories between them. Fingerspelling comprises up to 35% of ASL, depending on the context, and includes 72% of ASL handshapes, making it an excellent testing ground. The project addresses gaps in existing work by focusing on handshape in various conditions, including fast, highly coarticulated signing. The main project activities include development of (1) robust automatic detection and recognition of fingerspelled words using new handshape models, including segmental and ""multi-segmental"" graphical models of ASL phonological features; (2) techniques for generalizing across signers, styles, and recording conditions; (3) improved phonetics and phonology of handshape, in particular contributing to an articulatory phonology of sign; and (4) publicly released multi-speaker, multi-style fingerspelling data and associated semi-automatic annotation.","indigo"

As part of its educational mission, Oberlin College emphasizes undergraduate research and hence endeavors to provide the facilities and institutional support to sustain meaningful, student-centered faculty research. Numerous science faculty have externally funded research programs, an increasing number of which depend on high-performance computing. The cluster will be used by more than a dozen Oberlin faculty in departments throughout the natural and social sciences to support a diverse array of research, ranging from modeling black hole collisions to analyzing the effects of organic molecules on air quality, and from determining the protein characteristics of the earliest life on Earth to reconstructing the evolution of flowering plants using massive amounts of DNA sequence data. The award will also have a dramatic impact on student research and training. More than 100 Oberlin undergraduates per year will perform analyses on the computing cluster through mentored research and class-associated projects in at least eight courses, in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Physics, and Psychology.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The award will fund the acquisition of a greatly improved high-performance computational (HPC) cluster that will fill a pressing need for computational support of research, research training, and teaching at Oberlin College. To facilitate the diverse computational needs of Oberlin science faculty, a cluster that maximizes parallelization while also offering multiple nodes with relatively large amounts of RAM for protein folding analyses, de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing data, and large-scale phylogenetic analyses will be installed. The cluster will include at least 38 Intel Xeon E5 compute nodes with a total of 544 cores, with RAM varying across these nodes from 32 GB/node to 512 GB/node. The cluster will also include at least two Nvidia Tesla K20 GPUs and at least two Intel Xeon Phi 5110P coprocessors to dramatically increase processing speeds for jobs that are embarrassingly parallel, and will have at least 244 TB of long-term storage space. The HPC cluster will thus have sufficient computational power and long-term archival storage to advance the increasingly large genomics, chemistry, and physics data sets that several Oberlin faculty now use in their research, and will have the flexibility to be utilized by the increasing number of Oberlin faculty who incorporate HPC work in their research, including in astrophysics, genomics, phylogenetics, proteomics, metabolomics, biophysics, atmospheric chemistry, behavioral psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and computer science.","puce"

Many of them are organized as federal republics, like the U.S., with a division of powers between a federal government and the governments of the individual constituent units, often called states. However, new democracies have found that instituting these arrangements -- defining the powers and delineating the units -- can lead to violent contestation even though federalism is promoted as a broad-based solution to managing ethnic-territorial civil conflicts, expediting national economic development, and enhancing democracy. This raises questions about the human dimensions of instituting federalism. How do citizens experience federal change? How do citizens of different ethnicities and other affiliations come to feel included or excluded at the local level? How do their feelings of local attachment affect their attachment to the nation and the quality of the democracy that results? These are important questions for understanding what makes democracy work or not work in the world today. To investigate these questions, Yale University anthropology graduate student, Amy Johnson, under the supervision of Dr. Kalyanakrishnan Sivaramakrishnan, will undertake research in Nepal. Nepal is currently transitioning to federal governance following the conclusion of a ten-year civil conflict (1996-2006), making it an ideal location for the research. By studying how a system of federal provinces is demarcated and institutionalized as it is taking place, the research addresses fundamental questions about the relationship between structures of governance, political participation, and sentiments of national belonging. <br/><br/>To understand how diverse regional and socio-economic groups engage with the process of producing a federal system, Johnson will collect data at three organizational levels: a multi-ethnic local community in a region that has seen recent violence in response to the implementation of federalism; a district that bridges the local and the national administrative relationships; and the capital, where lawmakers and state-restructuring experts are designing Nepal's federal provinces and accompanying administrative and legal policies. In each locale, she will employ a mix of social science methods, including: ethnographic participant observation, life history interviews with multiple stakeholders, and archival research. Findings from this research will offer insight into how federal arrangements are achieved within unique cultural contexts, expanding understanding of federalism beyond its theorization as a technical-financial system and toward greater knowledge of its human dimensions, wherever federalism is found.","maroon"

Although low-ductility steel braced frames have brittle brace elements and connections, they can achieve system ductility if their gravity framing and gusset plate connections act partially-restrained after braces fracture. These partially-restrained connections form a ""reserve"" moment frame system that can prevent sidesway collapse even when the primary lateral force resisting system is significantly damaged. Design provisions for steel structures in low and moderate seismic regions implicitly rely on reserve capacity for collapse prevention, even though the nature of this reserve capacity is not well-understood and can vary widely. Thus, there is an essential need for clarity and consistency in considering reserve capacity for seismic design in moderate seismic regions. Foundational understanding of reserve capacity will provide broad national benefit by establishing an economical and reliable framework for design of new buildings in low and moderate seismic regions and for evaluation of existing buildings in all seismic regions of the United States. These significant contributions will be accomplished through integration of large-scale testing, design studies, computational simulations, and reliability-based performance assessments. The research team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Tufts University will use the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities at Lehigh University. Collaboration with complementary research being conducted at Ecole Polytechnique Montreal will provide valuable synergistic opportunities and enhance the research impact. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository (http://www.nees.org).<br/><br/>The philosophy and application of system reserve capacity developed out of this research will open new possibilities for designing and assessing structures in all seismic regions, with special importance for moderate seismic regions, renovation in high seismic regions, and the design of special structures. Engineers will have simple yet effective tools for rationally designing and assessing low-ductility structures using reserve capacity to prevent seismic collapse. This philosophy of reserve capacity, which prioritizes cost reduction over achieving optimum levels of ductility, can also significantly impact design in developing countries where the seismic details that have become standards in the United States are not affordable or achievable with available technology. While this work focuses on steel structures, the scope of reserve capacity is much broader and more general. Once understood in the context of steel, reserve capacity may also find uses in other materials and systems both in the United States and abroad.

While agents' interests are typically captured by preferences over material outcomes such as money and consumption goods, this is often insufficient for real-world interactions. For example, many of today's social and economic interactions take place online, and records of the interactions are archived, maintained, and often spread to others. In such interactions agents are motivated not only by the resulting material outcomes, but possibly also by concerns about what and how much of their private information is revealed in the course of the interaction. Agents may, for example, prefer one outcome to another when their private information is revealed, but may prefer the latter outcome to the former if no information is revealed. They may value privacy, and wish to prevent the leakage of their private information. Alternatively, they may wish to credibly disclose their private information as a signal to others. This project develops a model of information-sensitive agents that captures these kinds of preferences, and examines the problem of designing ineractions for such agents.<br/><br/>Some of the questions addressed in this project are: Do the mechanisms that exist in the current theoretical literature and in practice still ""work"" when agents have information-sensitive preferences? Is it possible to design mechanisms that are robust to various levels of information-sensitivity of the agents? Are there mechanisms that have additional desirable properties, such as the preservation of privacy or the credible disclosure of information?<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project are twofold. First, a prevalent form of information-sensitivity is a predilection for privacy, one of the most debated issues in electronic commerce. Since this project examines the strategic implications of privacy, it has the potential to contribute valuable insights to this heated debate. Second, information-sensitivity is particularly relevant when agents participate in numerous mechanisms, in which case the leakage of information from one mechanism to another becomes a critical consideration. By explicitly including concerns for information leakage, this project facilitates the design and analysis of economic mechanisms that are both more robust and more modular.","ivory"

Our research aims at developing a quantitative measure of robot motor capability of a humanoid root motor system for the application of transferring human skills to a humanoid robot. An in-depth study of basic intrinsic properties of robot motor capability based on information theory will be performed to derive a pseudo index of motor performance. This pseudo index of motor performance is derived from robot kinematics, dynamics, and control with the speed-accuracy constraint taken into consideration. With the speed-accuracy constraint, the motor performance of a robot is optimized to accomplish a task. The research results demonstrate an increased understanding of robot motor capability that shows the capability and limitation of a robot for learning skills from human demonstration. The project plans to verify the result on an existing humanoid robot. The project results will provide new insights in humanoid robot motor learning and control, and launch a new research direction on human-robot interaction when both humans and robots better know their respective motor capabilities. The broader impacts include incorporation of research results into existing graduate and undergraduate robotics courses, and outreach activities of a weeklong robotics summer camp and a lab open house for high-school students. The research results will be disseminated in professional conferences, workshops and archival journal publications.","indigo"

This award will continue funding this fundamental oceanographic time-series, lengthening the record of data and allowing for a better understanding of how the observed flux patterns relate to the interplay between climate and ocean functioning. Continued support of the time series will provide training and educational opportunities for young scientists from high school students through postdoctoral researchers, and results will tie into other time-series efforts in the Bermuda region. <br/><br/>Understanding of ocean variability over interannual and decadal time-scales is of widespread interest and increasing relevance given the concerns over anthropogenic perturbations of global climate and ocean chemistry due to increases in greenhouse gases.

This requires a fundamental understanding of how the ocean and its biota naturally respond to climate and environmental forcing variables, and how these responses, in turn, affect ocean biogeochemical cycles. The OFP time-series has produced a unique unsurpassed record of temporal variability in the ""biological pump"", a term loosely applied to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses.

In understanding and optimization of these systems, an accurate predictive capacity is critical. Since the physics of the interacting force fields in such systems are complex, a multi-scale approach is necessary, requiring large-scale simulations. The proposed research aims to develop cost-effective and accurate predictive approaches for multi-scale computations of nanoparticulate systems.<br/><br/>Multiscale dynamics simulation of self-assembly and transport of nanoparticles in both dry and wet nanoparticulate systems will be performed by integrating sub-models at different scales using data-enabled approaches. The unique behavior of the dry particulate systems is that they present both solid-like and liquid-like features leading to a number of fascinating characters. Understanding the transport of nanoparticles in wet particulate systems through multi-scale computation will significantly improve the process by revealing dominant parameters to obtain desirable final nanostructure. An ""objective-driven"" method will be utilized to regenerate appropriate parameter sets by combining Ab initio calculation for interatomic force construction and Monte Carlo optimization of parameters. A multiscale computation, which covers atom-atom, atom-cluster, and cluster-cluster scales, will be carried out through a data-stream support methodology. Through atom-atom level simulation, crucial sets of force field (FF) parameters will be generated; the atom-cluster level computation will mainly investigate interactions between a single or a group of clusters (nanoparticles) and immersing flowing liquid molecules. Once all the infrastructures are well established via reconstructing innovative cage particle and porting to extensible LAMMPS, many phenomena associated with self-assembly and transport in nanoparticulate systems can be rigorously computed under this framework. <br/><br/>The general ""objective-driven"" method will be implemented into software to meet needs of many optimizations works, including obtaining desired FF parameters.

The outcome of the research will be disseminated through publications in archival journals, presentations at national and international conferences, and students' thesis/dissertations.

In recent years a mysterious and severe form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) has emerged in several agricultural communities around the world. Those affected are predominantly young and middle aged male agricultural workers who do not suffer from the risk factors typically associated with kidney disease. While the exact cause of CKDu is still a source of scientific uncertainty, narratives that link the disease to the agrarian landscape have captivated popular imagination and influence farmers' cultivation practices, albeit in uneven, haphazard, and poorly understood ways. This project builds upon political ecology of health and science and technology studies (STS) to investigate how uncertainty about the cause of CKDu shapes health-environment interactions and agrarian landscapes and livelihoods. In doing so, it will account for the complex ways that farmers perceive and act on agricultural health risks while illuminating how contested understandings of environmental illnesses can fundamentally restructure agricultural practices, systems of production, and relations of expertise. Through this analysis, the proposed research will contribute directly to the development of policies and programs that facilitate agrarian livelihoods in the context of disease. <br/><br/>Since the first reports of the emergence of a new form of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) in the early 1990s, Sri Lanka's once peripheral dry zone has become the epicenter of an epidemic that is slowly crippling agricultural communities across the island's rice belt. The proposed project focuses on three dimensions of the relationship between CKDu and agricultural practices to explain how this scientifically contested illness is remade into an agricultural problem, and with what effects. First, the project investigates how ideas about the environment and its links to disease are formed, reinforced, and circulated. Second, it evaluates how farmers' cultivation practices are changing in response to the problem of CKDu and documents their shifts to native rice varieties and also to organic - or chemical free - systems of production, albeit in spatially uneven and sometimes transitory ways. Additionally, this study investigates how uncertainty about CKDu's cause mediates farmers' interactions with the environment and shapes the uneven adoption of native seeds as disease management strategies. Finally, the project examines how relationships between health and agricultural modernization in the dry zone have changed over time and inform contemporary agrarian shifts in response to CKDu. The project integrates archival research, ethnographic methods, and household surveys to study two dry zone farming communities. Findings of this research will provide insights into how contested agri-environmental-health problems shape practices of disease management and give rise to new forms of agricultural production. While this research is anchored in an analysis of shifting agrarian livelihoods in CKDu endemic areas of Sri Lanka, its findings will be applicable to other geographic regions where parallel epidemics of mystery kidney disease are found in agricultural communities such as India, Egypt, and Central America.","maroon"

This workshop will bring together 30-50 persons with scientific and/or policy expertise within one or more elements of the FEWS nexus with the goal of identifying key drivers and linkages, emergent properties, and critical research needs within the context of ecological sustainability. The participants will focus on the Mekong River Basin as an archetypal FEW coupled social-ecological system. More than 60 million people living in the Mekong are highly dependent on the river for food and livelihoods. Wild-caught fish and rice are the primary sources of nutrition, with the productivity of both fisheries and rice agriculture dependent on the natural flood-pulse hydrologic regime. The river is facing potentially large changes to the flood-pulse from mainstream and tributary hydropower development, rapid land use change and climate change. The economic benefits of new energy are expected to be substantial, but the social and environmental impacts are at present poorly understood. Fisheries/agriculture, hydrologic dynamics, and hydropower therefore form the food, water, and energy trilemma in the Mekong and are linked in both space and time. The results of this workshop will create a foundation for understanding the interconnected and interdependent nature of FEW dynamics in the Mekong and other river ecosystems. The project will support both education and diversity by enhancing the scientific capacity of Mekong scientists and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Large river ecosystems provide numerous and dynamic ecosystem goods and services to people. Despite a general understanding of the types of goods and services derived from rivers and a widespread recognition of their social and economic benefit, there is a distinct lack of conceptual and quantitative frameworks for evaluating the physical, biological, and social dynamics that create ecosystem services and livelihoods. As such, there is limited ability to understand impacts from ecosystem change and to evaluate tradeoffs. This workshop will begin to address these limitations by: 1) developing a conceptual model of how multiple physical, social, and ecological processes connect and structure FEW systems in large rivers; 2) within this framework identify key linkages and flows for maintaining sustainability; 3) evaluate currently available data and capacity for quantifying these processes; and 4) identify key future research needs for addressing research conceptual and data gaps. The principal investigators have identified an initial set of 60 potential invitees, including international representation from a range of institutions active in the Mekong region. These include academic, governmental (US and Mekong), intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. The investigators intend to invite 50-70 participants expecting 30-35 to attend with greater than 40% participation by women and underrepresented minorities.

In particular, the algorithms developed are being employed to create a novel multi-source and multi-scale event reconstruction system that brings together the massive archives of the Apollo lunar missions, to create experiential interaction with historical materials. Specific research advancements are focused on state of the art acoustic environment analysis, speech recognition including keyword spotting, speaker identification under adverse conditions, multimodal content alignment, and automated linking for events and entities from spoken content. Specifically, the research is developing: (i) new techniques for noise- and channel-robust acoustic processing, exploiting missing-features concepts with novel feature extraction and compensation techniques, (ii) a new articulatory framework for speech recognition for robustness to variations in speech production, (iii) environmental ""sniffing"" techniques to automatically characterize acoustic environments to improve robustness, and (iv) automatic detection of novel task-specific audio-events. Since the data is asynchronous, unique speech analytics techniques are being formulated to address the large number of ""local loop"" intercom circuits in the NASA Mission Control Center, audio recorded onboard the two Apollo spacecrafts during specific mission events, and space-to-ground radio circuits. The specific speech, language, and knowledge extraction advancements will be integrated into a new automated evaluation model that reflects specific challenges encountered in the event reconstruction task. This platform will be deployed and evaluated by actual users from the Science and Engineering Education Center (SEEC) of the University of Texas at Dallas. <br/><br/>Integration of robust speech processing algorithms with event reconstruction systems will have a direct and immediate impact on education, society, and government organizations. Working with NASA's Apollo mission data allows for the development of speech technology for challenging audio that contains severe communication channel artifacts, cross-talk/static/tones, and low signal-to-noise ratios. The software being developed in this project will be made available to any non-profit organization for use in audio/video search (download with training modules). Students working on senior design teams will also develop a Contact Science station to be deployed in Dallas, TX and overseen by the University of Texas in Dallas Science and Engineering Education Center to illustrate and assess student use of the advancements. As a lasting legacy for this project, this project team includes eminent historians of human space flight, who will explore opportunities to deploy this event reconstruction system in a museum setting where it can support both scholarship and public engagement, and we will make the system itself available on an open-source basis to support other researchers.","indigo"

Additionally precipitation is projected to become more intense, variability on all timescales stronger and significant shifts to occur in the seasonal cycles of precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow. While these projected changes will have serious implications for water resources, agriculture, rangelands, wildlife management and natural ecosystems including forests, fire, etc. it must be noted that the model simulations of radiatively-driven hydroclimate change to data are not in close accord with actual change. This could be because the models are wrong or radiatively-driven change is being obscured by potent natural variability. <br/><br/>The work will involve three interwoven efforts: <br/>1) analysis of policy and management decisions to identify needs for ecosystem and water management, and how to translate science to meet those needs, <br/>2) an assessment of how long term changes in those climate features identified as management-relevant in the decision analysis, play out in terms of day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year weather and <br/>3) application of hydroclimate information to problems in water resources and ecosystem management in the monsoon region and ecosystem management in the Plains. <br/><br/>Evolution of near term climate due to both natural variability and forced change will be considered, including changes in frequencies and locations of storms, lengths of dry spells, extreme wet or dry years, seasonality etc. Observational records and Reanalyses, including the 20th Century Reanalysis, will be analyzed as well as the models participating in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5.

By providing a better understanding of the landscape impacts of modified geomorphological patterns, this research has the potential for identifying bedrock (strath) terraces as a physiographic demarcator of the current geologic epoch, which has been called the Anthropocene by many scientists. Project findings will inform water transportation engineers and floodplain restoration agencies seeking to institute better management and restoration strategies for river systems.

In other words, dense water from beyond the shelf break that is depleted in dissolved oxygen is drawn along the seafloor upwards onto the shelf, mixing with the oxygenated water there, and creating low oxygen (hypoxic) zones. This is a paradigm that the researcher in this project seeks to shift by analyzing the added effects of respiration in shelf sediments. The investigator hypothesizes that changes in the biological activity of sediments due to seasonal changes in organic matter input from overlying waters are a major factor in the changes in dissolved oxygen content of deep shelf water, perhaps being the leading variable in the creation of hypoxic zones. Though the field analysis will be confined to the Oregon margin, there is a great deal of applicability for this research in other coastal regions where hypoxic zones form. In addition to the potential for unraveling complex local feedbacks between physical and biogeochemical processes, the researcher plans to work with a small business called Analytical Instrument Systems to build a new oxygen sensor, called a rotating disc microelectrode (RDME), that does not intrude on the environment it is testing and that can be deployed for much longer periods of time than currently popular sensors, micro-optodes. Her RDME will be deployed with micro-optodes for comparison and to validate the necessity for the RDME in the study of coastal ecosystems. This project will provide a unique experience for a postdoctoral researcher as well as a graduate and three undergraduate students. A public database will be created which will greatly help with accessibility and archiving of data for anyone who is interested in similar research. The database will be connected with a variety of other ocean observing data products, which will allow the research community and the public to make connections outside of this particular field of study. This investigator has a strong track record of including Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students in her research, and she will continue to do so in this project. <br/><br/>The researcher aims to challenge the paradigm that hypoxic zones on the Oregon shelf are created by upwelling of offshelf oxygen-depleted water and that most of the local primary productivity is exported off the shelf during downwelling periods. Preliminary data suggests the possibility that seasonal benthic respiration may be a major factor in hypoxic water formation on the shelf. With the use of eddy covariance measurements, sediment core incubations, and near seabed particulate organic matter (POM) collections, the biogeochemical fluxes of the Oregon margin will be characterized for every season. This work is ambitious on its own, but the investigator also plans to incorporate the development of a new oxygen sensor called a rotating disc microelectrode (RDME) that will be compared to currently popular micro-optodes when making eddy covariance measurements. The RDME will be small enough as not to interfere with the physical properties being measured in situ; it will be insensitive to flow and deployable for longer periods of time. Not only does this project contain the possibility of completely overturning the current best theory of hypoxic zone formation on shelf margins, but the use of eddy covariance is new to the study of dynamic coastal ecosystems and will yield great insights into the biogeochemical processes of shelf benthos.","lavender"

One of the richest archives of the biotic and environmental changes on land for this period is on the Colorado Plateau, which despite over 100 years of study still remains poorly calibrated in time and poorly registered to the rest of the global record. To provide this desiderata, we will drill a continuous a ~500 m core through nearly the entire Triassic age section (Chinle and Moenkopi formations) at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP), Arizona, USA, one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth. A continuous sampling (core) is needed to place this spectacular record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, which has proved impractical in outcrop. The Petrified Forest core will provide a quantitatively sound reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition and will provide pristine unweathered samples. With such a reference section in hand the entire voluminous assemblage of outcrop data from the PFNP and the surrounding region can be integrated into the global framework. The hole will be deviated 30ï¿½ from vertical to provide core-bedding orientation intersections for an azimuthal guide; additionally, the orientation of the core will be registered to the hole wall using whole-core-scans and compass-oriented acoustic and optical televiewer images and dipmeter surveys. Core orientation will facilitate the recovery of a high-resolution magnetic polarity stratigraphy for correlation to the fossil-rich outcrop sections. The polarity sequence will be calibrated by a series of high-precision U-Pb zircon dates obtained from discrete levels in the core, and will provide critical data to fill the geochronologic gap in global terrestrial and marine time scales for the Late Triassic. The age-calibrated chronostratigraphy of the PFNP core will be used to address major issues of early Mesozoic biotic and environmental change. These include whether marine and continental biotic turnover events in the Late Triassic were coupled; was the largest magnitude faunal turnover event on land during the Late Triassic synchronous with the giant Manicouagan impact; Is the NSF-funded Newark basin astronomically-calibrated time scale consistent with high precision U-Pb zircon age data from the Chinle Formation; and was the cyclical climate change recorded in the Newark basin lacustrine record paced by Milankovitch climate change? <br/> In addition to the science generated by the core and its integration into the local and global environmental and biotic framework, the project will have a major education and outreach component. The Petrified Forest National Park is a major tourist destination, averaging 600,000 visitors a year. We plan to leverage this huge resource by developing a permanent exhibit on the coring project and its important scientific results for the park. We will involve numerous student groups during the actual coring activities, including Native American geoscience concentrators at The University of New Mexico/Gallup and K-12 students from throughout the Gallup area. In addition, we will sponsor several workshops at the Park and will reach out to the general public for their participation. The project involves six co-PIs from different institutions and will last 24 months and is intended to provide an initial synopsis of basic stratigraphic, logging, magnetic polarity, and geochronologic data for utilization by the international scientific community for further research and integration with other studies, as well as a major platform for outreach, and a better understanding of how the modern world came to be.","hot_pink"

The project digitalizes and brings together various archival records, including detailed operational and financial reports, prices and wages, hired labor, and information about key individuals (founders, major shareholders, executives, top managers and engineers) for the universe of all firms, from the time of the industry?s inception until the end of World War I. Conventional wisdom emphasizes the role of government industry promotion and its protectionist role, but the project?s early results indicate that innovation was spearheaded by private entrepreneurs. New technologies and markets developed through private initiative, as resource reallocation, was facilitated by novel organizational forms and competitive markets. Government contributed primarily through preventing entrenched monopolies and ensuring the conditions for free entry and fair competition.","aquamarine"

Regional impacts can be catastrophic, including drought, wildfires, flooding, mudslides, and fisheries collapse. Furthermore, ENSO has a significant influence on global mean air temperature, and a strong El Niï¿½o event contributed to the record warmth experienced during 2015-2016. Despite the clear importance of ENSO to modern climate variability, the computer models used to make climate projections offer no clear consensus on ENSO's future behavior. The various computer models can be improved, with broad benefit to society, by evaluating their ability to simulate past time periods when ENSO behaved differently. However, that approach requires more and better paleo-ENSO observations from geologic archives like ocean sediment cores. This project aims to ground-truth a new method to reconstruct ENSO variability during the geologic past. It relies on the fact that the chemistry of microscopic seashells (foraminifera) reflects the temperature at which the shell formed. By measuring the chemistry of numerous individual shells, researchers will be able to reconstruct the variability of sea surface temperature in regions where temperature is dominated by the ENSO phenomenon. This project will also provide extensive learning and training experiences for a female PhD student and two undergraduates.<br/><br/>More specifically, the work proposed here will develop a new proxy for sea surface temperature variability, ""wet chemistry"" Mg/Ca ratios in individual planktic foraminifera, for probing ENSO variance during the past. Preliminary measurements and Monte Carlo simulations show that individual foraminifera from well-preserved sediments are reliable recorders of calcification temperature. Past changes in ENSO variance should therefore leave imprints on the distributions of individuals' Mg/Ca at carefully chosen core sites. In the tropical Pacific however, seafloor dissolution of CaCO3 and low sedimentation rates present dual challenges to this method, so it will be important to ground-truth the approach using late Holocene sediments. This work will use single-specimen Mg/Ca in two species of planktic foraminifera to test two main hypotheses: (1) The observed lowering of planktic foraminiferal Mg/Ca in partially dissolved samples is caused by a percentage Mg loss from each shell, and not by a molar amount lost, nor by breakup and loss of higher-Mg individuals formed in warmer waters; (2) Regardless of the exact nature of the dissolution artifact, information about temperature variability (including ENSO) is retained in single-specimen Mg/Ca distributions from tropical Pacific core top sediments above the lysocline. Hypothesis 1 will be tested using four core tops from a depth transect on Ontong Java Plateau in the western tropical Pacific, and Hypothesis 2 will be tested using 10 additional core tops spanning a range of annual and interannual temperature variability regimes across the tropical Pacific.","lavender"

Changes&#8232;in storm activity, and associated atmospheric feedbacks, have been linked to increased seasonality of the high north in the last decade, and with sea ice depletion during summer months. Cyclones are also likely to respond to changes in Arctic ice cover and ocean state indicating that&#8232;the atmosphere-ocean-ice system is tightly coupled through processes related to cyclones. Previous Arctic modeling studies typically used regional model simulations without full coupling&#8232;of the atmosphere-ocean-ice system, or fully coupled global climate models that do not permit year-on-year comparison with the observational record. This study will avoid such limitations by using&#8232;the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), for which output corresponds directly with month-on-month observational records. This&#8232;will allow assessment of the ice-ocean-atmosphere coupling processes on multiple temporal&#8232;and spatial scales, and to relate them to limited Arctic Ocean measurements to build a more complete understanding of how increased cyclone activity may be helping to shift the surface climate of the Arctic to a new, warmer state with seasonal sea ice cover, and of how cyclones&#8232;will respond to this new Arctic Ocean state. <br/><br/>The impact of cyclones on Arctic stakeholder sectors in northern and western Alaska, including coastal communities and marine transport, will be assessed through a partnership with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy and the project's inventory of Arctic cyclones and associated ocean and sea ice conditions will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Historical time series of annual and seasonal Arctic cyclone activity, maps of tracks and intensities of Arctic cyclones, and case studies of intense or impactful cyclones will be made available on a project web page. The project will engage graduate students and a post-doctoral fellow,&#8232;and results will be used in atmospheric and oceanic science undergraduate and graduate level courses at the project institutions. Outcomes from this work will be address priorities in the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region and will address key uncertainties in understanding extreme events and their role in the Arctic climate system. <br/><br/>The recent loss of Arctic sea ice has increased the potential for ocean-atmosphere coupling&#8232;in the Arctic, especially in areas of low ice concentration or where the ice edge has receded. An important aspect of increased ocean-atmosphere Arctic coupling is the&#8232; potential increase&#8232;of the ocean's response to storms. Where once mitigated by thick ice, wind-induced ice deformation and oceanic mixing are increasing as the ice pack thins. The decreasing Arctic ice cover and associated warming of the Arctic Ocean may also impact cyclone intensity and frequency. This grant will support investigation of changes in atmosphere-ice-ocean coupling in the presence of cyclones in the Arctic. It will advance our understanding of coupled atmosphere-ocean-ice processes with a focus on the role and response of cyclones in altering the state of the Arctic system. A cyclone tracking scheme will be applied to reanalyses, yielding an inventory of Arctic cyclone locations, tracks, and intensities that will provide a framework for analysis of ice and upper-ocean responses to storms. The responses of ice concentration, ocean temperature and salinity, and associated ice mass balance before, during, and after cyclones at a variety of intensities will be documented. The same analysis will be applied&#8232;to output from the high-resolution Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and to output from&#8232;a suite of global climate models (GCMs). Using a novel set of metrics computed from the output of RASM, peak temporal and spatial scales of oceanic mixing, sea ice deformation, and turbulent fluxes associated with the passage of storms in the Arctic will be determined, in order to assess coupled cyclone-ocean-sea ice processes. Changes in the cyclone climatology between pairs of coupled RASM simulations, that differ only in sea ice and ocean state, and in current and end of the 21st century CMIP5 simulations will allow for assessment of cyclone response to changing ocean and ice state.

Recent Turkish political history provides a unique case to test and extend theories on this issue. Between 1989 and 2002, Turkey witnessed 11 consecutive governments. This tumultuous period ended only when the economic crises of 2000/2001 altered power relations, resulting in unpopular reforms that led to the election of the Justice and Development Party. The JDP has maintained its political hegemony since then, winning consecutive landslide victories over the last 13 years. Why were the short-lived governments of Turkey's lost decade of the 1990s unable to prevent the breakup of their respective regimes? How was it possible for the current JDP to maintain its rule since 2002? This research hypothesizes that: (1) The dynamics between the banking sector and the public debt regime systematically generated conflicts among the ruling elite, inhibiting political parties from forming viable coalitions during the 1990s, and that (2) the successful resolutions of these conflicts after the 2001 economic crisis account for the JDP's ability to bring about stability. With a focus on finance and state-capital relations, I seek to explore an overlooked, but potentially significant, factor shaping political arrangements.<br/><br/>This project employs a qualitative research methodology, based on a detailed within-case comparative historical-sociological analysis. The project uses two research strategies that are widely used by sociologists: an extensive historical investigation of archived materials produced by selected state institutions and private organizations, and semi-structured in-depth interviews with political and economic elites in Turkey. Combining these two primary sources, I aim not only to understand micro-level dynamics of political stability by scrutinizing incentives behind how elites reach (or fail to reach) consensus under given economic constraints and political pressures, but also to discover larger structural and institutional forces underlying political decision-making processes at the state level. Therefore, this research will produce reproducible, generalizable and falsifiable results since the findings and claims can be tested against ?matching? (positive or negative) historically situated and/or counter-factual cases. The project's analysis of how finance shapes electoral politics and governing institutions can potentially offer generalizable policy suggestions concerning developmental issues and democratic governance practices.","crimson"

This research will allow the principal investigators to constrain both magnitude and age of faulting and gain insight into the geometry of these faults along a fundamental plate boundary between India and Asia in the Nepalese Himalaya, which will provide fundamental insights into how convergent plate margins evolve through time. This region is the site of large, destructive earthquakes that are a function of both geometry of the faults and the rates at which these faults move; thus, the research has the potential to further understanding in a region of active seismicity. This proposal combines thermochronometry (the age at which minerals cool) with numerical modeling to determine fault magnitude, geometry and rate. Geologic mapping and associated cross sections provide an estimate of fault geometry. This geometry provides a testable path along which rocks were displaced and cooled from the subsurface to the Earth's surface.

However, the interpretations of thermochronometric data are critically dependent on determining the correct thermal, kinematic, and erosion models. Understanding how fault magnitude, geometry and rate are related to exhumation in compressional systems requires quantitatively linking the geometry and magnitude of fault slip to the distribution and amount of erosion. In this project, the principal investigators suggest that the geometry of fold-thrust belts is best delineated through balanced geologic cross-sections, and they hypothesize that the geometry of a fold-thrust belt, particularly the location and magnitude of ramps in the decollement, control the first-order pattern of cooling ages. To address this hypothesis they will apply a 2 dimensional thermo-kinematic and erosion model to forward modeled balanced cross sections to quantify the cooling history in a thrust belt setting. Balanced cross-sections provide the kinematic sequence of rocks and structures necessary to reproduce the mapped surface geology. The principal investigators will test the validity of this kinematic sequence by assigning ages over which displacement occurs, and use the range of potential velocity vectors to calculate heat transport, erosion, and rock cooling. Matching the measured cooling histories recorded by a suite of thermochronometers to that predicted by the kinematics of a balanced cross-section is an additional support for the validation of the cross section. This work will examine proposed structural geometries, the cooling ages of rocks and their interdependence in central Nepal and far western Nepal. In central Nepal, there is an abundance of geochronologic/thermochronologic data and recent maps and cross section interpretations. In far western Nepal, there are detailed maps and cross section interpretations with a growing body of geochronologic/thermochronologic data. The researchers will capitalize on these established and growing datasets to test our hypothesis by 1) evaluating a range of permissible geometries for balanced-sections (both prior to and following field work), 2) collecting critical field observations (bedding, foliation, cleavage) and necessary thermochronologic samples, 3) establishing the cooling history of duplexes and thrust sheets via a suite of thermochronometers, and 4) modeling the dependence of chronometers on structural geometries, displacement paths and rates. The intellectual merit of this project involves investigating the sensitivity and utility of thermochronometer and kinematic data for calculating the age and rate of thrust motion and associated exhumation. Using this approach in Nepal, the principal investigators can evaluate the range of shortening rates in space and time and determine if long-term shortening rates though the Himalaya are constant or variable. These methods/processes will be transportable to other contractional systems worldwide and will lead to a reevaluation of the kinematics, geometry and rates in orogenic systems.","hot_pink"

The reasoning involved in age-model construction is complex, subtle, and scientifically demanding because the processes that control the rate of material accumulation over time, and that affect the core between formation and sampling, are unknown. Geoscientists approach this problem by treating the core like a crime scene and asking the question: ""What physical and chemical processes could have produced this situation, and what does that say about the timeline?"" However, the sheer number of possibilities, coupled with the volume and complexity of the climatology data that is currently available and is continually collected, severely limit the scope of these investigations. The goal of this project is to remove this roadblock. This research will lead to an integrated software tool called CScibox, that uses automated reasoning techniques to help scientists analyze ice and sediment cores. It employs a cyberinfrastructure that provides powerful, intuitive tools on a scientist's desktop while taking full advantage of modern data- and computation-intensive computing and networking infrastructure -- including workflow-based computation, parallel execution, distributed systems, cluster machines and the cloud. <br/><br/>CScibox will not only improve the ability of individual geoscientists analyze single cores; it has the potential to transform the field of paleoclimatology by facilitating rapid, reproducible analysis and synthesis of the information in the diverse collections of raw data available in data archives to foster understanding and improved scientific decision making. This will have broad impacts for society by allowing scientists to develop deeper insights into the roles of various factors in the complex relationships that give rise to geological records of the earth's climate that are used in today's models of environmental change. This project also has a broad educational impact. Students involved in the development and implementation of CScibox will develop skills in interdisciplinary research and will learn how to apply computational methodology in a challenging scientific context that has not yet significantly benefitted from developments in information technology. CScibox is designed to be easy to install and use; see the project web site (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~lizb/cscience.html) for source code, documentation, and examples of its use. Future steps include extending the work to other paleoclimate data, working with geoscientists to make the user interface as intuitive as possible, and holding demos and workshops at geosciences conferences to educate that community about what the tool can do and how to use it.","indigo"

The investigators will target seven rivers for sampling. River sampling will occur during different flow regimes, but will emphasize sample collection during the spring freshet, the time of year when terrestrial runoff from local CAA rivers maximally impacts coastal waters. Estuarine sampling will include both horizontal and vertical profiles. The data will be synthesized and interpreted using mixing models and regression analyses, and compared with data for the Mackenzie and Yukon Rivers, which have historically been considered ""typical"" for North American runoff to the Arctic. Acceleration of glacial melt and the hydrologic cycle in a warmer world will likely increase local inputs of freshwater to the CAA. Because many such changes may already be underway, it is important to establish a baseline by which future changes can be compared. The proposed research has implications regarding the variability and magnitude of freshwater export from the Arctic and subarctic oceans to the North Atlantic, and the findings will help fill significant gaps in the knowledge of CAA river geochemistry and the Arctic freshwater cycle. The project will catalyze a new partnership among faculty, researchers, and students at the Applied Physics Laboratory and Northwestern University.

Although the land biosphere also contributes to seasonal variations in O2/N2 ratio, the ocean contribution can be resolved by combining O2/N2 and CO2 data to compute the tracer atmospheric potential oxygen (APO), which is effectively an atmospheric tracer of ocean biology and chemistry.

This study will extend both the spatial and temporal resolution of paleoclimate data for the WPWP by studying cave formations (stalagmites) for two key periods: the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19,000-21,000 years ago), when the mean climate was much colder than today, and the deglaciation (11,000-19,000 years ago), during which the global climate went through abrupt changes. Comparison between the cave data from a network of sites and model outputs will strengthen the climate interpretations made, and will improve the fidelity of both the reconstructions and the climate models. <br/><br/>This study will generate time series of stalagmite d18O, an established proxy for rainfall amount in the tropics, from the Philippines (eastern, central, and western sites), the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. These sites cover a wide range of precipitation variability, as seen during the modern era, and will provide information about past climate variability at sites that currently have little to no data. This study will sample the full range of the WPWP hydrologic response to climate change by reconstructing rainfall from the LGM to the Holocene. The end members of the cold LGM and the warm Holocene provide a measure of how sensitive WPWP rainfall is to global mean temperature. The temporal evolution during the deglaciation reveals the magnitude and spatial pattern of WPWP rainfall changes associated with abrupt climate events, and how much of a role the tropics participate in these events. The proxy data will be compared with various climate model simulations from the CMIP5 and PMIP2/PMIP3 archives and other sources, focusing on the spatial pattern and seasonality of climate changes, as well as the commonalities and diversity of different models. To investigate the teleconnection mechanisms of past abrupt climate changes, additional experiments will also be conducted with an atmospheric model. The proxy-model comparison will help validate climate models, which are being used for future climate projections, and the detailed model analysis and additional experiments will elucidate the mechanism of past abrupt climate changes. The research team will work closely with local scientists in the developing countries of Vanuatu and the Philippines, exchanging knowledge about climate issues and water availability, issues that have societal and security implications for small island nations. The project will provide a research experience an undergraduate student recruited through the GEOFORCE program, which is a selective outreach program of the Jackson School of Geosciences that trains high school students, mainly from demographic underrepresented in the geosciences, and involves them in fieldwork.","fuchsia"

The SRM will support research and research training in mineral and rock magnetism and paleomagnetism. Fundamental studies in rock magnetism address the physical mechanisms responsible for the acquisition of magnetism by natural mineral phases and the processes through which that magnetism is either recorded with high fidelity or altered by environmental factors. Mineral magnetic investigations have implications for the development of improved materials for use in many industrial applications. Paleomagnetism studies address the behavior of the Earth?s magnetic field through geologic time and have application to understanding the former positions of continents on Earth, the dynamical behavior and evolution of the geomagnetic field and for interpreting past environmental conditions to better constrain the full spectrum of Earth?s past range of climate conditions.<br/><br/>Fundamental studies of how magnetic phases acquire magnetization and studies of the historical dynamics of the Earth?s magnetic field based on paleointensity observations as recorded in magnetic phases in rocks and natural volcanic glasses will be supported. The SRM will allow studies of weakly magnetized materials and very small synthesized phases given to the high sensitivity of direct current superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) on the requested SRM. Such investigations cannot be accomplished with an extant but much less sensitive spinner magnetometer in the investigator?s laboratory. The instrument will be the first of its kind in the state of Wisconsin and will support regional and international collaborations. The investigator will develop instrument control software that will allow for all SRM measurements to be archived and output in a format compatible with a community mineral, rock and paleomagnetism database (MagIC). The SRM will support student research training with a focus on attracting underreprestented students to the geosciences. This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and may advance the national prosperity and welfare through promoting student training for careers in the physical sciences.<br/><br/>***","hot_pink"

For regions that depend on seasonal rainfall for water resources such as California and the Caribbean, such changes may drastically alter the freshwater resources available, impacting a wide array of agricultural and municipal activities. In order to predict and plan for these changes, it is necessary to understand the variability of rainfall and groundwater resources in the past to accurately replicate the hydrologic cycle in climate models. This study will use fossil shells from a coastal lagoon in the Yucatan Peninsula as archives of past water chemistry, including the element boron. These fossils record groundwater discharge which is directly related to the amount of precipitation falling over the Yucatan. The researcher will collaborate with Dr. Chen-Feng You, a world expert on boron, at the National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, which has the clean lab facilities necessary to measure boron in fossil shells.<br/><br/>Two sets of samples will analyzed: one from the Yucatan and one from Taiwan. The Yucatan field site is a brackish lagoon influenced by groundwater springs and ocean water that result in seasonally persistent salinity and pH gradients. Samples consist of several 3 meter long sediment cores covering the past 5,000 years. Foraminifera picked from the core tops and downcore centimeter intervals will be analyzed for the boron isotope 11B, a proxy for pH. Microfossil and water samples will be analyzed on a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer at Dr. You's lab. Variations in 11B suggest changes in water pH and thus changes in the amount of rain-recharged groundwater entering the lagoon. The Taiwan field site is a similar estuary where modern samples will be collected to establish baseline 11B and compared to the Yucatan as a proof of concept for the 11B groundwater discharge proxy.<br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.","chartreuse"

This research will investigate the variability of the monsoon by sampling bottom sediments from four lakes high in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, which are believed to hold a record stretching back well over 6000 years into the past. Understanding the range of variability will help to improve climate models that are used to simulate the region's response to a range of abrupt and long term changes in temperature, wind circulation patterns, and moisture sources. In addition, understanding the past climate conditions of the region will allow a better understanding of the regional plant and animal populations and interactions, as well as changes in the human cultures of the area. This work will strengthen international scientific relationships between U.S. and Chinese scientific institutions, scientists, and students. Support will be provided for two earlier career scientists, a Ph.D. student and undergraduate students. The research team will collaborate with the Center for Earth and Environmental Sciences in Indiana to develop a new outreach module for 4th to 9th graders that will raise the awareness of issues surrounding water resources locally in Indianapolis, IN, and the United States as well as in the monsoon region.<br/><br/>This research will investigate Indian summer monsoon variability during the Holocene with decadally resolved sediment records from four alpine lakes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The proposed research builds on previous NSF-supported work in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, which are a major center of action in the summer monsoon system and a primary gateway for moisture entering the Tibetan Plateau. Results from previous work demonstrate that lakes in the region contain Holocene-length sediment archives which can be dated with radiometric techniques. These lakes also have decadal sedimentation rates and contain a diverse range of climate proxies that capture both local and synoptic monsoon variability. The team will reconstruct local monsoon variability with physical sedimentology and geochemistry, and synoptic variability with hydrogen isotope measurements on terrestrial leaf waxes. The results will be synthesized with paleoclimate records from the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding region, as well as with records from key regions in the global climate system, like the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic, to address three central questions: (i) How did Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall vary on decadal timescales during the Holocene? (ii) Is there evidence for an Indian Summer Monsoon response to changing global climate boundary conditions during the middle Holocene at ~5300 years before present?

The list of key biochemical ?gatekeepers? for activation of the reproductive system from fishes to humans includes two important protein hormones, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin, that function in the brain. This project would investigate how social cues affect these hormones in the brain of an animal model system that is particularly powerful for revealing connections between the social environment and the reproductive system. This animal model is the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a fish species that has been the subject of many foundational studies of environmental influences on reproductive function. This project will use molecular neurobiology methods to map the gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin signaling systems in the brain of the bluehead wrasse, in order to compare the expression of these hormones across different reproductive phases, and to test the effects of manipulating these hormones on reproductive function. A key element of the project is to provide undergraduates from North Carolina State University and Indian River State College in Florida with experience in behavioral field studies and molecular biological laboratory studies. A second benefit will be an increased understanding of the control of reproduction in fishes because the bluehead wrasse is a particularly useful animal for understanding the specific mechanisms of this control. This knowledge is valuable to the aquaculture industry because the control of reproduction represents a key barrier to the propagation of fishes in captivity. Finally, this project will lead to the development of educational materials focused on Florida marine environments in collaboration with the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence. Gene sequences will be archived in Genbank and cDNAs will be provided to interested parties on a cost-of-transport basis.","teal"

The dominant theory is that mantle plumes originate in the deep mantle, transporting material from the core-mantle boundary to the surface, a distance of nearly 3000 km. As such, variations in the chemical composition of lavas erupted at ocean island volcanoes may provide the only way to sample material from such great depths and, in the process, to determine the composition and structure of these otherwise inaccessible parts of the planet. The primary goal of this project is to carry out a field and geochemical study of the 3 oldest Galï¿½pagos Islands to investigate persistent questions related to ocean islands: 1) what is the nature of the material supplying the Galï¿½pagos plume, which in turn will provide information about the composition of the deep Earth; 2) how does the plume's composition vary with time; and 3) how do Galï¿½pagos volcanoes evolve as they are carried away from the plume's center? The latter question, which addresses the life cycle of ocean island volcanoes, is particularly relevant to ongoing conservation and preservation efforts at oceanic archipelagos worldwide.<br/><br/>These questions will be addressed in two stages. First, field studies will be carried out on the 3 oldest, most poorly characterized islands, Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, and Espaï¿½ola, which together record almost 3 million years of the plume's history. Radiogenic isotopes, major and trace element, and Ar-Ar analyses will be applied to understand the chemical evolution. The second phase is a focused effort to define the compositions of Galï¿½pagos mantle reservoirs by applying high-resolution lead isotopic analyses to a selection of lavas from across the archipelago. Taken together, these efforts will permit evaluation of competing hypotheses for the complex geochemical variation observed in the Galï¿½pagos and insight into the origins and nature of mantle plumes. One of the most important goals of this project is the engagement of undergraduates as integral members of the research team. They will also participate in a seminar on mantle dynamics, which will be used to develop a digital repository of presentations by experts in the field that will be archived and made available online. Ecuadorian students will participate in fieldwork and spend a summer at Colgate, where they will also be trained in analytical geochemistry techniques. Finally, students will participate in an established outreach program at Colgate, working with K-12 students from across upstate NY performing hands-on science activities and developing a state-of-the-art presentation on volcanic evolution at the Colgate Visualization Lab.","hot_pink"

Unfortunately, studies have shown mechanical triggers and a variety of sensors to be inadequate in capturing footage of small predators (e.g., snakes, rodents) or events in dense vegetation. Because of this, continuous camera recording is currently the most robust solution for avian monitoring, especially in ground nesting species. However, continuous video footage results in a data deluge, as monitoring enough nests to make biologically significant inferences results in massive amounts of data which is unclassifiable by humans alone. This project will develop a citizen science project which combines volunteer computing, where people volunteer their computers to automatically analyze video with computer vision strategies, and crowd sourcing, where people volunteer their brain power by streaming the videos and reporting observations, to analyze over a hundred thousand of hours of avian nesting video.<br/><br/>This collaborative proposal will address the data deluge in avian research, where data acquisition rates are greatly outpacing the ability to process that data, by gathering, storing, and analyzing nest video at unprecedented scales for evaluating hypotheses about avian reproductive ecology and predator-prey interactions.

In addition,they will use the nesting video to develop a large human annotated archival video resource for ecologists and computer vision researchers alike, generated using crowd sourced volunteer observations validated against each other and further refined by a scientific web portal for expert analysis of the volunteered responses.

Thus, our understanding of magmatic processes is important for both understanding how the Earth works as well as for helping us understand the dangers magmatic events and volcanic eruptions can cause. This research focuses on the story about magmatic processes that occur deep in the Earth as told by tiny inclusions of melt trapped in crystals of plagioclase, one of the most ubiquitous minerals in the Earth's crust. Up until now, melt inclusions in plagioclase have not been considered reliable archives of primary information for volatile geochemical species like H2O, CO2, or S due to diffusion and post entrapment leakage. There have also been questions about the origin of melt inclusions and when and where they form in the history of the plagioclase in which they occur. This research combines innovative laboratory experiments and comprehensive controlled calibration studies to reconstruct the original volatile composition of melt inclusions in plagioclase from ultra-phyric lavas erupted on the seafloor in the Pacific Ocean on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, just west of the Washington and Canadian border. The experiments will be done on both plagioclase and coexisting olivines from the same suite of samples to compare against one another and assess the degree to which post entrapment crystallization and the process of reheating impact the measured volatile content of the inclusions. Time-series experiments will be conducted on a heating stage at various temperatures (from 1200 C to 1270 C) and heating rates. Analyses of the major element composition of the inclusions will be carried out via electron microprobe; trace element compositions will be determined using laser inductively coupled mass spectrometry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy will be used to verify CO2 and H2O compositions of large inclusions; and the ion microprobe and micro-Raman spectroscopy will be used to analyze CO2, H2O, S, and Mg. The proposed experiments that will be carried out will determine the mechanisms by which volatiles are lost from inclusions during transport in the crust or during experimental heating via process such as diffusion, formation of bubbles, and leakage through cracks in the crystal.

A cyclone tracking scheme will be applied to reanalyses, yielding an inventory of Arctic cyclone locations, tracks, and intensities that will provide a framework for analysis of ice and upper-ocean responses to storms. The responses of ice concentration, ocean temperature and salinity, and associated ice mass balance before, during, and after cyclones at a variety of intensities will be documented. The same analysis will be applied&#8232;to output from the high-resolution Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and to output from&#8232;a suite of global climate models (GCMs).

This project asks how and why individuals differ in their performance of complex displays and the consequences of that variation. Research focuses on the complex, acrobatic displays of a small, tropical bird, the lance-tailed manakin. Researchers will analyze continuously recorded video of display sites to determine how the courtship performance of males is influenced by female preferences. Analyses will quantify fine-scale variation in complex displays and determine how courtship performance affects reproductive success. Undergraduate mentoring is an essential aspect of this research program, and will promote opportunities for minority students. Findings will be disseminated to the public through informal presentations, published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at international conferences.<br/><br/>Motor performance (the execution of visible body movements) is an integral component of many courtship displays and has the potential to be an important signal of male quality. The whole organism is used in the execution of such movements, which involve factors such as respiration, muscular capacity, and current energy reserves; therefore, motor performance may be an even more valuable signal than static traits more commonly investigated in sexual selection studies. In lekking species, mate choice by females is expected to depend on which males she observes. Therefore, it is important to quantify phenotypic variation among the particular subset of males among which each female is choosing. This research will investigate the causes of variation in the performance of complex, acrobatic displays in the lance-tailed manakin, and the fitness consequences of that variation, specifically addressing three key questions: 1) What factors influence variation in display performance? 2) How does male display performance influence female choice? and 3) How do males choose which female to direct their displays toward when multiple females are present? This research utilizes advances in video technology to quantify fine-scale variation in complex courtship displays. Researchers will employ genetic techniques to determine how display performance and female visitation patterns relate to genetic siring success. Understanding what causes variation in motor displays is the first essential step in disentangling complex courtship displays and how these displays may influence fitness. All data associated with this research will be archived at Florida State University for a minimum of 5 years following project completion.","teal"

There is a general sense that modern societies are more insulated than pre-industrial societies from the effects of climate change, but this may not prove to be true. Developing a more complete understanding of how natural and human-caused changes affected the environment in the past can potentially guide decisions aimed at promoting future sustainability. Physical scientists often view abrupt changes in past climate as the primary cause for societal collapse; however, social scientists argue that sociopolitical decisions contribute to environmental change, and we should not study societal vulnerability without including an analysis of social structures. This project will integrate paleoenvironmental reconstruction with socioeconomic history to identify linkages between social and environmental change associated with climate variability. The research team includes paleoecologists, geologists, social historians and archeologists who will investigate a site near Rome, Italy that has been continuously utilized for over 2,300 years. The team will analyze medieval literature and property maps preserved in the archives of local monasteries, municipalities and the Vatican to obtain written ""eye-witness accounts"" of landscape change to help reconstruct the socioeconomic history of the region. In addition, the team will analyze physical evidence from lake sediments, including forest history from pollen, flood and erosion history from paleomagnetism and sediments, lake history from diatoms, temperature from oxygen isotopes, and fire history from charcoal analysis. By comparing the timing of significant environmental changes in the paleoenvironmental reconstruction to the timing of social history from written records the team will be able to suggest whether environmental change was caused by humans, by climate, or some complicated interaction of the two. In cases when climate change appears to have resulted in socioeconomic collapse, the research team will explore different models of socio-political structures that influenced how the local population was able to respond to the crisis.<br/><br/>Insights from this work will contribute to our understanding of actions that may guide policy decisions that better prepare communities for sustaining their local environment when faced with climatic change. The project will contribute to K-12 education by providing professional development to high school teachers of science, history and social studies. These teachers will create cross-disciplinary lesson plans that meet science curriculum standards and be disseminated to educators throughout the country using the Nevada Data Portal. Three graduate students will be supported while they earn advanced degrees in Geography (PhD), Geological Sciences (PhD) and Education (MA). These students will gain international experience, working with Italian researchers and graduate students. Six undergraduate students will also be supported as well as one early career female research scientist. This project will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups by both recruiting students from these groups, as well as working with high schools in communities with large populations of underrepresented groups. This project will advance scientific knowledge by creating a high resolution record of environmental change in the heart of the Roman Empire, a region that has been central to advances in western culture for thousands of years.","maroon"

The list of key biochemical ""gatekeepers"" for activation of the reproductive system from fishes to humans includes two important protein hormones, Gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin, that function in the brain. This project would investigate how social cues affect these hormones in the brain of an animal model system that is particularly powerful for revealing connections between the social environment and the reproductive system. This animal model is the bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), a fish species that has been the subject of many foundational studies of environmental influences on reproductive function. This project will use molecular neurobiology methods to map the gonadotropin-releasing hormone and kisspeptin signaling systems in the brain of the bluehead wrasse, in order to compare the expression of these hormones across different reproductive phases, and to test the effects of manipulating these hormones on reproductive function. A key element of the project is to provide undergraduates from North Carolina State University and Indian River State College in Florida with experience in behavioral field studies and molecular biological laboratory studies. A second benefit will be an increased understanding of the control of reproduction in fishes because the bluehead wrasse is a particularly useful animal for understanding the specific mechanisms of this control. This knowledge is valuable to the aquaculture industry because the control of reproduction represents a key barrier to the propagation of fishes in captivity. Finally, this project will lead to the development of educational materials focused on Florida marine environments in collaboration with the Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence.

This project seeks to further all of these objectives with an innovative program that capitalizes on her experience with one of the most exciting new tools in geology: ""clumped"" isotopes. Specifically the project will (i) reconstruct terrestrial climates during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~23,000-19,000 years ago), and (ii) work to educate, recruit, and retain a diverse population to the geosciences.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The project builds on the PI's recent work and describes a program termed CLUMPMAP that uses sedimentary archives to study LGM environmental change and promotes diversity in the geosciences. Changes in temperature from the LGM to recent have been studied to constrain how climate can respond to relative well-constrained forcings and as a result geologic data from LGM deposits provides valuable benchmarks for climate models. Over the next five years, the team will apply clumped isotope thermometry to carbonates and study LGM paleoclimate. This powerful new geothermometer uses the latest technology in gas-source mass spectrometry and is based on measuring the temperature-dependent 'clumping of 13C and 18O bonds in carbonate minerals. Temperature estimates also allow us to unravel the longstanding Gordian knot of carbonate 18O/16O (d18O) signatures and isolate fluid d18O. Reconstructions will be compared to climate model simulations in a manner analogous to what the PI has previously done in published studies. Thus results will provide insights into past climate variations and the processes driving them, and will be used to test the accuracy of physical representations of climate in models. Hypotheses from her recent work will be tested, focusing on role of tropospheric structure and planetary-scale atmospheric dynamics in determining the sensitivity of tropical and monsoonal climates to LGM forcings. An important aspect of this work will be assessing the reliability of model predictions of climate states that are substantially different than present.<br/><br/>Broader impacts include: 1. Supporting the PI in expanding an integrated program of research and education, developing CLUMPMAP into a community effort and resource; 2. furthering the training and educational/career development of student and early career scientists from under-represented groups, strengthening their qualifications to continue on in higher education; 3. providing these groups with resources to conduct research with a cutting-edge technique; 4. engaging and training early career scientists and students in outreach; 5. enhancing the recruitment and retention of bright people from diverse backgrounds through the provision of role models and mentorship; 6. advancing knowledge and appreciation of geosciences amongst young people, their parents, and their teachers; 7. establishing more role models that can and should improve the present culture for under-represented groups in many institutions; 8. furthering scientific understanding of deep-time (pre-Holocene) Earth systems in areas that are relevant to improving climate models; 9. developing new collaborations with international experts and promoting the engagement and training of U.S. students and junior researchers in research, through fieldwork and collaborative visits; 10. support of a NSF- and state-funded analytical facility the PI has built; and 11. facilitating the dissemination of this technique in the fields of sedimentary geology and paleoclimate.","hot_pink"

When empowered with data interrogation algorithms, such systems can provide critical damage assessment information to first responders immediately after an extreme event and can greatly facilitate the recovery process. This research investigates a new methodology for post-event structural damage assessment, using wireless sensors, through the following tasks: (a) design a novel direct residual displacement sensing unit, (b) develop new and identify existing damage algorithms suitable for embedding in sensing nodes, (c) embed the damage detection algorithms on the microprocessor of the sensing nodes, (d) calibrate the algorithms with available data from previous laboratory or numerical experiments, and (e) verify their predictive capabilities though three payload experiments on projects using the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities and Japan's E-Defense shake table. The payload experiments will use the multi-story reinforced concrete frame to be tested at the E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Japan, the full scale unibody light wood-frame structure test to be conducted at the NEES shake table facility at the University of California, San Diego, and the unbounded post-tensioned rocking wall test to be conducted at the NEES shake table facility at the University of Nevada, Reno.

The pilot proved the viability of the technique, which makes use of ringed seals who spend the majority of their time in such fjords and who may be appropriately equipped with integrated, location-tracking, CTD, and satellite communication instrumentation. The observations, which will be collected in partnership with colleagues at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, will be archived in national data bases, on a project website, and made widely available to others in near real-time. This project will address a currently missing, critical component of the Arctic Observing Network, namely observations of ocean temperatures and salinities along the periphery of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The methodology will lead to a practical, sustainable data stream for hydrographic properties in the notoriously difficult to access regions of the Greenland inner fjords, thus further filling out the overall Arctic Observing Network data portfolio. Such observations are needed to develop improved physics that can subsequently be directly used in IPCC class, coupled climate models. The data collection will also be of immense value to researchers studying the behavior of the ringed seals in Greenland. Virtually no behavioral data exists for these seals in the ice-ocean fjords, and the project data can be used to learn about the habitat and distribution of the seals, and ultimately of their possible vulnerability to climate change.","plum"

Satellite remote-sensing, regional climate modeling and nonlinear analysis techniques will be used to: assess variability of observed surface melt occurrence; benchmark model-based melt proxies versus observed melt; diagnose synoptic-scale meteorological/sea-ice controls on melt; and assess future change in melt proxies based on regional models driven by CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) general circulation models (GCMs). Understanding surface melt on polar ice sheets is important because surface melt affects albedo, can produce useful paleoclimatic records, contributes to mass balance through runoff, and is a trigger for ice-shelf collapse leading to ice-flow acceleration and sea-level rise. Improved understanding of the synoptic-meteorological causes of melting, and of the ability of state-of-the-art models to simulate melting accurately, would help assess the effects of future warming on melting, ice-sheet flow and sea level rise. The investigators propose three main research themes to help address these issues: (1) regional-atmospheric-model skill assessments and diagnosis of present synoptic controls on surface melt; (2) application of results from the model skill assessments to GCM-based climate scenarios for estimates of future change; and (3) expanding satellite-based retrieval of surface melt state characterization through retrieval of melt magnitude using a novel fusion of passive microwave and optical/thermal satellite data. In addition to addressing key questions relating Greenland ice sheet balance to sea-level change, the project includes outreach to the public, primarily through a web site, and numerous educational impacts.

Yet, with only a very few exceptions, little is known about the how these firms evolve. This project uses a novel data collection method -- extracting information from the Internet archiving website, ""The Wayback Machine,"" which since 1996 has periodically visited websites and preserved them in searchable form -- to compile data from 600 VTEFs that made a public stock offering between 1996 and 2014 and 600 comparable VTEFs that did not complete a public offering during this period. Information about the names and biographies of the management team, investors, scientific advisors, firm description, and location from ""The Wayback Machine"" will be combined with dates of venture capital funding and information from the Dataverse patent database to build histories of each firm. The result will be a comprehensive history of the composition of firm management teams, the firm's self-description, the headquarters' location, and evolving managerial roles of the founders as these firms are formed, receive venture capital, and, finally, fail, survive, or have an initial public offering of stock. <br/><br/>Firm growth is based upon the capabilities the founder(s) bring, those resources recruited from the environment (personnel, venture capital, etc.), and those assets built internally (patents etc.). With a few important exceptions, however, the dynamics of this firm-building process is largely a black box. The database that this project builds will open this black box. Among the topics to be examined are: When in the firm's evolution is the position of Chief Financial Officer filled? Is there a pattern to when key Top Management Team (TMT) members are added to the firm? When are founders replaced or are they relocated within the firm, e.g., from CEO to CTO? Do TMT and Board of Director changes vary by technology, region, or by fate of the firm, e.g., acquisition, bankruptcy, or IPO? Recently, public policy debates have wondered why women are under-represented in entrepreneurial firms. This project allows gender identification of all managers and board members for each firm. With this data, we can track gender issues from the firm's founding to an IPO or other liquidity event. The ability to address these empirical questions can test and improve current theories of entrepreneurial firm formation and growth.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The results of analysis of the data set will be valuable to venture capitalists and entrepreneurs seeking to understand and improve the performance of new firms. For policy-makers understanding the firm development process this project will provide social scientifically-informed insight into interventions meant to encourage the establishment and improve the growth of such firms. Finally, we anticipate scholars will use this data in ways that cannot be foreseen as it becomes a research input to other projects.","aquamarine"

Snakes can rapidly increase the size of their digestive tracts and hearts, and have evolved injectable venoms that immobilize and digest their prey, however we lack detailed analyses of diet for even many widespread, common species. This project will gather and synthesize ~7500 diet records on 66 species in eight major lineages, and then analyze seasonal, size-related, and geographic variation in each species' diet. Statistical comparisons will then be used to infer evolutionary and ecological diet patterns among species, as well as to explore potential biomedical and conservation implications.

The project will generate an up-to-date compilation of Delta14C records with associated uncertainty estimates. Transit time distribution (TTD) calculations will be applied to these records to relate deepwater Delta14C concentrations to those in surface waters.

Stanford University anthropologist, Dr. Sharika Thiranagama, will address this question through an investigation into the micro-processes through which ideological affiliations are perpetuated in everyday sociality. The research will be conducted in the southern Indian state of Kerala. This is an appropriate site for the research because in 1957, Kerala saw the installation of the first ever democratically elected communist government and communist parties have been part of the ruling coalition ever since. Communism in Kerala has survived the collapse of the Soviet Union and the waning of the organized left in most of the world. This project addresses the question of why and how this has come about. While much research in the social sciences evaluates and measures political affiliation through the examination of electoral votes and formal institutions, Dr. Thiranagama will instead examine the percolating and pervasive effects of political ideologies through how they are manifested in everyday practices in the family and in public spaces. This project will both contribute to an understanding of how political ideology might persist by shaping non-political realms of people's lives and also to an understanding of the long afterlife of the communist movement outside of the Soviet, Chinese, and Eastern Europe Bloc.<br/><br/>The research will be carried out in Kerala in the districts of Palakkad and Kannur, both of which have long been communist strongholds. Dr. Thiranagama will focus on exemplary institutions: the public library system and the private ""communist family."" Both have been deeply implicated in the public and private promulgation of communism in Kerala. Kerala's unique library movement introduced reading rooms, mass literacy, deliberative political discussion and communism into everyday life. The ""communist family"" sought to reconfigure ethics and the practice of intimate life. Data will be gathered in two neighborhoods and with library users and staff using a mixed methods approach, including interviews, participant observation, household surveys, and life history interviews. In addition, archival research will be undertaken to construct longitudinal social histories of the library and the family. Findings from this research will help to understand one of the enduring questions of modern times: how global ideologies are taken up and made to persist in ordinary people's daily lives.","maroon"

It refers to the interval, occurring roughly a million years ago, when the lengths of ice age cycles shifted from ~40,000 to 100,000 years and ice ages became more extreme. During the MPT, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) shifted significantly towards lower values, which would enhance climate cooling. Since the missing CO2 would have been stored in the ocean, it has been inferred that the decrease is a response to changes in the deep-ocean's circulation (also known as ""thermohaline circulation""). This shift in the mode of climate variability occurred without significant change in the system's energy inputs (i.e., astronomical forcing), thus implying that non-linear responses of the climate system and/or internal changes within the ocean-atmosphere-cryosphere were ultimately responsible. This research will help quantify the interaction between deep-ocean circulation, the carbon cycle, and global climate change during this critical climatic period. Because the pre-MPT reflects a climate state characterized by elevated glacial atmospheric CO2 and smaller ice sheets, improving understanding of this transition will help scientists and policy makers to better predict and prepare for predicted high atmospheric CO2 levels in the future.<br/><br/>Specifically, this research explores geological archives of past deep-ocean circulation and carbonate chemistry to help elucidate the history of ocean circulation and CO2 over the MPT. The work applies novel geochemical proxies (Nd isotopes, B isotopes and B/Ca ratios) to (1) reconstruct and quantify thermohaline circulation and CO2 changes in the deep-ocean and (2) apply these indicators to establish the nature and timing of this major climatic transition. Using sediment cores from different water depths in the northern, tropical, and south Atlantic will allow the research team to track lateral and vertical changes in the thermohaline circulation before, during and after the MPT. The Nd isotope data will complement the published benthic carbon stable isotope data, which also reflect thermohaline circulation but are also affected by biology (productivity), air-sea equilibration and changes in the global carbon budget. The project will also investigate deep-ocean CO2 storage by estimating seawater-pH and carbonate saturation from boron isotopes and B/Ca ratios in benthic foraminifers. Paired analysis of these proxies provides the opportunity to address the hypothesis that deep-ocean circulation facilitated the coeval drawdown of atmospheric pCO2 during glacial periods, which in turn enhanced high-latitude ice sheet growth, and established the boundary conditions for the development of 100-kyr cycles.

Understanding the range of variability will help to improve climate models that are used to simulate the region's response to a range of abrupt and long term changes in temperature, wind circulation patterns, and moisture sources. In addition, understanding the past climate conditions of the region will allow a better understanding of the regional plant and animal populations and interactions, as well as changes in the human cultures of the area.

The proposed research builds on previous NSF-supported work in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, which are a major center of action in the summer monsoon system and a primary gateway for moisture entering the Tibetan Plateau. Results from previous work demonstrate that lakes in the region contain Holocene-length sediment archives which can be dated with radiometric techniques. These lakes also have decadal sedimentation rates and contain a diverse range of climate proxies that capture both local and synoptic monsoon variability. The team will reconstruct local monsoon variability with physical sedimentology and geochemistry, and synoptic variability with hydrogen isotope measurements on terrestrial leaf waxes. The results will be synthesized with paleoclimate records from the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding region, as well as with records from key regions in the global climate system, like the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic, to address three central questions: (i) How did Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall vary on decadal timescales during the Holocene? (ii) Is there evidence for an Indian Summer Monsoon response to changing global climate boundary conditions during the middle Holocene at ~5300 years before present?

They will performe a Seismic Risk Assessment of Wind Turbine Towers in the Zafarana Wind Farm in Egypt. The Zafarana wind farm in 2012 was generating a capacity of 517MW, making it one of the largest onshore wind farms in the world. It is located in an active seismic zone along the west side of the Gulf of Suez. An extension of the wind farm southward is under consideration for construction in the near future. Seismic risk assessment is needed to assess the structural integrity of wind towers under expected seismic hazard events in this location, and this risk assessment procedure is likely to be valuable whenever wind turbines are located in a potentially active seismic region. The project objective is to pursue interdisciplinary studies to define seismic risk and seismic loads via a range of seismic analyses that are coupled with measured structural values in the field. The ultimate goal is to define and improve seismic design of wind turbine structures.<br/><br/>Wind turbines are unique structures. They are tall, slender and flexible and susceptible to dynamic loads. In addition, they are operating/moving structures as compared to buildings or bridges which are stationary. As alternative energy sources such as wind become more important globally, we will continue to have more wind turbine structures; therefore, pursuing research for these structures is important and broadly relevant. This international project combines a team of scientists, engineers, students and researchers from two countries. The diverse expertise of the two teams is a strength of the research effort and the cultural exchange between them is an important broader impact of this project. The research will be integrated into several facets of the structural and geotechnical engineering programs at the participating institutes. Results of this study will be of relevance to similar projects in the Middle East, as well as in other seismically active regions worldwide. Graduate and undergraduate students from the US and from Egypt will participate in the research, which ranges from numerical modeling of structure and soil structure interaction of wind turbine towers to the practical aspects of conducting a field investigation and instrumentation, thus providing a well-rounded education for the participants. In this regard, students from STEM under-represented communities will be actively recruited. Additionally, the international/intercultural collaborative aspects of the proposed research will provide a unique experience for those involved.<br/><br/>The proposed seismological studies, geo technical studies for loads, dynamic field measurements, and structural seismic analyses of existing wind towers will greatly enhance the associated design recommendations and provide strong intellectual merit for this project. The actual estimated site loads can be applied to the new towers that will be located in the same zone. The new wind turbine ambient vibration datasets to be acquired at Zafarana will constitute a basis for calibration of analysis tools for studies elsewhere. This data will be professionally archived and made available for use by interested researchers and practitioners worldwide. Valuable recommendations will be deduced for provisions in design codes based on realistic data and detailed structural assessments of the wind turbines. <br/><br/>This project is funded through the US-Egypt Joint Science and Technology Fund Program. Support for the U.S. side of these cooperative projects is provided to the National Science Foundation by the U.S. Department of State. The Egyptian Government provides support for the Egyptian side of the collaboration.","chartreuse"

This research will investigate the variability of the monsoon by sampling bottom sediments from four lakes high in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, which are believed to hold a record stretching back well over 6000 years into the past. Understanding the range of variability will help to improve climate models that are used to simulate the region's response to a range of abrupt and long term changes in temperature, wind circulation patterns, and moisture sources. In addition, understanding the past climate conditions of the region will allow a better understanding of the regional plant and animal populations and interactions, as well as changes in the human cultures of the area. This work will strengthen international scientific relationships between U.S. and Chinese scientific institutions, scientists, and students. Support will be provided for two earlier career scientists, a Ph.D. student and undergraduate students. The research team will collaborate with the Center for Earth and Environmental Sciences in Indiana to develop a new outreach module for 4th to 9th graders that will raise the awareness of issues surrounding water resources locally in Indianapolis, IN, and the United States as well as in the monsoon region.<br/><br/>This research will investigate Indian summer monsoon variability during the Holocene with decadally resolved sediment records from four alpine lakes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The proposed research builds on previous NSF-supported work in the Nyainqentanglha Mountains, which are a major center of action in the summer monsoon system and a primary gateway for moisture entering the Tibetan Plateau. Results from previous work demonstrate that lakes in the region contain Holocene-length sediment archives which can be dated with radiometric techniques. These lakes also have decadal sedimentation rates and contain a diverse range of climate proxies that capture both local and synoptic monsoon variability. The team will reconstruct local monsoon variability with physical sedimentology and geochemistry, and synoptic variability with hydrogen isotope measurements on terrestrial leaf waxes. The results will be synthesized with paleoclimate records from the Tibetan Plateau and surrounding region, as well as with records from key regions in the global climate system, like the tropical Pacific and the North Atlantic, to address three central questions: (i) How did Indian Summer Monsoon rainfall vary on decadal timescales during the Holocene? (ii) Is there evidence for an Indian Summer Monsoon response to changing global climate boundary conditions during the middle Holocene at ~5300 years before present? (iii) Did the Medieval Climate Anomaly and Little Ice Age discernibly influence Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation?","hot_pink"

One way for water managers to address these water supply issues is by transferring water from one use or area to another. This project analyzes the policies, practices, and consequences of water transfers by examining the social, legal, and environmental contexts and consequences of moving water from rural agricultural uses to urban areas. In particular, the research focuses on the idea of 'wastefulness.' A key goal of water transfers is reducing inefficient or wasteful use of water -- but waste is a socially created idea with different meanings for different groups. For the communities of people and wildlife that depend upon those so-called wasteful uses of water, a water transfer may jeopardize their lives and livelihoods. The broad impacts of this research lie in its close examination of the social and environmental justice implications of defining certain water flows as wasteful.<br/><br/>This work contributes to multiple bodies of literature including political ecology, nature/society geography, and socio-legal studies. The study investigates water transfers and ideas of wastefulness using the following three research questions: 1) What competing discourses and narratives around water's waste and value have been produced, by whom, in relation to water transfers, and how have different claims asserted by (or on behalf of) human and nonhuman water users been framed as legitimate or illegitimate in these discourses? 2) How have legal institutions been used, and by whom, to validate wasteful or valuable uses of water and the legitimacy of different water users' claims? 3) How have impacts of water transfers on source areas including changes to air quality, wildlife habitat, and livelihoods, been framed and experienced by different groups? The project focuses on California, an area with a long history of conflict around water use. The research uses a comparative case study approach to examine three cases of highly contested rural-to-urban water transfers at three lakes in California -- Owens Lake, Mono Lake, and the Salton Sea. The cases share many physical similarities, but represent distinct and pivotal moments in the history of water management, revealing both change and stability over time. Data sources include key informant interviews, archival data, and participant observation. By examining the discourses and processes of water re-allocation, this study builds a better understanding of how ideas and legal structures shaping California water policy have evolved over time. The study will have generalizable conclusions for other arid regions within and beyond the Southwestern U.S. struggling to allocate water supplies in a socially and environmentally just and sustainable manner.","maroon"

The objective of the Global CMT Project is to provide the best and most comprehensive record of global seismic strain release available. The basic earthquake parameters determined in a CMT analysis represent primary observations of the earthquake source process and provide valuable constraints for modeling and interpretation of global and regional tectonic activity. The CMT parameters allow description and prediction of global ground motion due to an earthquake. The CMT Catalog is the standard data base used in regional seismicity and tectonic studies, and the results are used in studies of stress changes and deformation due to earthquakes, as well as for research into complex and unusual seismic events, and for analyses of seismic hazard in the US and elsewhere. Educators at several levels integrate products from the CMT Project in a variety of activities. The CMT Project's current operational goal is to analyze all earthquakes with magnitudes greater than or equal to 5.0 occurring anywhere in the world. The results are disseminated via the project web site as well as by the IRIS Data Management Center and the International Seismological Centre; rapid analyses are also disseminated by email. <br/><br/>The work supported by this award involves five main activities: (1) Systematic determination, with a three-month delay, of moment tensors for earthquakes of magnitude 5.0 and larger globally, and archiving of the results in the CMT catalog; (2) Rapid determination of moment tensors for earthquakes of magnitude 5.5 and larger globally and quick dissemination of the results; (3) Curation of the CMT catalog and continued improvements of the distribution mechanisms for this data base; (4) Routine detection and location of seismic sources using surface waves and distribution of a catalog of detected events; (5) Investigations of the quality of seismic waveforms from the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) and other seismic networks.

Are they just demonstrating human resiliency and adaptability? Or are they also challenging the very idea of having a formal shared market and associated currency that do not correspond to the nation with which people identify? There is now a global movement towards greater economic integration, so these are important questions for all of us.<br/><br/>City University of New York doctoral student, Helen Panagiotopoulos, with the supervision of Dr. Ida Susser, will address these questions through 15 months of ethnographic research in Greece. Greece is an appropriate site for the research because in 2009, faced with debts it could not pay, the Greek government instituted austerity measures as a condition of obtaining outside financial assistance. The austerity measures were followed by economic depression, large increases in unemployment, and a widepsread shortage of money. In this context, people established a variety of currency alternatives to acquire the goods and services they needed to survive, without euros, the currency of their monetary union, the Eurozone. These alternative currencies include Local Exchange Trading Schemes, such as barter, time banking, and mutual credit clearing, and crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Free Coin. The researcher will carry out research in three sites, each of which is associated with a different alternative currency system. She will collect data through extended case analysis, interviews, participant observation, archival research, text analysis and analysis of online databases. Findings from this research will improve social scientific theory of the relationship between currencies, national sovereignty, and citizen allegiance. They will also be of interest to policy makers who need to understand how currencies shape social and political life and how people understand money and value.","maroon"

The research will undertake a synthesis of zooplankton and micronekton data collected from 1991 through 2008 as part of this program, specifically to investigate spatio-temporal variability on multiple scales and to test hypotheses on the underlying causes of the variability documented. Data include community composition, abundance and biomass, from net tows and bioacoustic transects; and life history information for both Antarctic krill and the salp (Salpa thompsoni), the biomass dominants for zooplankon > 2 mm. In addition, in situ rates of secondary production (growth, spawning and egg production) are available for the key species Antarctic krill. This zooplankton data set combined with the coherent multi-disciplinary data sets collected by the Palmer LTER is uniquely suited for studies of spatio-temporal variability and mechanisms underlying that variability, partially due to the fact that the time period spans three full cycles of recruitment in Antarctic krill and variability in primary production. Included are resources for multiple data base activities: completion of sample analysis and data submittal for the 0708 field season, interactions with the Palmer LTER information manager, and submittal to the LTER data directory of completed derived products as described above. Synthetic activities will formally establish collaborations with both national and international partners. In addition to published scientific articles, both raw and synthetic data will be archived with metadata. Such data are essential for ecosystem exploration, modeling efforts and ecosystem-based fisheries management underway in the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources.

In addition, algae predominated in late Paleozoic marine ecosystems. These observations, combined with predictions from climate modeling, prompt two over-arching hypotheses driving the proposed research: 1) the unusual tropical dustiness reflects dust production by tropical upland glaciers, and 2) atmospheric dustiness fertilized marine ecosystems. Dust forces the climate system by affecting radiative forcing and atmospheric moisture, and by influencing the biosphere, but these effects are poorly known. In this research, PIs will collect data to constrain spatial (low-mid latitude) and temporal (glacial-interglacial and longer) variations in atmospheric 'dustiness,' sources of the dust, and influences between dust and ecosystem composition in order to address their over-arching hypotheses, and clarify the relationships among atmospheric dustiness, climate, and the biosphere.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This research will reveal process links among dust, climate, and the biosphere within an icehouse, at glacial-interglacial scales. Owing to the known importance but great uncertainty of both the direct and indirect effects of dust on climate, results will expand understanding of Earth-system behavior. Tropical glaciation at low elevations implies much more widespread glaciation than currently accepted, and --if verified-- would force the community to test this hypothesis with new modeling approaches. The models to be used are identical to those used for present and future climate, and thus improvements made through the proposed work will inform modeling of Earth's climate in general. If the hypothesis that atmospheric dustiness forced marine biotic systems toward nutrient-rich conditions is confirmed, it implies a remarkably dusty Earth, and clarifies Earth-system behavior to dust-sourced fertilization. These results are relevant to growing discussions regarding geo-engineering schemes to control future climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Cross-disciplinary training will occur via exchanges between geological and geochemical labs, geologists and modelers, and in joint field excursions and progress meetings. PhD students will mentor middle-school teachers through a formal summer program. Undergraduates will conduct senior theses and present at Undergraduate Research Day and national meetings. Both will interact with middle- and high-school students through a formal course on STEM education. The lead investigators will use components of the research to teach at university levels, as well as in museum, and community outreach. Ties will be established and strengthened among all participant institutions, which includes an Historically Black University, as well as international partners.

Instead, researchers have attended more to male deficits, recognizing men for the damages they impart via their absence or harmful behaviors rather than for any positive contributions they might make within the family. This gap in knowledge is problematic because it impedes the development of effective and culturally appropriate post-conflict and post-trauma interventions to promote family well-being, provide for child health and resilience, and prevent the intergenerational transmission of violence that might feed future conflicts. Therefore, Yale University doctoral student Kristen McLean, under the supervision of Dr. Catherine Panter-Brick, will undertake research to address this issue.<br/><br/>The researcher has chosen the Kono District of Sierra Leone as an appropriate site to investigate the post-conflict and post-trauma family roles of younger men. This is an appropriate site because the region was particularly devastated by the country's 1991-2002 civil war and has also been affected by the Ebola epidemic. The researcher's overarching research question is: does extreme adversity shape young men's masculinity, fatherhood experiences, and family well-being? She will gather data using a variety of anthropological methods, including: participant observation, semi-structured interviews, the administration of standard scales to assess mental health and resilience, the collection of life history narratives, and analysis of archival materials. Findings from this research will deepen understanding of what it means to be a man in a context of debilitating poverty and public health crisis, identifying key challenges young men face as well as resources they rely upon as they assume traditional older adult parenting roles. Study findings also will advance social science theory of masculinity, fatherhood, and resilience, adding to theoretical debates on gender, family well-being, and the role of fathers in child development.","maroon"

To achieve these goals, this research has five main phases: (1) design, build and test baseline numerical and small-scale experimental models of the isolated structure to be tested on the NIED E-Defense shake table; (2) derive analytical and numerical approaches to guarantee the conditions of stability of RTHS, as well as fully develop the computational techniques that exploit the localized nature of the physical components in RTHS for highly efficient simulation of large-scale numerical models for RTHS; (3) participate in E-Defense's 2015 controllable damping base isolation experiment, working with Japanese collaborators to develop suitable control strategies and assist with the challenging aspects of their experiment; (4) use the models and tools already developed, and the experience and data from the full-scale E-Defense tests, in RTHS at the University of Connecticut to demonstrate the advances in RTHS capabilities; and (5) engage the research community by designing and releasing a benchmark study in controlled isolation based on the E-Defense and U.S.-designed structures, and by a workshop to solicit community feedback about the tools and future directions of RTHS studies. Smart base isolation is a promising seismic mitigation technique that supplements a building's conventional base isolation layer with controllable energy dissipation devices that allow for seismic protection over a range of different earthquakes. This mitigation technique is now ready for full-scale experimental verification and validation: Japanese collaborators at the NIED E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Japan, are planning experiments in 2015 of a full-scale base isolated building with controllable dampers in the isolation layer to mitigate damage and injury, particularly for strong impulsive and long-period excitation. Full-scale dynamic earthquake engineering experiments, while vital for advancing seismic protection, are limited by the few facilities with the capacity to conduct the experiments and by the associated high cost of testing. These large-scale earthquake engineering experiments can be leveraged with a wider array of real-time hybrid simulations (RTHS), which combines physical testing of the critical components linked with physics-based computational model simulations of the remaining structure. RTHS must be calibrated to the full-scale results to ensure accuracy (and credibility), must be capable of accommodating, in real-time, the large-scale computational models vital to precise response computation for complex structures, and must be guaranteed stable and robust.<br/><br/>This research will enable new technologies for seismic hazard mitigation and hybrid computational/experimental tools that complement, and broaden the applicability of, large-scale testing. Building technology will be advanced by demonstrating, in full-scale physical and mixed physical/virtual experiments, that controllable damping devices can provide significant reductions in building motion and damage during earthquakes - and doing so by capitalizing on experiments already planned by Japanese collaborators. Further, the project will enable the computational tools to support these cyber-physical experiments for realistic large-scale building models and ensure that the results are accurate. Beyond the collaboration with Japanese researchers, the development of a controllable base isolation benchmark study using models calibrated to full-scale experimental results will engage a world-wide community of researchers to multiply the reach of this project through numerous alternate control strategies. The research results will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate classes at the University of Southern California and the University of Connecticut. An industry advisory panel will be assembled to ensure that the knowledge of practicing engineers informs the research. A workshop will ensure the transfer of the resulting tools to the hybrid simulation community so that others can take full advantage of the research results from this project.

The efforts under this proposal are relevant to applications involving large and distributed amounts of data, as is the case with health informatics, surveillance applications, data networks, or cloud computing. The research results will enable engineering systems to benefit from a bottom-up design paradigm involving coordination among less powerful agents to achieve higher levels of cognition and performance by an interconnected network of cooperating agents. The research will develop techniques that enable agents to work collectively for a common objective and to counter the degrading effect of imbalances that may exist in their interactions such as the fact that some agents in the network may be more informed than other agents; some agents may have a domineering tendency; some agents may be willing to share only partial information due to privacy and secrecy considerations; and some agents may be subject to corrupted data; or have different objectives than the group. Results developed under this work will benefit the training of a diverse body of students in the strategic area of network science. The results will also be disseminated broadly to the research community online and in archival publications and meetings.<br/><br/>Performance indicators in networked applications include cooperation among agents to bestow resilience to failure; privacy and secrecy considerations where agents may not be comfortable sharing data with remote centers for processing; and the fact that large amounts of data may already be available in dispersed form and aggregation of the data at a central location can be costly. These considerations have motivated the development of powerful distributed mechanisms that enable agents to cooperate to attain superior inference capabilities. Many distributed techniques ignore critical asymmetries that exist in both network and data structures. Robotic swarms are one example of a notable application where agents can benefit from adjusting their exploration space in response to asymmetry conditions, malfunctioning of neighbors, or suspicious behavior by intruders. A second example is the use of networked learners to mine information from big databases, such as those related to health informatics, power grids, social networks, or surveillance applications. If asymmetries are ignored, they can lead to erroneous inference conclusions and degraded performance. This research effort exploits cognitive abilities to enable networks to counter asymmetries and their deleterious effects. In particular, this project seeks adaptation and learning mechanisms that endow multi-agent systems with the ability to implement decision-making processes that mimic quorum responses by animal groups, the ability to identify and react to domineering or intrusive behavior, the ability to implement divide-and-conquer, clustering, and labor division strategies, and the ability to counter the effect of corrupted data.","ivory"

Improving the forecasts of blocking events and assessing how the frequency, severity, and location of such events may change with climate change are of substantial societal importance. Synoptic eddies have been shown to play a critical role in the dynamics of atmospheric blocking events by maintaining the blocking pattern but the understanding of their role is currently not sufficiently complete and quantitative. <br/><br/>The goals of the proposed research are 1) to improve the dynamical understanding of atmospheric blocking events through developing a quantitative assessment of synoptic-eddy forcing of blocks. 2) to employ this dynamical understanding to investigate how blocking events will change with climate change and how blocks can be better simulated in climate and weather models. The proposed research will employ numerical experiments with a hierarchy of general circulation models, reanalysis data, and archived results of full-physics general circulation models such as Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models. The research has three components: the first is to study the eddy-forcing mechanism using idealized modeling experiments which to isolate and develop a quantitative understanding of this mechanism. The same idealized framework will be used to investigate how the speed and latitude of jet streams, different patterns of quasi-stationary planetary waves, and moisture modulate this mechanism. The second component is to test this understanding using the reanalysis data and to gain further insight into the dynamic of observed blocking events. The third component is to apply this understanding to examine the performance of full-physics models in simulating blocking, and to provide a more reliable and conclusive prediction on how blocking events will change in the future.","fuchsia"

Changes in land use and land cover, such as deforestation for agriculture or pasture use, or forest regrowth after agricultural abandonment, affect the exchange of carbon between soils and the atmosphere, with implications for climate and soil fertility. Past human activities can influence the quantity and dynamics of carbon in soils. Despite this, and the fact that an increasing proportion of the Earth's surface is covered by human-modified landscapes, few regional-scale assessments of soil carbon incorporate historical land use. This project will focus on how historical and environmental factors affect how much carbon is stored in tropical soils and its vulnerability to disturbance. Tropical regions are experiencing dynamic changes in land cover and increasing human population growth, yet our understanding of how tropical soils respond to global change is limited to few soil environments which are not representative of the global tropics. The proposed field research will take place in the U.S. Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a model system to study interactions between environmental and human factors in the tropics because it represents a diversity of climatic regions, ecosystem and soil types. The proposed educational activities will provide students with interdisciplinary research and career skills training and field experience and will increase participation of underrepresented communities in geography and the geosciences, in particular women and Hispanic students. Collaborations with agency scientists will facilitate broad dissemination of research results to managers and policymakers. <br/><br/>This project aims to measure legacy effects of past human activities on tropical soil carbon dynamics by taking advantage of an extraordinary natural laboratory in Puerto Rico with a rich diversity of geologic substrates, precipitation gradients, and well-documented land-use history. The project will quantify carbon storage (amount and turnover) under different land uses across environmental gradients with a long history of human management through the collection of new data and integration of archived data to increase the geographic representation of tropical soil environments. The project will evaluate the magnitude and persistence of historical land use legacy effects on soil carbon with time across different soil types using carbon isotope depth profiles and field chronosequences. Improved mechanistic understanding of the effects of soil type, climate and land use on soil organic matter retention to will be accomplished through physical fractionation approaches that investigate the sensitivity of different soil carbon pools to disturbance and the use of natural abundance radiocarbon isotopes to measure carbon storage effectiveness. The research and educational activities will provide students with training in field, lab, geospatial and data analysis skills. The integration of research and educational activities will create new opportunities for collaborations between social and physical scientists, especially through the development of a mixed-methods field course focused on environmental challenges in human-dominated tropical landscapes.","maroon"

However, when we look more closely at actual commodity movements, a wide range of local actors comes into view. These include traders and trading communities who move goods and capital across surprisingly vast distances. Yet researchers who study global capitalism have tended to overlook the contemporary significance of such actors, assuming that because they may depend on kinship, community, and regional networks for commerce, their ability to affect global markets is limited. Recently, however, new evidence suggests that this assumption may be based on a false division between economic and social life and thus blind social scientists to the true importance of traditional traders and trading communities. To investigate this possibility, the research supported by this award will investigate several previously neglected questions. What relationships are there between local practicies and international commodity trade? Is contemporary commerce connected to historical trading networks? Are connections of kinship, friendship, and obligation important in modulating flows of goods across changing international regimes of regulation and taxation? And, given that traders are often key social as well as economic intermediaries, how might their activities affect relationships during and after periods of war and political stress?<br/><br/>To pursue these question, Stanford University anthropology doctoral student, Nethra Samarawickreama, supervised by Dr. Sharika Thiranagama, will undertake research on an Indian Ocean trading community. Because of the complexity of the questiions, the research site needs to be relatively bounded in order to be able to observe the economic micro-processes at work. Therefore, she has chosen to focus on the gold and gem trade in Sri Lanka, which has historically been dominated by family businesses that function locally and transnationally, do so across lines of ethnic difference, and have sustained economic relationships before, during, and after Sri Lanka's recent civil war. She will complement the Sri Lanka-based portion of her investigation with research in Singapore, where South Indian businessmen recirculate Sri Lankan goods throughout the Indian Ocean. To gather data, the researcher will use multiple social science research methods, including: participant observation, semi-structured interviews, the elicitation of family histories, and archival research. First, she will examine traders' discourses of trust to understand how trading families constitute themselves, access credit, build reputations, engage in philanthropy, and forge far-reaching relations of dependency. Secondly, she will seek to conceptualize traders' local relations through frames wider than the nation and situate them in transnational commercial networks. Thirdly, she will seek to understand how ethnic attachments and differences may coexist with enduring inter-ethnic commercial exchanges despite conflict and its aftermaths. Findings from this research will contribute significantly to understanding the relationship between local socioeconomic systems and global trade, as well as opening up new arenas for developing policies to faciliate peaceful co-existence in post-conflict situations.","maroon"

NCALM is a collaborative Facility with two nodes. The acquisition node and initial flight line trajectory calculations and ALSM data calibration functions are now located and performed at the University of Houston (UH) and the data processing, archival and distribution node is at the University of California at Berkeley (UC-B). Also known as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), ALSM allows for the measurement of surface topographic features with decimeter-level accuracies and meter to sub-meter spatial resolution. High resolution, georeferenced, digital elevation models (DEMs) processed from raw ALSM data (point clouds) offer unprecedented observations of a multitude of geomorphic features at the scales at which fundamental shaping processes operate. Examples include, fault scarps, hill slopes, river channels, barrier beaches and sand dunes, mountain and continental glaciers, volcanic edifices and vegetative canopy structure. DEMs developed from ALSM can be used to model and advance understanding of the dynamics of surface landforms and the underlying processes responsible. The technique also has a wide range of applications in civil engineering and hazards assessments and for archaeological investigations of past civilizations modification of landscapes, especially in tropical environs where such structures are invisible via airborne photogrammetry. ALSM systems fire laser pulses (typically Nd:YAG at milliJoule powers) at high frequency from an aircraft whose position and orientation are accounted for via on board and ground GPS control and an aircraft IMU. The ALSM system measures the round trip travel time for individual pulses to reflect off encountered surfaces and return to a detector. The intensity of returns is also recorded on the UH GEMINI system. Raw ALSM travel time data is combined with ground Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver phase data and aircraft GPS and IMU data to generate xyz georeferenced coordinates of each laser return from the surface or ?point clouds.? The GEMINI system?s high frequency laser postings allows for penetration of dense vegetative canopies and, with developed post processing routines, can yield maps of both the upper surface of vegetative canopy and the bare Earth surface that is obstructed from a bird?s eye view. NCALM is dedicated to meeting three goals: 1) providing research-quality LiDAR data to the scientific community, 2) advancing the state of the art in airborne laser mapping, and 3) training and educating graduate students to meet the rapidly growing needs of academia, government, and the private sector. <br/><br/>***","hot_pink"

The Northern Hemisphere was largely ice-free 4 myr ago followed by an acceleration of global temperature decline at ~3.6 myr ago, with continental ice sheets developing on northern hemisphere continents by ~2.7 myr ago. Limited atmospheric CO2 records suggest a decline in CO2 from ~400 to ~300 parts per million by volume (ppmv) during that time period could have cooled the Earth sufficiently to enable ice sheets to grow. Yet the cause for this decline in CO2 remains unknown. This international research and educational collaboration between 7 U.S. and 3 Chinese institutions will evaluate a new hypothesis: atmospheric dust derived from Central Asian deserts fertilized the North Pacific ocean, stimulating algal productivity, which in turn drew down atmospheric CO2 leading to Northern Hemisphere Glaciation (NHG). Through field work studies in China, laboratory analyses of ocean and terrestrial sedimentary deposits, and atmospheric and ocean modeling studies, the investigators and students will generate and compare a wide range of paleoclimate records from diverse geological archives to evaluate the role of atmospheric dust in CO2 decline and global cooling at the onset of NHG. The findings from this research project may ultimately contribute to knowledge with global policy implications.<br/><br/>By evaluating the significance of atmospheric dust in sustaining cool climate conditions on Earth, this study is expected to elucidate the mechanisms of climate cooling in the recent geologic past. Specifically this study will establish records of: 1) the aridification history of Central Asia, northern Tibet, and the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) as related to records of deformation and surface uplift in high Asia within and to the west of these regions, 2) wind erosion of Central Asia basins and dust accumulation in the CLP, 3) dust flux, algal productivity, and sea surface temperature in the North Pacific and South Atlantic, and 4) terrestrial CO2 in the interval of 4.5-2.5 Ma. Modeling and sensitivity studies will (1) evaluate the sensitivity of Asian climate and the dust cycle to the growth of topography and to the background global climate; (2) determine the amount of cooling that could result from Pliocene dust transport to the North Pacific; (3) evaluate the potential influence of Asian dust on atmospheric CO2. Through this research program, US graduate students will gain access to research facilities as well as field localities in China that would otherwise be inaccessible and engage in mutually beneficial collaborative research activities with Chinese partners via bilateral visits; US undergraduate students will also have the opportunity to participate in summer schools, workshops, and research projects; the investigators will develop outreach tools for museums to increase public understanding of the role of atmospheric dust in climate change.","chartreuse"

RTHS must be calibrated to the full-scale results to ensure accuracy (and credibility), must be capable of accommodating, in real-time, the large-scale computational models vital to precise response computation for complex structures, and must be guaranteed stable and robust.<br/><br/>This research will enable new technologies for seismic hazard mitigation and hybrid computational/experimental tools that complement, and broaden the applicability of, large-scale testing. Building technology will be advanced by demonstrating, in full-scale physical and mixed physical/virtual experiments, that controllable damping devices can provide significant reductions in building motion and damage during earthquakes - and doing so by capitalizing on experiments already planned by Japanese collaborators. Further, the project will enable the computational tools to support these cyber-physical experiments for realistic large-scale building models and ensure that the results are accurate. Beyond the collaboration with Japanese researchers, the development of a controllable base isolation benchmark study using models calibrated to full-scale experimental results will engage a world-wide community of researchers to multiply the reach of this project through numerous alternate control strategies. The research results will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate classes at the University of Southern California and the University of Connecticut. An industry advisory panel will be assembled to ensure that the knowledge of practicing engineers informs the research. A workshop will ensure the transfer of the resulting tools to the hybrid simulation community so that others can take full advantage of the research results from this project. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.

It seeks to understand how and when workers are able increase their rights, even when they find little political support and have limited capacities within the workplace. The study asks three questions: (1) Why do some low wage workers use legal action while others use collective bargaining?, (2) When workers attempt collective bargaining why are some able to bring management to the bargaining table and others not?, and(3) If taking legal action, why do some workers attempt to use the law to expand their rights when others do not? <br/><br/>To answer these questions, the study compares six different cases of labor disputes and focuses on the role of management, state authorities, and non-governmental organizations working in labor (labor NGOs) in southern China. The data collection combines interviews with workers, attorneys, and non-government organizations associated with the cases with legal and organizational documents from archived files on each case, media reports and participant observation notes from court hearings and meetings with workers. It is expected that managers and firm-level factors will play a crucial role in workers' decisions to use legal action or attempt collective bargaining. State authorities are critical in the collective bargaining process, and their intervention enables some workers to bring management to the bargaining table. Finally, labor NGOs may guide some workers to use legal action to expand their rights; on the other hand, workers who do not engage with labor NGOs use the courtroom strictly for recovering material interests. This study will increase our knowledge of the contemporary industrial setting in China. Such knowledge will improve business and political relationships with China, leading to a more productive relationship to the advantage of all parties.","crimson"

More recently the techniques have been applied to arts, social, political and other fields less traditionally reliant on high performance computing. This innovation has grown out of realization some 20 years ago that I/O (input/output) support for high performance parallel and distributed architectures had lagged behind that of pure computational speed, and further that bring I/O up to speed was both critical, and a rather difficult problem. The core hurdle of contemporary I/O on large HPC machines relates to issues of latency in large parts caused by the deficiencies of the historical I/O model that was relevant when computers were exclusively large, centralized, single processor systems shared by many time-sharing programs. In order to improve I/O on scalability on future hardware architectures novel approaches are required.<br/><br/>This project is conducting research on an extension of ParalleX, a new highly innovative parallel execution model. The extension provides a powerful I/O interface that allows researchers to create highly efficient data management, discovery, and analysis codes for Big Data applications. This new extension, known as PXFS, is based on HPX, an implementation of ParalleX based on C++, and OrangeFS, a high performance parallel file system. The research goal driving PXFS is to extend HPX objects into I/O space so that the objects become persistent and storage becomes another class of memory, all accessed as a single virtual address space and managed by an event driven dynamic adaptive computation environment. Critical aspects of this approach include futures-based synchronization, dynamic locality management, dynamic resource management, hierarchical name space, and an active global address space (AGAS). The overall goals of PXFS are to eliminate the division of programming imposed by conventional file system through the unification of name spaces and their management, and to minimize global synchronization in order to support asynchronous concurrency. The research methodology is to implement a Map/Reduce application framework using PXFS and evaluate its effectiveness in both performance and ease of use.<br/><br/>This project is conducted at three major research universities involving undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, and high-school teachers and their students. The project includes a PI from the functional genomics field acting as domain science expert in order to focus the development efforts on real world problems. Graduate students and post-docs involved in the project are trained in these areas to promote scientists who understanding both aspects of Big Data problems. The project engages under represented minorities with the goal to inspire them to pursue a career in computer science or genomics.

These materials can not only produce electric signals under an applied electric field or a macroscopic shape deformation under an applied mechanical stress field but can also produce electric signals in response to an applied mechanical stress or a shape deformation in response to an applied electric field. There have been extensive studies on the couplings among electric signals, electric fields, homogeneous mechanical loads, temperature, and homogeneous shape deformations, and the basic science of how a homogeneous shape deformation affects the electric properties of ferroelectrics, characterized by the ""piezoelectric effect,"" is reasonably well understood. In this project, the PI will focus on understanding how an inhomogeneous stress or shape deformation affects the multifunctional properties of ferroelectrics, through the ""flexoelectric effect."" Effort will be devoted to developing efficient computational methods and employing them to model, predict, and understand internal, nanoscale inhomogeneous structures and properties of ferroelectric materials under the influence of the flexoelectric effect. The computational research will be carried out in close collaboration with numerous experimental groups, computational physicists, and applied mathematicians. The fundamental understanding achieved and the computational tools developed in this project should provide guidance to develop material systems that can exploit the flexoelectric effect that exists in all materials. The proposed research is expected to contribute to graduate education in materials as phase-field simulations of phase transformations and microstructure evolution are being incorporated into graduate courses at Penn State. In particular, user-friendly graphical interfaces for a number of applications of the phase-field models have been developed under prior NSF support. The software has been employed in two graduate courses and one undergraduate course. In addition, it has been used in summer short courses on computational thermodynamics and kinetics of phase transformations, which were offered to research scientists from national labs, engineers from industry, and professors and students from academia. This project will provide new computational tools to illustrate how materials properties may be modified through the flexoelectric effect. The PI will involve undergraduate students in the research by participating in a number of programs at Penn State including senior thesis projects and the Minority Undergraduate Research Experience program.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>Ferroelectrics are a class of materials in which a spontaneous electric polarization develops below their paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition temperatures. The spontaneous polarization direction can be reoriented among crystallographically defined orientations in a single crystal by an electric field. Very often a spontaneous strain arising from the crystal structure change at the ferroelectric transition accompanies the appearance of spontaneous polarization. So, the state of a ferroelectric crystal can generally be characterized macroscopically by two order parameters, polarization and strain. It is the coupling between the order parameters, polarization and strain, and the thermodynamic variables such as temperature, stress, and electric field that leads to the multifunctionality of a ferroelectric crystal ranging from dielectric, piezoelectric to pyroelectric properties, and thus to many applications in a wide variety of electronic devices, including capacitors, actuators, nonvolatile memories, and microelectromechanical systems. Although the thermodynamics of these couplings has been well established, the coupling among order parameters and their gradients is much less well understood. The main goal of this proposed program is to fundamentally understand the role of the flexoelectric effect, the coupling between polarization and the gradient of strain in the ferroelectricity of a crystal, in domain structures, polarization distributions across domain walls, and domain switching. There is sufficient evidence that the flexoelectric effect, which is small and generally ignored in macroscopic systems, may become significant or even dominant with decreasing size approaching nanostructures, particularly in ferroelectric materials which exhibit strong dielectric properties. The PI plans to employ a phase-field modeling approach integrated with mesoscale elasticity and electrostatic theory. The main objectives of this proposal are: (1) to develop a phase-field model of ferroelectric domain structures and switching incorporating flexoelectric contributions, (2) to study whether the flexoelectric contribution can significantly modify the properties of a ferroelectric domain wall and to discover potentially new domain wall features induced by the flexoelectric effect, (3) to investigate the role of the flexoelectric contribution to the polarization distribution and thus to domain structure in thin films, and (4) to investigate the flexoelectric response of ferroelectric thin films under a local mechanical force and explore the possibility of mechanical switching of ferroelectric polarization. The proposed research is expected to: (1) yield a phase-field formulation for modeling flexoelectric response of ferroelectrics, (2) significantly contribute to the fundamental understanding of the roles of flexoelectric effect in ferroelectric properties including domain wall structures, polarization distribution, and switching, and (3) produce advanced numerical algorithms based on the spectral method for solving phase-field equations involving domain wall anisotropy and flexoelectricity. The project will contribute to human resource development by training both graduate and undergraduate students through undergraduate thesis and summer research. The research findings will be disseminated to a wide audience through archival publications and conferences, review papers, and active participation and lectures at workshops and conferences. Finally, the PI will actively pursue collaborations with industry and national labs such as Los Alamos, Argonne, Oak Ridge, and the industrial members associated with the Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics (CDP) at North Carolina State University and Penn State to provide internship opportunities for students involved in the project.","goldenrod"

This project examines how religious minorities represent themselves in an effort to gain acceptance by the larger secular society of which they are a part. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how minority groups in democratic societies increasingly identify with, and invoke their religious identities toward their objectives for recognition and acceptance. Findings from this case study would be developed and shared with other researchers, building international scientific collaboration. Funding for this project will also broaden the participation of a historically underrepresented group in the sciences. <br/><br/>Randeep Hothi, under the supervision of Dr. Webb Keane of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will explore how religious minority groups strategically represent themselves for the purposes of recognition. The researcher examines minority-operated media networks in order to examine how deliberations that occur at the scale of face-to-face interaction produce publicly circulating religious discourse. This project builds on recent research in linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics that pay close attention to language-use as a resource for positioning and orienting subjects in social life. The researcher looks at Sikh cultural production, a context that proves to be important for analyzing language-use and stance in sociolinguistics because of the processes of self-presentation are driven by recognition-based cultural politics. By examining how minority cultural producers make complicated decisions about how Sikhism should be publicly presented, which representations of Sikhism should be disseminated, and how they will address their audiences, this research will also explain how multicultural societies produce religious discourse. The 12-month field research project employs a range of conventional linguistic and ethnographic methods of data collection and analyses, including participant observation, interviews, breaching experiments, life history interviews, media and archival analysis, and discourse analysis. This research provides an opportunity to examine the wider ramifications of minority cultural production in secular societies, and how minority identities are articulated and socially situated in public address.","maroon"

Given constrained budgets, the options for effectively and efficiently supporting sustainable software infrastructure are of growing importance. This project examines the transition of research infrastructure from grant-based funding to long term sustainable models, by examining scientific software projects as they transition to an open source peer production model. The project tracks software packages as they attempt to transition, and develops a theoretical framework for understanding this process and for explaining their success or failure. The outcome of this research will inform science policy by shaping how the community funds software infrastructure projects in their initial phases, and how to encourage the transition to long-term models thereafter.<br/><br/>Inspired by the success of open source software, funding agencies are encouraging transitions to forms of organization that organizational researchers call 'peer production.' Yet peer production research has shown that simply making code available under an open source license is insufficient to build a motivated and productive community. Successful transition includes changes in team structure (from local to distributed), collaboration technologies (from controlled to open), governance (from hierarchical to shared), and management of participants (from predictable to unpredictable commitment). This project examines successful and unsuccessful transitions from initial grant funding to peer production in scientific software development. Detailed case study histories are developed, by interviewing project participants, funders, and users of scientific software, and by analyzing project archives and software repositories. The research includes six transitioning projects: yt, Enzo, Eclipse PTP, IRODs, Apache OODT and Airavata. In addition, a panel of projects funded by the NSF Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation program (which requires plans for sustainability) will be tracked over time to study successful transitions, unsuccessful attempts, and cases where transition was judged inappropriate. The research is combined with an integrated education plan designed to build organizational skills in the scientific community to enable successful transitions to peer production.","mauve"

Yet, these events also revealed the role of mangroves and other vegetation as sustainable mitigation against tsunami hazard. The overarching goal of this research is to develop a quantitative understanding of tsunami inundation in regions with coastal forests. This project combines detailed fluid dynamics modeling with physical experiments to study tsunami inundation in the presence of discontinuous coastal forest. The transformative nature of this research lies in studying the effects of multi-scale processes on the large-scale tsunami inundation dynamics relevant for improving tsunami mitigation and preparedness. Laboratory experiments will be used to study inundation in discontinuous forest, represented by circular patches of cylinder arrays. Measurements will be used to quantify mean flow and turbulence statistics, the spatial flow field between two forest patches, runup speed, and large-scale flow structures during withdrawal. Numerical analysis will be integrated with the experimental campaign to expand the parameter set for analysis and to assess the impact of temporal changes in forest characteristics. The research team from Virginia Tech will use the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) tsunami laboratory facility at Oregon State University. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository (http://www.nees.org).<br/><br/>Research from this award will lead to better quantification of tsunami hazard reduction, or amplification, as a function of coastal forest density and layout, topographic slope, and tsunami wave form. Additionally, this research will lead to better quantification of the impact of coastal forests in regional-scale numerical models for tsunami inundation. Both of these outcomes will enable more accurate prediction of tsunami inundation and the resulting water force on homes, commercial buildings, and other infrastructure onshore. Ultimately, these advances will lead to more effective evacuation plans, more resilient building and infrastructure design, and more effective design of protective, sustainable forest features. These measures will help to reduce tsunami mortality, community displacement, and economic losses. The broader scientific impacts are in the applicability of the research outcomes to other coastal problems like tsunami wave propagation over coral reefs and storm surge propagation through wetlands, mangroves, and upland forests.

Quantifying the biogeochemical dynamics of the deep sea is necessary for understanding the oceanic cycling of carbon and other materials. Defining these dynamics requires knowledge of mixing and advective transport rates that can be applied to interpret concentration fields of biogeochemically important solutes. Despite having a half-life that is well suited for the study of both vertical and lateral transport in the deep ocean, few 227Ac measurements have been made in the deep sea. <br/><br/>In this project, a research team at the University of Southern California will make measurements of 227Ac water column profiles on the 2013 US GEOTRACES Pacific transect, a section from Peru to Tahiti, one of several American contributions to the International GEOTRACES effort. The team will also do analyses of archived sediments to constrain the regional benthic flux of this isotope and provide a boundary condition for interpreting its water column distribution. Recent advances in instrumentation facilitate this analysis, and the synergy provided by the GEOTRACES program will provide an ideal opportunity to obtain additional data that will serve two purposes. First, 227Ac will be of value in defining the spatial variability of mixing rates in the deep South Pacific, particularly when combined with estimates based on 228Ra (6 year half-life), a tracer field that a collaborating GEOTRACES proposal seeks to determine. Second, the mixing and transport rates defined by this tracer pair will be useful for deducing the transport and the dynamics of other solutes measured by GEOTRACES in deep waters. Solute transport is due to both mixing and advection. By using multiple tracers with different half-lives, the separate roles of these processes may be distinguished, allowing a more complete understanding of the dynamics of solute behaviors. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: As part of this effort, at least one undergraduate and one high school student will have the opportunity to participate in the research experience, gaining insight into the possibilities of careers in this area and learning the approaches taken in scientific research.","lavender"

Reproductive health, fertility and behavioral problems have been linked to abnormal development and function of the GnRH neuronal system. There is increasing evidence that endocrine disrupting chemicals, such as bisphenol A (BPA) - a synthetic estrogen in our environment - have deleterious effects on the reproductive systems and behaviors in many species. This study addresses how GnRH neuron development, physiology and reproductive behavior, are altered by chronic exposure to low levels of BPA. This project will use transgenic fish models, having GnRH neurons tagged with green fluorescent proteins, to address effects of chronic BPA exposure on: a) embryonic GnRH neuron development, b) physiology of adult GnRH neurons, and c) mating and social behavior. Experiments will use neural electrical recordings, confocal imaging, immunohistochemistry and behavioral observations. The project will result in understanding how endocrine disruptors modulate the GnRH system and suggest potential solutions for reproductive problems like ovarian dysfunction, miscarriages, pre-term births, precocious puberty and Kallman's syndrome. <br/><br/>This study will be the first to address the impact of BPA on GnRH neuron development, physiology, and function, in conjunction with whole animal behavior.

Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill. The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry. In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.<br/><br/>This research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting. This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene. This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill.","plum"

In particular, the Nordic Seas are a vital region for the circulation of the North Atlantic and for the moderation of our climate. Warm, surface sub-tropical waters flow northward in the Atlantic Ocean and pass into the Nordic Seas where their properties are modified by intense air-sea fluxes and they release heat to the atmosphere before returning south at depth as dense water that spills through the gaps in the ridge that runs between Greenland and Scotland. This process regulates our climate by providing a mechanism for the northward flow of heat in the Atlantic Ocean. The largest and densest of the outflows from the Nordic Seas occurs through the Denmark Strait, located between Iceland and Greenland. This Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) accounts for roughly half of the total dense water feeding the deep ocean current flowing southward along the east coast of the U.S. The source waters and dynamics upstream of the Denmark Strait affect the downstream fate of the overflow and the sensitivity of the deepest limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation to changes in climate forcing. This study will significantly improve our understanding of the circulation north of Denmark Strait by identifying and quantifying the different pathways, how they interact with each other, and their underlying dynamics. Furthermore, the project will shed light on the nature and causes of the pronounced variability of the DSOW at the sill. This has been observed in many previous studies but is yet to be fully explained using observational data. The international collaborators will contribute additional observations they collected in the Nordic Seas to the project. All of the mooring data used in the study (including those provided by the European collaborators) will be archived in a publicly accessible data portal. An outreach program will be carried out to share the results in the national media and to create science lesson content appropriate for public schools. The study will be led by a post-doctoral investigator.<br/><br/>The aim of the proposed project is to quantify the upstream sources of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (DSOW) and relate the variability in the different sources to that observed at the sill. To accomplish this, the investigators will use time series data provided by four different institutions who together deployed 12 moorings spanning the strait 200 kilometer north of the sill from August 2011 to August 2012, plus a mooring at the sill itself. While parts of the data have been analyzed previously by the individual investigators, never before have all of the data been considered in tandem. The first objective is to quantify a newly discovered pathway of dense water in the central portion of the strait, known as the Separated East Greenland Current. This pathway was recently revealed in a small number of shipboard crossings and is thought to be a free-jet located between the boundary current on the Greenland slope (the Shelfbreak East Greenland Current) and the Iceland slope (the North Icelandic Jet). The mooring data will be used to quantify the structure, transport, and dynamics of this newly recognized feature over a year-long period. Following this, the second objective is to produce the first strait-wide picture of the time-varying pathways carrying dense water into the Denmark Strait, and how the transport is partitioned between the three overflow pathways. Once this is established, the third objective is to elucidate the dynamics of the combined upstream circulation system and assess how this impacts the transport and hydrographic variability at the sill. The aim is to determine if the ubiquitous synoptic scale variability of the DSOW at the sill is driven by upstream fluctuations in any of the pathways, and/or if hydraulic processes at the sill influence the upstream circulation. The final objective of the study is to devise a sparse mooring array that could be implemented in the future to optimally monitor the upstream sources of DSOW over interannual to decadal time scales.","lavender"

Tracing the driving forces behind these tectonic activities is vital to understand how the ancient continental roots, continental and oceanic plates at the plate margins, and mantle flows underlying lithosphere interact amongst each other in a dynamic earth framework. It?s essential to obtain high-definition multi-parameter seismic images of the earth?s interior to test different hypotheses of the tectonic driving forces, such as crustal shortening or/and Indian plate underthrusting causing the uplift of ?the world?s roof?, the Tibetan Plateau, lower-mantle plume or/and dehydration from the stagnant slab in the mantle transition zone (410 ? 650 km depths) inducing hot mantle upwelling contributing to the intraplate volcano Changbaishan along the border of China and North Korea, and the Pacific slab subduction and rollback producing extension, transtension, and thinning of the lithosphere beneath the East China and opening of the marginal seas of Japan and South China. Seismic imaging in this study will map full waveforms of seismic records to render more realistic models representing the earth?s interior properties. The outcome will not only provide the independent and robust seismological constrains to test the end members of tectonic formation mechanism, but also shed new light on the composition, thermal state, flow and fabric structure of the lithosphere and upper mantle, which are complementary to geological, geochemical, petrological, and geodetic observations of East Asia.<br/><br/>An unprecedented seismic waveform dataset recorded by very dense array stations in China and its surrounding regions will be used to image the crust and upper-mantle structure beneath the East Asia. This dataset is comprised of seismic records from the CEArray, the NECESSArray, the INDEPTH-IV Array, F-net and other global and regional seismic networks. Contrary to traditional ray-theory based seismic imaging, adjoint tomography of this study takes into account full 3D wave propagation effects and off-ray-path sensitivity. In this implementation, it utilizes a spectral-element method for precise wave propagation simulations. The tomographic method starts with a 3D initial model that combines the smooth radially anisotropic mantle model S362ANI with 3D crustal model Crust2.0 (potentially recently released Crust1.0 can be used for more accurate and higher resolution model refinement). Traveltime and amplitude misfits are minimized iteratively based on a conjugate gradient method, harnessing 3D finite-frequency kernels computed for each updated 3D model. The massively parallel simulations are carried out on XSEDE supercomputers available to the team via an existing XSEDE research allocation. The final models will allow close examination of seismic structures beneath different tectonic units of East Asia, and better understanding of how sub-surface processes shaping surface geology and tectonic features. The preliminary results already show strong correlations between heterogeneities in the crust and upper mantle with surface tectonic units, such as the Himalaya Block, the Tibetan Plateau, the Tarim Basin, the Ordos Block, and the Sichuan Basin. Narrow slab features emerge from the smooth initial model above the transition zone. 3D wavespeed variations in the preliminary model are either comparable to or sharper than high-frequency P- and S-wave tomographic images from previous studies. Additional iterations will be carried out to refine the 3D radially anisotropic models, and to resolve 3D azimuthal anisotropy and attenuation, which are closely related to mantle rheology and crustal and lithospheric strain rates and flow. This proposal will support one graduate student and one research scientist. The outcome of this research will also have a broader impact on understanding the linkage between 3D wavespeed heterogeneities and seismogenic processes. The more realistic high-definition models will help assess seismic hazard by providing more accurate ground motion maps, more robust slip predictions and rupture estimations on finite fault surfaces for future catastrophic earthquakes. The final models will be archived and distributed for quantitative studies in other fields of geoscience, such as geology, geochemistry, petrology, geodynamics and volcanology. With the existing 3D visualization lab facility at Rice, the earth models can be readily displayed to the public to promote earth science. Finally the results will enhance scientific communication between US and China and broaden future potential collaborations.","hot_pink"

In previous surveys of undergraduate faculty who might use OOI data in their classrooms, the majority of professors surveyed (73%) indicated that they have used data in their teaching within the last year. They also reported that they found it useful to integrate data in their teaching to help students draw conclusions from evidence and that they are using online archived data, journal publications, and data that the professors had collected themselves. A small subset of professors indicated that they use online real-time data. When asked where they could use the most help in improving their practice with teaching with data, responses varied by career stage.

In a world where over half of the world's population now lives in cities, finding this balance is crucial because poor urban planning and management may have costly consequences in economic growth, public health, general well-being, and environmental quality. In recent years, a number of American cities have exhibited the effects of infrastructural failures: flagging economic investment, social unrest, and disease outbreaks. But while the effects are clear, the solutions are not. In the research supported by this award, anthropologists Dr. Joshua B. Fisher (High Point University) and Dr. Alex Nading (University of Edinburgh) will address the problem through innovative research in an urban context whose history of experimentation with policy alternatives and relatively small size, will be particularly revealing of what works, what does not, for whom, and why. <br/><br/>The researchers will travel to Ciudad Sandino, a section of peri-urban Managua, Nicaragua. Recently, in response to increased income inequality, urban environmental degradation, and declining revenues from tourism and foreign investment, the city has undertaken a new, cross-sector, integrated urban development campaign, ""Live Clean, Live Healthy, Live Beautiful, Live Well."" The researchers will examine the complex impacts of this program upon matters of waste management, environmental education, food safety, and public health. They will collect data with a suite of ethnographic research methods including ethnographic interviews, participant observation, photo documentation, and archival analysis. In addition to these more traditional research methods, the researchers will also collect data interactively and dynamically by creating and following a longitudinal ethnographic cohort. Through a series of workshops over three years, a diverse array of citizens including policy-makers, teachers, and informal economy food producers and garbage pickers will be asked to provide feedback to each other and to the researchers on how the programs are affecting them and their worlds. Findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that shape the development of effective urban social policy and successful cities, given their many entangled social, economic, and environmental dimensions.","maroon"

For example, biomechanics researchers examine volumes derived from insect scans to understand how form relates to function, particularly in regard to how insects create internal fluid flows. For effective analysis of a 3D volume, scientists and other users need to integrate various views, peer inside the volume, and separate various structures in the data. However, despite many advances in volume rendering algorithms, neither traditional displays nor traditional interaction techniques are sufficient for efficient and accurate analysis of complex volume datasets. This project develops an approach for interactively exploring and segmenting volume datasets by combining and extending: (1) utilization of advanced, high-fidelity displays based on virtual reality (VR) technologies for improving the visual analysis of volume data, and (2) the use of natural, gesture-based 3D techniques. Using controlled, empirical studies with real-world volume datasets from biomechanics and other biological sciences, the investigators are determining what characteristics of advanced displays can lead to faster, more accurate visual analysis. Iterative design and evaluation methods are being used to develop usable and natural 3D interaction techniques with which users can explore the interior of volume datasets. Beyond the empirical findings of these studies, an important outcome of the project is the design of a next-generation volume data analysis system that can be used by scientists and researchers to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their work.<br/><br/>The expected results will provide a deep understanding of visualization principles fostering further advancements in the realm of volume data analysis. Easier, more accurate, and faster analysis can lead to improvements in healthcare, breakthroughs in science, and advances in education. For example, this work may lead to insights into fundamental physiological mechanisms of feeding, breathing, and circulation in insects - one of the most important animal groups on earth. There are millions of insect species living in almost every habitat, and their lifestyles have profound impacts on human societies. Their effects in areas such as agriculture and health can be both positive (e.g., pollination) and negative (e.g., crop damage, disease), and understanding their fundamental physiologies is critical to controlling their impact. The project provides opportunities for interdisciplinary educational and research activities for graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach activities to underrepresented students. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly via publication in archival journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and online forums. The project website (https://research.cs.vt.edu/3di/node/188) will provide access to research results, including data sets and software.","indigo"

This project is an attempt to understand how interstellar gas and energetic particles are ejected from galaxy disks, where most of the gas and stars are found, and interact with the galaxy halo. This cyclical process is important for understanding how star formation proceeds in galaxies, and the rate at which galaxies grew when they were forming. The study makes use of radio images from the NSF-funded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), optical data from the Apache Point 3.5-meter telescope, as well as archival infrared data. The project will provide opportunities for two PhD student theses at Hispanic Serving Institutions, and the PIs will also contribute to a training program run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory for faculty at small colleges.<br/><br/>Galaxy growth and evolution depend on both the acquisition of gas from the galaxy environment and energetic outflows from disks. The detailed physics of these processes needs to be understood, and nearby edge-on galaxies are the best objects where it is possible to cleanly separate disk and halo components. The project leverages a major new survey of radio continuum emission from edge-on galaxies called CHANG-ES (Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies: an EVLA Survey). The first goal is to further our understanding of the dynamics of disk-halo flows by assessing the role of non-thermal gas pressure gradients in galaxy halos, using radio maps made from the VLA and GBT. The second goal focuses on identifying sites of cosmic ray (CR) injection and propagation into galaxy halos. For this, the spatial variation of the non-thermal spectral index will be mapped, after robustly separating thermal and non-thermal radio emission using CHANG-ES maps in conjunction with infrared data and H-alpha images. The third science goal is to examine the connection between CR outflows and disk-halo cycling of thermal gas, and whether this relation depends on factors such as star formation rate.","lime"

Yet it is often difficult to determine the effects of this fiscal uncertainty on the technologies, communities, and scientific findings that such funding is meant to support. This project uses the case study of NASA spacecraft mission teams to examine how scientists secure, maintain, and compete for funding during moments of financial crisis, with an eye to how these activities affect scientific and technical results. The research offers policy implications for public funding. During times of greater fiscal scrutiny and austerity, federal agencies and policy-makers require data-driven understanding of the consequences for long-term scientific and technical innovation that are associated with trade-offs in funding levels and priority-setting. <br/><br/>This project accumulates archival, interview, and budgetary data across three periods of fiscal uncertainty endured by six spacecraft missions: the late 1960s and early 70s (Mariner 10 and Viking), the ""lost"" 1980s (Galileo and Mars Observer), and the ""faster, better, cheaper"" era of the 1990s (Cassini and Pathfinder). The research assembles as comprehensive a dataset as possible on the specific technical and scientific changes on the ground due to budgetary crises, combining oral history interviews with project managers and cost estimators with hard numbers accumulated in reports. Planetary science is accustomed to budgetary upheavals and has developed many strategies to mitigate the impact of fiscal uncertainty. The fiscal backdrop for each of these missions illuminates the social and interactional mechanisms for securing funding as well as the ultimate effects of financial decision-making upon scientific work. Thus unlike studies of technology or science that frame funding as an external affair, or that examine science and politics as separate fields, this case demonstrates how science funding is a continual process woven through scientific work, requiring many layered relationships between individuals and institutions. The project therefore unites many social science fields including history and sociology of science, economic sociology, historical sociology and the science of team science, to investigate the impact of fiscal challenges on scientific collaboration, integration and dissemination.","aquamarine"

The explosion of the global service sector, in tandem with women's increasing labor force participation, has resulted in a global ""care deficit."" This has resulted in the reorganization of households and the creation of new labor markets. This research examines why and how migrant family child care workers in global cities provide subcontracted care to young children of working parents. Family child care (FCC) has been selected as a point of inquiry as it has become one of the fastest growing occupations in the U.S., with an estimated 2.3 million workers and many more working informally. The researcher focuses on childcare providers who service women and families in low-wage service work, an important sample population as previous scientific studies have tended to focus on upper middle class and affluent families. The researcher will conduct 12 months of ethnographic research, using participant observation, interviews, life histories, material and discourse analyses, and archival and statistical data collection. <br/><br/>Ethnographic inquiry into family child care is critical to the ways in which everyday household practices are entwined with social and political economic hierarchies, practices of affective care and labor and constructions of family. At the same time, the experiences of these providers offer insight into change in the face of rapid economic dislocations. This project will bring new light and dialogue around continued local and global socioeconomic inequalities, shifting social and cultural concepts, and transformations in the role of the state, and reveal how low-wage workers engage these realities through their labor, household, and socioeconomic practices. <br/><br/>The U.S. is behind many countries in providing child care support for families with children. While other countries recognize the economic burden of child care, particularly for low-wage families, the U.S. does not been able to adequately address this child care deficit. The research will help policymakers understand the dynamics that can contribute to the maximization of labor productivity, thereby improving the economic competitiveness of the U.S. The project will also support the training of a graduate student.","maroon"

While we know that individual differences in behaviors such as cooperation or aggression influence the role that individuals play within their social network, we know little about the physiological mechanisms underlying those differences. Wire-tailed manakins provide a model system to study the links between hormones, behavior and social networking because males form cooperative partnerships that are the foundation of complex social networks. Using this model system this research will integrate evolutionary, behavioral, endocrine and neurogenetic approaches to understand the physiological and evolutionary basis of individual variation in cooperation and how those individual-level processes scale up to influence an individual's role and position within their social network in a dynamic fashion. Because endocrine function is similar across a wide variety of animals, the outcomes of this work will be broadly applicable. The project will train at least 16 undergraduate students and 1 graduate student in integrative research in the US and at the field site in Ecuador. This research will also be featured in a planned exhibit which will describe the hormonal basis of social behavior and highlight the similarities between human and animal social networks at the National Zoological Park's Amazonia Science Gallery. Research products will be integrated in to tropical ecology courses at the Tipunti Biodiversity Station which hosts the work in Ecuador. This project is jointly supported by the Animal Behavior Program and International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/><br/>This project will link hormone-regulatory networks and social networks to transform our understanding of how the endocrine system regulates behavior and influences social dynamics at the individual and population levels. The project will test two alternative hypotheses for how selection has shaped the evolution of hormone-mediated social behaviors involving testosterone: the phenotypic integration hypothesis and the phenotypic independence hypothesis in wire-tailed manakins where males cooperate to perform mating displays on a lek. This highly integrative project will quantify male behaviors in nature (dominance, cooperation, display rate), use nanotags and proximity data loggers to capture all the social interactions and map the social network, measure circulating hormone levels across the year, describe the maximum capacity for testosterone production in males of different status using GnRH challenges, measure the effect of social intrusion on hormone titers, block or increase hormone titers to manipulate phenotype, and measure expression levels of candidate genes for steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors and steroid influenced peptide signaling systems in the brains of these males using RT-qPCR. These data from individual birds will then be combined to examine network structures using binary and weighted models and to examine the influence of hormones on network structure and dynamics. All data from the study will be archived at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center web site (http://www.si.edu/smbc). The brain transcriptome assembly for the wire-tailed manakin will be posted on NCBI GenBank.","teal"

For example, biomechanics researchers examine volumes derived from insect scans to understand how form relates to function, particularly in regard to how insects create internal fluid flows. For effective analysis of a 3D volume, scientists and other users need to integrate various views, peer inside the volume, and separate various structures in the data. However, despite many advances in volume rendering algorithms, neither traditional displays nor traditional interaction techniques are sufficient for efficient and accurate analysis of complex volume datasets. This project develops an approach for interactively exploring and segmenting volume datasets by combining and extending: (1) utilization of advanced, high-fidelity displays based on virtual reality (VR) technologies for improving the visual analysis of volume data, and (2) the use of natural, gesture-based 3D techniques. Using controlled, empirical studies with real-world volume datasets from biomechanics and other biological sciences, the investigators are determining what characteristics of advanced displays can lead to faster, more accurate visual analysis. Iterative design and evaluation methods are being used to develop usable and natural 3D interaction techniques with which users can explore the interior of volume datasets. Beyond the empirical findings of these studies, an important outcome of the project is the design of a next-generation volume data analysis system that can be used by scientists and researchers to improve the efficiency and accuracy of their work.<br/><br/>The expected results will provide a deep understanding of visualization principles fostering further advancements in the realm of volume data analysis. Easier, more accurate, and faster analysis can lead to improvements in healthcare, breakthroughs in science, and advances in education. For example, this work may lead to insights into fundamental physiological mechanisms of feeding, breathing, and circulation in insects - one of the most important animal groups on earth. There are millions of insect species living in almost every habitat, and their lifestyles have profound impacts on human societies. Their effects in areas such as agriculture and health can be both positive (e.g., pollination) and negative (e.g., crop damage, disease), and understanding their fundamental physiologies is critical to controlling their impact. The project provides opportunities for interdisciplinary educational and research activities for graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach activities to underrepresented students. The results of this work will be disseminated broadly via publication in archival journals, peer-reviewed conferences, and online forums. The project website (https://research.cs.vt.edu/3di/node/188) will provide access to research results, including data sets and software.","indigo"

These issues include (1) three-dimensional bridge geometries such as deck shape, skew and embankments, whose hydraulic characteristics can lead to channelization, bore entrapment, and shielding; (2) debris impact and debris damming that can greatly increase the forces on a bridge, both during the initial impact of the tsunami waves and during the outflows; and (3) fluid-structure interaction effects that can be significant for particular types of bridges and retrofit strategies, such as the deployment of fenders or in cases with flexible structures. Bridge-specific retrofit strategies will also be explored. Recent advances in the development of parallel processing software and the availability of powerful computational platforms make it possible to simulate these complex effects. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling will address the effects of three-dimensional hydraulic geometries. The Material Point Method (MPM) will address the effects of debris impact fields and damming by modeling debris explicitly. The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), as implemented in OpenSees, will allow researchers to consider the fluid-structure interaction, the effects of the preceding earthquake shaking and the effect of uncertainties. As part of this planning grant, the simulation strategies will be developed sufficiently to guide the detailed design of critical experiments in a NEES2 facility early in FY2015. <br/><br/>Over the past decade, tsunamis have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage. The loss of critical lifeline structures has exacerbated these catastrophes by delaying emergency response efforts and post-event economic recovery. Large tsunamis also threaten at least five U.S. states and numerous U.S. territories. Nearly all past tsunami research has focused on run-up modeling, the development of evacuation strategies, and more recently, on the design of buildings to resist tsunamis. In comparison, little research has addressed the tsunami performance of bridges, and no guidelines are available to design safe and economical tsunami-resistant bridges or to develop retrofit strategies. To these ends, the proposed research will transform the design of tsunami-resistant bridges, and consequently, greatly improve post-event response and recovery efforts.

Microbial synthesis of fatty-acid-derived hydrocarbon molecules (alkanes and alkenes) has garnered intense interest in recent years as potential sources of renewable fuels and chemicals. Realization of this potential necessitates a molecular-level understanding of the genes and gene functions involved in microbial hydrocarbon biosynthesis and their relationship with the fatty acid biosynthetic processes that provide the chemical backbone for these hydrocarbon products. The current project focuses on several newly discovered microbial biosynthetic pathways catalyzing the formation of secondary lipids, accessory lipid molecules that are chemically distinct from core (primary) fatty acid products and synthesized via a novel biosynthetic mechanism in diverse microbial lineages. Our current knowledge of chemical products associated with secondary lipid biosynthetic pathways is severely limited. Likewise, the biological function(s) of these lipid classes is unknown. The goal of this CAREER project is to characterize the genetic and physiological basis of unique microbial fatty acid and fatty acid-derived hydrocarbon biosynthesis. A key deliverable of this research will be a translational framework uniting functionally diverse microbial processes involved in lipid and hydrocarbon synthesis with the physiological, ecological and evolutionary underpinnings of lipid diversification. To confront these outstanding scientific questions and advance the scientific foundation for the production of renewable commodity hydrocarbons, the research strategy involves three synergistic specific aims: Pathway Discovery, Product Discovery, and Physiological Significance. By integrating comprehensive data-mining strategies that leverage all available genomic and metagenomic sequence archives and the direct interrogation of environmental samples for lipid and hydrocarbon biosynthetic activities, the proposed research will deliver important new insight into microbial lipid metabolism as it relates to bioenergy applications.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. In addition to its scientific and societal impacts relevant to bioenergy, this project will directly contribute to the teaching and training of students in diverse scientific disciplines including bioinformatics, genetics, analytical chemistry, and biotechnology. To enhance the infrastructure for research and education, one key deliverable of this research will be a comprehensive database devoted to microbial lipid and hydrocarbon biosynthesis. This research component will provide actionable data for potential biotechnological application and exploitation. Furthermore, to extend the impact of this research and engage a broader student audience, a globally accessible educational resource will be developed highlighting the exciting concept of biological discovery to biotechnological application.

It is non-invasive and free of fluid heating issues that accompany nearly all other techniques, and is therefore well suited to handling bioparticles. However, traditional magnetic control requires the particles to be manipulated being magnetizable, which renders it necessary to magnetically label bioparticles. Ferrofluids have been recently demonstrated to implement nonmagnetic particle and cell manipulations in microfluidic devices with no magnetic tagging. The success of these devices relies on a comprehensive understanding of particle magnetophoresis in ferrofluid flows. Moreover, the potential of such ferrofluid-based magnetic techniques is far from being fully explored. The research objectives of this CAREER proposal are to develop a fundamental knowledge of particle magnetophoresis in ferrofluid microflows, and to explore the diverse manipulations of nonmagnetic particles in ferromicrofluidics, with the goals of establishing a new research direction in particulate and multiphase processes and developing a new technology for label-free cell handling in lab-on-a-chip applications. A comprehensive education plan will be integrated with the research goals of this CAREER proposal toward ultimately establishing a Clemson research and education program on microfluidics fundamentals and lab-on-a-chip applications. The proposed education and outreach activities include the development of a self-learner style web-based minicourses series, the development of a K-12 outreach program with an emphasis on minority students and students from families living in poverty, and the training and mentoring of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students with an active involvement of women and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>The proposed research represents the first comprehensive study of magnetophoretic transport and manipulation of nonmagnetic particles in ferrofluid microflows. It will complement the current knowledge of particle magnetophoresis in microchannels, and advance the design and control of magnetic microfluidic devices. The demonstrated label-free manipulations of nonmagnetic particles in ferrofluid microflows will find direct near-term applications in a wide range of technological solutions such as flow cytometry (via three-dimensional focusing), filtration (via trapping), biosensing (via concentration), and continuous-flow sorting (via separation). The proposed research will essentially benefit every engineering application of particle magnetophoresis in many areas such as biomedicine and environmental monitoring. It will also impact several scientific and technological communities including microfluidics, transport phenomena, polymer sciences, and bioengineering. The proposed integration of research into education will advance discovery while promoting learning through the development of research-based education materials and the training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in research. Practical skills gained in the laboratory and in presentations will prepare students for future careers. The dissemination of research results into the community through both archival publications and the proposed open minicourses and outreach to local high schools, especially underrepresented groups, will enhance scientific and technological understanding and benefit society.","coral"

Community-level theories predict that conflict increases when one group threatens the status, authority, or material resources of the other group. That might suggest that the individuals selected as victims would be those whose characteristics pose the greatest threat to prevailing social arrangements -- those who are the most successful. Research on both historical lynching and contemporary bias crimes, however, tells us that it is people who have lower socioeconomic status, fewer apparent social ties, who are chosen as victims, but also tells us that people victimized by more and less severe attacks often differ from each other. This study will help to resolve this tension between theories that explain the emergence of conflict and those that explain both the selection of victims and the severity of their victimization. It will incorporate the social, policy, and economic context of intergroup conflict; the severity of victimization; and the relative and absolute characteristics of victims themselves. It will expand understanding of the role of victim characteristics by allowing the researcher to identify how individual traits are related to victimization itself as well as the severity of attack, once a person has been selected as a potential target of intergroup violence. While lynching is largely an historic practice, victimization based on gender, perceived sexual identity, race/ethnicity, religious adherence, and economic status continues to plague societies around the globe. This project will help reframe our understanding of the dynamics of victimization in multiple ways. The researcher will use historical census records to locate individuals who were threatened with lynching, but not killed, in ten Southern states across a span of 50 years (1882 - 1930). Records for these intended victims, and all other people in their households, will be merged with existing data on people who were lynched, as well as on nonvictim members of their communities. Comparing these groups will allow the researcher to identify the characteristics that put individuals at risk of various levels of victimization. The investigator will also incorporate county-level social, demographic, economic, and political data to determine which community factors placed high and low status people at elevated risk of victimization. Data, including a database and ""case files"" with research notes and historical documents for each case, will be distributed via a public web site.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/><br/>This project will promote training and learning by incorporating graduate and undergraduate students at an urban, public university in the conduct, presentation, and publication of research. The quantitative analyses, identifying the characteristics that predicted victimization and its severity, as well as the contextual factors that put individuals with particular characteristics at risk, will help us better understand contemporary bias crime and ethnic conflict. Finally, the interactive elements of the website develops and implements a new model of incorporating broader public participation in the collection of social scientific data, allowing members of the public to conduct their own archival research and contribute to the development of our data. The publicly-available website will allow academics, amateur researchers, and genealogists to access information on lynched and intended victims, and help improve the quality of the data.","crimson"

The approach is based on the use of computational thinking for historical reconstructions of seventeenth-century geometrical and instrument construction techniques. The intellectual merits of the proposal are the rigorous design of the domain specific language, descriptive insight and abstraction of the above techniques, an archival representation for describing basic data structures tailored to string instruments, and language constructs for generating drawings. Because instrument making, from conception to construction, is so founded on algorithmic method, computational thinking is a natural rubric for organizing design, and creating a hierarchy of techniques that give order to the decomposition of the plane into an instrument form, and to the ancillary geometric problems that are solved with ruler-and-compass constructions. This work is integrated with building violoncellos, connecting the historical and conceptual with the practical. The underlying domain-specific language, as an added and beneficial impact, may also be useful for teaching principles of geometry at a middle- or high-school level. The project's broader significance and importance are in providing a foundation for a descriptive tool for analyzing the evolution of instrument designs over time.<br/><br/>The domain-specific language is, at its core, a ruler-and-compass programming language for doing geometric constructions. Higher-order procedures in the language, can be used to abstract over canonical geometric constructions at the ""assembly language"" level of ruler-and-compass steps, providing an abstract, yet fully functional description of how these outlines were historically conceived.

Most programmers work on projects they did not start. Most companies spend more on maintaining old systems than on building new ones. This is good, because it shows that companies build software that is worth keeping and maintaining, but it also means that change is the heart of software development. Most programming tools treat change at a very low level: programmers make most changes with text editors, and tools tend to focus on changes to lines of text, and although programming is predominantly about change, contemporary tools do not provide direct support for understanding or facilitating change. This makes programming more expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone than it should be. This research project will develop a change-oriented programming environment (COPE) that supports change by putting transformations at the center of software development. COPE will enable both average and expert programmers to write, script, modify, and replay their own transformations. COPE will enable programmers to think about programs as compositions of transformations, and to automate as many of these transformations as possible. Characterizing software development in terms of transformations is an essential step to take software engineering from manual development to automated (or semi-automated) development of software.<br/><br/>By enabling programmers to express their programming tasks as program transformations, COPE will alter the way programmers think about, teach, create, reuse, and understand programs. Specifically, COPE considers five activities: (1) analyze what changes programmers typically make and how they perceive, recall, and communicate changes, (2) automate transformations to make it easier to apply and script changes, (3) develop tools that compose and manipulate transformations to make it easier to reuse them, (4) integrate transformations with version control to provide better ways for archiving and understanding changes, and (5) develop tools that infer higher-level transformations from lower-level changes. COPE will deliver a rich transformation-aware toolset that synergistically integrates all these activities. COPE aims to (a) change the way people program, (b) create a platform for research for future research, and (c) produce results that ultimately will become standard software development practice. The PIs will disseminate the results through presentations, books, publications, open-source code, industrial collaborations, and educational activities. A version of COPE will be used to revamp the software engineering curriculum at the University of Illinois and the University of Texas to emphasize the science of change in large code bases.","ivory"

Slip varies in time and space along the fault and understanding the slip patterns can lead to new insights about which fault sections are most likely to produce damaging 'megathrust' events (greater than magnitude 8). By studying smaller events that occur throughout a seismic cycle (loading, rupture, post seismic, reloading etc) this study can provide context for updated regional hazard assessment. An undergraduate intern and a PhD student will receive seismology training using both onshore and offshore data. <br/><br/>A portion of the spectrum of slip behaviors along the Cascadia megathrust fault will be studied using seismic data from the Amphibious Array- reoccupied EarthScope Transportable Array sites and OBSIP ocean bottom seismometers. Small repeating earthquakes will be documented for the 4-yr duration of Cascadia Initiative (CI) and their distribution will be interpreted in terms of fault character and possible along-strike variation in structure within the subducting plate. The offshore coverage is expected to eliminate a current bias in observations where onshore-only results suggest that low frequency events (LFE) only occur in the down-dip part of the seismogenic zone. A pilot study confirms that the planned automated spectral detection method can succeed on CI ocean bottom seismometer data. There is potential for shallow repeating events to occur in the up-dip portion of the megathrust zone and there may be variations in level and type of source signature, including possibly new LFE, along the Cascadia subduction zone. A lesson designed for an undergraduate course will be developed and archived on the IRIS InClass and SERC servers. The event catalog and source parameter results will be made available via publication supplements and at least one NSF-supported open database (IEDA).","lavender"

While we know that individual differences in behaviors such as cooperation or aggression influence the role that individuals play within their social network, we know little about the physiological mechanisms underlying those differences. Wire-tailed manakins provide a model system to study the links between hormones, behavior and social networking because males form cooperative partnerships that are the foundation of complex social networks. Using this model system this research will integrate evolutionary, behavioral, endocrine and neurogenetic approaches to understand the physiological and evolutionary basis of individual variation in cooperation and how those individual-level processes scale up to influence an individual's role and position within their social network in a dynamic fashion. Because endocrine function is similar across a wide variety of animals, the outcomes of this work will be broadly applicable. The project will train at least 16 undergraduate students and 1 graduate student in integrative research in the US and at the field site in Ecuador. This research will also be featured in a planned exhibit which will describe the hormonal basis of social behavior and highlight the similarities between human and animal social networks at the National Zoological Park's Amazonia Science Gallery. Research products will be integrated in to tropical ecology courses at the Tipunti Biodiversity Station which hosts the work in Ecuador. This project is jointly supported by the Animal Behavior Program and International Science and Engineering.<br/><br/><br/>This project will link hormone-regulatory networks and social networks to transform our understanding of how the endocrine system regulates behavior and influences social dynamics at the individual and population levels. The project will test two alternative hypotheses for how selection has shaped the evolution of hormone-mediated social behaviors involving testosterone: the phenotypic integration hypothesis and the phenotypic independence hypothesis in wire-tailed manakins where males cooperate to perform mating displays on a lek. This highly integrative project will quantify male behaviors in nature (dominance, cooperation, display rate), use nanotags and proximity data loggers to capture all the social interactions and map the social network, measure circulating hormone levels across the year, describe the maximum capacity for testosterone production in males of different status using GnRH challenges, measure the effect of social intrusion on hormone titers, block or increase hormone titers to manipulate phenotype, and measure expression levels of candidate genes for steroidogenic enzymes, steroid receptors and steroid influenced peptide signaling systems in the brains of these males using RT-qPCR. These data from individual birds will then be combined to examine network structures using binary and weighted models and to examine the influence of hormones on network structure and dynamics. All data from the study will be archived at the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center web site (http://www.si.edu/smbc).

This project seeks to cast a new perspective on single-party government resilience by probing the informal dimension of the system. More specifically, it focuses on how networks of patron-client relations structure political interactions among party elites and shape the broader patterns of political and economic development at both the national and subnational levels. Contrary to the conventional wisdom that views informal, clientelistic relations as primarily a cause for corruption, political instability and economic decay, this project argues that they actually contribute to the single-party government's resilience by serving as a key organizational mechanism that mobilizes, incentivizes, and coordinates actors in a system where the formal institutions are poorly equipped to perform such functions. Using China as the case of interest, this project contributes to a growing body of research on the role of informal institutions in political and economic governance. The project also offers new data and methods for reconstructing the social world of Chinese political elites since the 1990s. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project seeks to cast a new perspective on single-party government resilience by probing the informal dimension of the system. The research project seeks to systematically measure the presence of informal networks among Chinese elites and evaluate their impacts on the following four dimensions: (1) political institutionalization, (2) economic development, (3) policy implementation, and (4) anticorruption enforcement. The main quantitative evidence is drawn from an original biographical database of over 4,000 politicians at city, provincial, and national levels since early 1990s. The project develops new automated algorithms for identifying patron-client ties by linking lower-level officials with political superiors who oversaw their major promotions in the past, and leverages carefully chosen natural experiments to estimate the causal effects of informal networks. To supplement the quantitative analyses, the PI will also conduct in-depth interviews with serving and retired officials in both central and local governments, and collects additional historical and archival materials during his fieldwork in China.","crimson"

A major concern is the response of Earth's remaining ice sheets to present-day (and future) CO2 levels, and their attendant contribution to sea-level rise. In the case of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS), models suggest a threshold behavior where the GIS will completely melt once a certain temperature is exceeded. However, different models suggest different thresholds, so it is unclear whether the Earth has already crossed an ice-free Greenland tipping point. The last period when atmospheric CO2 reached ~400 ppm was during the mid-Pliocene climate optimum 3.3-3.0 million years ago, providing a past analogue to Earth's present climate. Climate and ice-sheet models simulate a warmer Earth with a smaller GIS, but show a range of responses. Pliocene sea-level records are significantly complicated by movement of the crust from advance and retreat of later ice sheets, preventing clear documentation of global ice volume. This project will investigate the response of the south GIS and adjacent Labrador Sea to elevated CO2 in the mid Pliocene using marine sediment archives preserved in the Eirik Drift off of south Greenland. Specific questions to be addressed are: 1) How warm was the Labrador Sea during the mid-Pliocene optimum?, and 2) Did south Greenland completely deglaciate in response to this warmth? Results of this study will help establish whether the Earth has already crossed a tipping point that will lead to an ice-free Greenland.<br/><br/>The research team will answer these research questions using methods developed for tracking GIS behavior during Quaternary interglacials. Question 1 will be addressed through foraminifer census data and measurement of d18O and Mg/Ca on planktonic foraminifera in the Eirik Drift across the mid-Pliocene optimum sequence recorded in International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Site U1307. Question 2 will be answered through the tracing of the sources of mid-Pliocene detrital sediment in the Eirik Drift using silt-size Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic signatures and silt- and clay-size magnetic properties. The team's extensive provenance work has shown that silt-size particles with Precambrian isotopic signatures, high magnetic concentrations, and coarse magnetic grain-sizes are only produced on Greenland through GIS erosion of the bedrock; Iceland has distinctively different magnetic and isotopic signatures. GIS melting provides the mechanism to deliver these silt particles to the Eirik Drift. If a south Greenland terrane deglaciates removing the erosive agent and transport mechanism, the terrane's isotopic and magnetic signatures are largely absent in Eirik Drift sediment. These records will determine the Labrador Sea and south GIS response to present-day CO2 levels including the impact of long-term feedbacks necessary for assessing Earth-system sensitivity. The combination of ocean climate and south GIS records will test if the climate threshold necessary to deglaciate Greenland lies at ~400 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration. This project will support a postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students in multi-proxy approaches in the fields of paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, geochemistry, environmental magnetism, and glacial geology to address societally relevant climate/sea-level questions. Under-represented groups in the geosciences will take precedent in recruitment of the postdoctoral researcher and undergraduate students.","lavender"

Their shells are composed of calcium carbonate and the oxygen isotopic composition of their shells record climatic conditions during growth. Therefore, the oxygen isotopic composition of land snails has the potential to reconstruct past climates on broad spatial and temporal scales. To date, however, there is a little understanding on the kinds of climatic information that can be inferred from the snails, and therefore, their current use as paleoclimatic archives is limited. This proposal will develop, test, and calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of small land snails for use as a paleoclimatic proxy in terrestrial settings across North America. The modern calibration of this proxy will benefit society through the development of a terrestrial paleoclimatic proxy that is capable of reconstructing past climate over broad spatial and temporal scales and also will improve our understanding of the taxonomic diversity and spatial distribution of land snails, a fauna that is decreasing at an alarming rate globally. This project will teach and train future scientists, from high school to PhD candidates, integrate scientists from multiple fields (paleontology, biology, Quaternary geology), and broaden the participation of diverse and underrepresented groups. Dissemination of results will include a diverse audience (specialists and general public), in English and Spanish to reach the Hispanic community in USA and elsewhere. This project will establish linkages between underrepresented groups and STEM disciplines at research-intensive universities. <br/><br/>To calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of modern land snails in North America, investigators will analyze the oxygen isotope composition of approximately 1,000 shell samples from modern snails collected along two selected transects that cross North America from southern Texas to Canada. They will identify the primary climatic controls on shell ï¿½18O values by quantifying the relation between shell ï¿½18O and relevant climatic variables (temperature, ï¿½18O of precipitation, precipitation amount, relative humidity) using an evaporative steady-state flux balance-mixing model developed for land snails. Researchers hypothesize that: (1) the oxygen isotope composition of small land snails in temperate environments (latitudes of 26 to 48 degrees N) primarily will reflect the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation, and therefore can be used to infer past changes in precipitation oxygen isotope values; and (2) shell oxygen isotope values of snails living in arid to semi-arid environments will yield higher values than predicted because of low relative humidity values. After calibration of the oxygen isotope systematics for living specimens, investigators will conduct two case studies to determine how well the oxygen isotope values of small snails track the oxygen isotope records of speleothems or other proxy records. The proposed work will allow better quantification of past climate change over broad areas of North America, and from many different types of deposits.","hot_pink"

In the postwar era, the microscope-based study of human chromosomes was a high-profile subject that promised to provide answers to urgent scientific, medical and political questions and attracted much funding and attention. Yet, the study of human chromosomes hardly plays a role in historical accounts of postwar genetics; molecular biology has taken much of the limelight. By following human chromosomes and the techniques and images that came packaged with them, it aims to reconstruct where human heredity mattered and genetic knowledge was embraced, debated, and rejected. The primary product of the research will be a book, accessible to wide readership in the history of science and technology, science studies and the life sciences. Historians will find a fresh perspective on an important chapter of twentieth century science. Biologists working in the field will gain a deeper understanding of the different strands of research that inform current genomic practices. The study will also be accessible to a more general readership, including science educators and policy makers, interested in looking beyond the story of the double helix to understand how heredity became an overriding concern in the late 20th and early 21st century. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The focus on human chromosomes provides a fresh vantage point from which to investigate the postwar history of human, medical and molecular genetics. The study will provide a novel understanding of several key issues. The focus on chromosomes allows the investigation to move beyond the limits of a disciplinary history and to trace the many contexts in which chromosome techniques were taken up and developed including radio-biological research, cancer research, toxicology, gender testing, criminology, world-wide population studies and in the policy arena. The study aims to recover these multiple uses of the new technology and to reconstruct the expectations placed on the new genetic technology. The study will also provide an integrated account of the history of postwar genetics by considering the place of microscopical practices next to molecular approaches in the postwar quest to study and harness heredity. While molecular biologists have long predicted the demise of cytogenetics, these practices have not only survived and thrived, especially in the field of comparative evolutionary genomics and in the clinical and drug discovery context. In light of these various facets, the research will have an impact on archival collecting practices. It will be shown that to document the history of postwar genetics for future historians it is necessary to have an inclusive view of the kind of objects and documents that make up this history.","crimson"

NCALM is a collaborative Facility with two nodes. The acquisition node and initial flight line trajectory calculations and ALSM data calibration functions are now located and performed at the University of Houston (UH) and the data processing, archival and distribution node is at the University of California at Berkeley (UC-B). Also known as airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), ALSM allows for the measurement of surface topographic features with decimeter-level accuracies and meter to sub-meter spatial resolution. High resolution, georeferenced, digital elevation models (DEMs) processed from raw ALSM data (point clouds) offer unprecedented observations of a multitude of geomorphic features at the scales at which fundamental shaping processes operate. Examples include, fault scarps, hill slopes, river channels, barrier beaches and sand dunes, mountain and continental glaciers, volcanic edifices and vegetative canopy structure. DEMs developed from ALSM can be used to model and advance understanding of the dynamics of surface landforms and the underlying processes responsible. The technique also has a wide range of applications in civil engineering and hazards assessments and for archaeological investigations of past civilizations modification of landscapes, especially in tropical environs where such structures are invisible via airborne photogrammetry. ALSM systems fire laser pulses (typically Nd:YAG at milliJoule powers) at high frequency from an aircraft whose position and orientation are accounted for via on board and ground GPS control and an aircraft IMU. The ALSM system measures the round trip travel time for individual pulses to reflect off encountered surfaces and return to a detector. The intensity of returns is also recorded on the UH GEMINI system. Raw ALSM travel time data is combined with ground Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver phase data and aircraft GPS and IMU data to generate xyz georeferenced coordinates of each laser return from the surface or ?point clouds.? The GEMINI system?s high frequency laser postings allows for penetration of dense vegetative canopies and, with developed post processing routines, can yield maps of both the upper surface of vegetative canopy and the bare Earth surface that is obstructed from a bird?s eye view. NCALM is dedicated to meeting three goals: 1) providing research-quality LiDAR data to the scientific community, 2) advancing the state of the art in airborne laser mapping, and 3) training and educating graduate students to meet the rapidly growing needs of academia, government, and the private sector. <br/><br/>***","hot_pink"

Billions of specimens (for example, plants, insects, and fossils) and their associated data (audio recordings of bird calls, field notes, geospatially referenced occurrence data, etc.) are held in more than 1000 biocollections across the United States. Until recently, these resources have largely been relegated to cabinets and drawers with few researchers, educators, or the public aware of their existence. The potential to digitally capture images of specimens and their associated data offers great promise to transform research on the environment, public health, food safety, commerce, and national security. Achieving the ambitious goal of digitizing the nation's biocollections and making them available to the broader community requires an organized, coordinated, and sustained effort. The resources created will engage a new community of users that cuts across traditional boundaries of biology, geology, computer science and software engineering and connects academic researchers with educators, policy makers, and the wider public. Cooperation with similar efforts overseas will result in a truly global resource. The purpose of this Research Coordination Network is to create such a community. <br/><br/>The NIBA Research Coordination Network will enable new research; create novel, cross-disciplinary user communities; and promote the development of software and cyberinfrastructure that will not only support collections digitization, but will have more general applicability far beyond the bounds of this field. Most importantly, it will create sustainable structures, capable of maintaining effort in this field over the long period required for full digitization of the nation's collections. The Steering Committee for the RCN will help to plan workshops and establish working committees that will evaluate and seek stakeholder input on the goals outlined in an Implementation Plan for a Network Integrated Biocollections Alliance (NIBA), a proposed mechanism for organizing and coordinating a sustained effort to digitally capture specimens and their associated data from biocollections. The RCN will engage the broader scientific community and public in an iterative process to evaluate the appropriateness and feasibility of the six goals articulated in the Implementation Plan for a NIBA, which include: 1) establishing an organizational and governance structure; 2) advancing engineering of the biodiversity collections cyberinfrastructure; 3) enhancing training of existing collections staff and creating the next generation of biodiversity information managers; 4) increasing participation from a broad range of stakeholders; 5) establish an enduring and sustainable knowledge base; and, 6) infusing specimen-based learning and exploration into formal and informal science education. The products of the workshops will include published reports and plans that will guide a national effort to build the infrastructure and implement NIBA. The new research communities and collaborations that are established through this RCN will stimulate the development of new tools, such as software or new data-mining techniques. As biocollections specimens and data become more publicly available, citizen scientists, government agency personnel, K-12 educators and many others will begin to access and use this information.

Understanding the machinery of large molecular assemblies has been significantly enhanced by the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technique. This technique allows the visualization of tens to over a thousand interacting molecules in an assembly and hence provides direct insights into important biological functions and mechanisms that cause abnormal function. The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) archives density images of molecular assemblies at resolutions ranging from 2ï¿½ to 100ï¿½ and the rapidly accumulating data are valuable resources for data mining for enhanced accuracy in interpretation. The research will concretely demonstrate the applicability of data mining the EMDB and the use of sophisticated graph algorithmic methods for better protein structure prediction. The computational methods and tools being developed can be used to interpret large molecular assemblies that have important biological functions such as viruses, membrane-bound channels and cellular machines. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for designing drugs and vaccines. The data mining and algorithmic techniques developed are very likely to be applicable for solving other computational problems, especially those dealing with searching large spaces and where one has to deal with data errors. Through the involvement of undergraduate researchers and summer high school students in the project, particularly women and those to be recruited from the African-American community, the project will contribute to the NSF goal of strengthening the pipeline and broadening participation in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to develop sequential and parallel computational methods and tools to derive atomic structures for EMDB density images at the mid-resolution range of 4-10ï¿½. Such methods will be generally applicable to determine the structure of proteins for which no existing templates can be identified. Novel ideas will be implemented in two difficult but critical steps in this problem. The first one addresses the long-standing challenge of accurately identifying &#946;-strands from density images. The second addresses the problem of finding the correct mapping of secondary structures (helices and &#946;-strands) in a density map to those identified on the protein sequence in presence of errors, making use of advanced computational methods. This project is a multidisciplinary effort bringing together expertise from computational structural biology, data mining, efficient algorithm design, and parallel computing. The methodology to be developed will be validated using experimentally derived cryo-EM density images and will be incorporated into Chimera, a popular 3D molecular viewer, for the cryo-EM community.<br/>The outcome of the project will be made available at the following website: http://www.cs.odu.edu/~jhe/","puce"

Conneticutt, EAR-1338256<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Overview: Vegetation-COï¿½2-climate feedbacks have been shown to be an important component of the climate system, capable of perturbing atmospheric circulation, continental surface temperatures, and hydrological cycling on regional- to global-scales. Recent work indicates that vegetation-climate feedbacks likely had the potential to push the late Paleozoic climate system between glacial and interglacial states and to strongly modify the climate regime within these states. The details of the nature, time-scales, and potential impact of these feedbacks remain elusive. This multi-disciplinary project, driven by three interlinked hypotheses, addresses these shortcomings and analyzes the roles of CO2- and orbital-forcing and vegetation-climate feedbacks in promoting glacial-interglacial transitions on eccentricity- to multi-million year time-scales: <br/>- The response of vegetation to primarily CO2-driven glacial-interglacial transitions depended on the timing, magnitude and duration of CO2 forcing and whether critical ecological thresholds were reached.<br/>- Tropical vegetation, by way of physiological forcing, impacted low-latitude climate and water & C cycling<br/>- Vegetation-climate feedbacks - on a global-scale - amplified radiatively forced glacial-interglacial transitions through changes in direct surface forcing and terrestrial C & N cycling.<br/>These hypotheses are being tested through integrated empirical, experimental and multi-scale modeling approaches across a spectrum of time- (10 to 1,000,000 yr) and spatial-scales (leaf-to-canopy-to-global climate system). Climate-CO2-vegetation feedbacks, including the role of plant physiological forcing of climate will be assessed through a two-stage modeling effort that will first reformulate a terrestrial biosphere model (BIOME-BGC) using the empirical and experimental results coupled with modeling sensitivity experiments to define plant functional traits for late Paleozoic PFTs. In the second stage, we will incorporate these PFT traits into NCAR's fully coupled Community Earth System Model and use this version to investigate glacial-interglacial dynamics.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This research will generate the first high-resolution, high-precision reconstruction of atmospheric CO2 during the LPIA, which when incorporated into the climate modeling will provide insight into the evolution of earth system processes, including the terrestrial biosphere, in an icehouse under changing CO2 levels relevant to our long-term future. This study will be the first modification of terrestrial biosphere models to account for paleo-PFT traits and investigation of paleovegetation-climate feedbacks thus providing an improved understanding of the potential of non-angiosperm plants to influence hydrologic and C cycling through physiological forcing. <br/>Broader Impacts: Cross-disciplinary training and mentoring will occur through in-residence internships for the Ph.D. students. Underrepresented students to Earth and environmental sciences will be integrated through a range of summer and academic year internships and programs at the collaborating institutions. This study will contribute directly to a Carboniferous exhibit planned for the Paleontological Halls of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. All data generated by this study will be archived and shared via publications, and web-accessible tools.","hot_pink"

But anthropologists have documented many cases where groups of human beings find other methods for pursuing sovereignty than through the formation of autonomous nation-states. This project asks what factors influence human beings to seek sovereignty through means other than political independence. The project would aid public policy experts in their efforts to understand and anticipate social movements not only in the United States, where this research is taking place, but in other parts of the world where sovereignty claims have taken new form. In addition, the project would strengthen collaboration among scientists in the mainland U.S. and Puerto Rico, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and train undergraduate and graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection. <br/><br/>Dr. Yarimar Bonilla of Rutgers University explores how notions of citizenship and national identity are reimagined within contexts of shifting and disputed forms of sovereignty. The research explores the Puerto Rican statehood movement, an important site for answering this question as the movement has paradoxically gained popularity among those who have advocated other forms of sovereign status over annexation and statehood. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States has long been ambiguous and misunderstood. Famously described as ""foreign in a domestic sense,"" Puerto Rico is a space where notions of citizenship nationality are hotly debated. For many years the island's commonwealth status promised local residents ""the best of both worlds"" in the sense of offering US citizenship with a measure of local sovereignty. However, as the economy has stagnated over the past twenty years leading to failing infrastructure, a seemingly unpayable public debt, and historic levels of out-migration (resulting in a larger concentration of Puerto Ricans in the continental United States than in the Puerto Rican territory), a growing number of Puerto Ricans currently support political annexation to the United States. This project will examines how and why a large number of Puerto Ricans advocate for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state. Utilizing data collected through archival research, participant observation, surveys, focus groups and individual interviews, the PI will examine how statehood is imagined by its advocates and what problems it is deemed capable of solving. The findings of this research will have broad implications for thinking about the cultural meanings of citizenship in an era of shifting sovereignty and about the current landscape of political possibility in the United States and its margins.","maroon"

In recent years, a number of studies have shown that this state of affairs is not necessarily optimal. However, in a given porous medium, saturation and interfacial areas are independent variables, i.e., many different configurations resulting in a range of interfacial areas are possible for a single saturation. Awareness of this effect of interfacial forces on multi-phase flow has led to the development of alternative theories based on fundamental thermodynamic considerations in which interfacial areas are introduced as separate thermodynamic entities. Thus capillary pressure becomes a function of both saturation and specific fluid-fluid interfacial area and it has been suggested that the system will be uniquely described by this functional dependence. Recent work has indicated that a single unique surface cannot indisputably describe two-phase flow under nonequilibrium conditions, suggesting that there may be something else missing from the theory. The goal of the proposed work is to improve on a paucity of delicate measurements and generate highly unique data sets from which strategic advances can be made on a number of fronts with respect to the fundamental dynamics of multi-phase flow in porous media. The data generated will consist of dynamic drainage and imbibition experiments during which x-ray tomographic images will be captured such that the fluid phases can be tracked in unprecedented detail in three dimensions. This will allow for measurement of developing interfacial areas, curvatures, and trapping behavior of the fluid phases. This novel data set can be used in a combined effort to validate findings based on multi-phase theories and for a broader exploration of interfacial dynamics, in particular the formation of interfacial area and curvature evolution. <br/><br/>Improved understanding of the physics of multi-phase flow in porous media has societal impacts through applications in various fields such as groundwater management and remediation, soil and agricultural science, petroleum engineering, and geologic sequestration of CO2. This project aims to generate new data set that will not only first and foremost support progress in understanding the role of interfaces, and their dynamic behavior, on porous media flow and transport, but also improve on existing theories describing these processes. The generated high-resolution imagery will be made available to the broader scientific community through digital archiving. Ultimately, this will allow for improved management of natural resources and ability to reliably engineer porous systems leading to improvements in water usage and energy development.","hot_pink"

While substantial knowledge exists on individual generation technologies, less is understood regarding the place-specific impacts of these technologies on the urban environment. To address this, this project will develop an integrated building simulation and optimization framework to study the interaction between distributed power generation installations and the built environment in cities. The framework will be used to understand feedback mechanism associated with changing supply and demand mixtures in real cities. Specifically, an understanding will be gained on how urban infrastructure and microclimate affect energy demands and how effectively and economically a simple local generation system can meet those demands. The focus will be on two commonly used and technologically mature prime movers, solar photovoltaic arrays and natural gas turbine-generator sets. Four U.S. cities, representing a range of climate types and average electricity prices, will be used as case studies to test the system: Atlanta, Minneapolis, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City. <br/><br/>There is a critical need to understand the complex interactions and tradeoffs between demand moderating urban form options, and distributed power generation opportunities. The hypothesis of this research is that a site-specific optimal mix of distributed power generation and microscale building demand reduction strategies exists that can minimize both internal and external costs resulting in more sustainable cities. Previous work using the QUIC-EnvSim package has demonstrated the importance of considering the built environment together with its local, natural environment for calculating energy and mass fluxes in the urban environment. Similarly, meeting the energy demands of a building should depend on consideration of the building's environment and neighboring buildings. EnergyPlus is a well known tool capable of performing detailed individual building simulations, available from the DOE. In this project, the two simulation packages will be dynamically coupled in such a way that building simulations conducted in EnergyPlus will use QUIC-EnvSim environmental data, and building performance calculations from EnergyPlus will inform the QUIC simulations. The coupled system will be integrated within a decision making framework to enable hypothesis testing regarding site-specific optimal mixes of distributed power generation. These simulation tools will be developed in a Multi-criteria Decision Making environment designed to aid urban planners, engineers and architects in designing buildings and surrounding landscaping in ways that integrate best with distributed generation capacity. Through workshops, stakeholder's input will be directly integrated into the project, enabling a more fluid integration with practitioners. The understanding gained from this project will guide utility companies and public utility planners in developing plans for expanding power generation in urban areas while reducing the investment risk associated with additional central generation capacity. Further, the knowledge gained from this project will help communities and developers in placing distributed power generation within existing groups of buildings in a way that provides an economic benefit to the power consumers. Simulation data results for the cities and scenarios will be made available in an archival form to researchers, and the modified EnergyPlus-QUIC-EnvSim model will be released upon request, along with the custom power generation packages and instructions for developing and incorporating other types of DG. This project will provide interdisciplinary training in engineering, computer science, economics, urban planning, and energy policy for graduate students directly via involvement in the project, as well as more broadly to engineering students through a new Energy Systems course that will be developed. A summer outreach program will also be developed to target underrepresented groups.","coral"

The rate and extent to which it decreases has implications for shipping, mineral development, climate, and national defense. Models can be used to predict the future with some accuracy, but we know that existing models cannot yet fully reproduce observed changes in sea ice extent. Another approach is to look for analogs in the past. What was the sea cover like in the geologic past? Was the Arctic ice free under previous warm atmospheric conditions? Using independent estimates such as from ice cores, it is known when the Arctic was warm in the past. This project will develop an estimator, or proxy, for sea surface temperature. This is based on single-celled organisms known as foraminifera that live in the surface waters of the ocean. When the proxy indicates that sea surface temperature was higher than the melting point of sea ice, we know that sea ice was not present.<br/><br/>In the course of completing this research project, contributions will be made to training the next generation of scientists, as well as to informing the broader population about the Arctic. Partial support of a postdoctoral researcher on this project will allow her to broaden her scientific expertise and international experience. An undergraduate student involved in this work will also receive valuable training in many technical aspects of the research. Collaboration with scientists from several countries will aid in fostering broader international cooperation in the Arctic. Results of this research will enrich the content of courses taught by the principal investigator.

Funds are provided to characterize Arctic paleo sea surface temperatures based on the composition of planktic foraminiferal species and their magnesium/calcium ratios in sediment samples from the Fram Strait (the Arctic-Atlantic gateway) and the central Arctic Ocean. This research will involve close collaboration with several national and international partners to ensure sample exchange, interlaboratory data compatibility, and a broad context for interpretation. <br/><br/>Achieving the project goals involves several methodological and data-producing steps, including (1) development of the optimal cleaning/measuring procedure for Mg/Ca analysis on fragile tests of subpolar planktic foraminifers, (2) calibration of Mg/Ca to modern hydrography using improved assemblage-based transfer functions, and (3) reconstruction of paleo temperatures at high-resolution (decadal to century-scale) using Holocene cores from the Fram Strait, as well as warming/ice-reduction events in the central Arctic Ocean (e.g., Marine Isotope Stages 1, 5, and 11). This research will provide insights into the extent of surface warming and sea-ice retreat in the Arctic Ocean during past climate amelioration events, as well as the short-term variability in the export of sea ice and polar waters during the Holocene. It will also contribute to understanding the response of Arctic biota, exemplified by planktic foraminifers, to climatic warming and sea-ice reduction. The resultant data sets will be made available through appropriate public archives.","plum"

The project will consider the evolution and operation of a major economic sector from new perspectives. It will expand on the consideration of metabolism by moving beyond traditional considerations that focus on industrial process to consider inputs and outputs among a broader suite of natural and human systems, thereby permitting consideration of the role of natural systems in terms of impacting on and receiving outputs from industrial processes. The project will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the processes though which atmospheric nitrogen has been transformed into a commodity as well as they ways in which this economic enterprise has evolved and interacted with various natural and human systems. The project therefore will expand knowledge about the role of social and other human factors in the transformation of global biogeochemical flows. The project is expected to result in a range of products that will enhance fundamental theoretical understandings and yield practical benefits. A book and other publications will be disseminated to groups like the Fertilizer Institute, the Food and Agriculture Organization, The Earth Institute, the Center for Industrial Ecology, and the National Coalition for Sustainable Agriculture among other organizations in civil society and industry, The investigators also will develop special educational materials, including teaching modules that deal with the social and natural aspects of the nitrogen cycle and illustrate the technical process of taking fossil fuel and creating nitrogen fertilizer in industrial facilities as well as the larger relationships this industry has with society and the environment.<br/><br/>Scientists consider the ""Haber-Bosch Process"" of synthetic nitrogen production to be one of the most fundamental innovations of the 20th century. The process revolutionized global food production by lifting previous limitations on natural sources of nitrogen fertilizer, usually manure. The process has several sustainability concerns, however, because of its reliance on nonrenewable inputs, especially natural gas, water pollution, and excessive flows of nutrients into water bodies that can lead to eutrophication and phenomena like marine ""dead zones."" The process also yields significant levels of carbon emission and raises thorny questions regarding relationships between levels of food production and population growth. As such, nitrogen cuts across the energy-water-food nexus of environmental challenges. The investigators will combine an ""input-output"" analysis more traditionally employed in industrial ecology with a three-step research design focused on the historical and social dynamics of the primary ""input"" (natural gas), the industrial and related processes occurring at a representative site (Donaldsonville, Louisiana), and the primary ""outputs"" (nitrogen fertilizer and carbon dioxide). They will employ a range of methodological approaches, including archival research, interviews, and field-based observations.","maroon"

In addition, algae predominated in late Paleozoic marine ecosystems. These observations, combined with predictions from climate modeling, prompt two over-arching hypotheses driving the proposed research: 1) the unusual tropical dustiness reflects dust production by tropical upland glaciers, and 2) atmospheric dustiness fertilized marine ecosystems. Dust forces the climate system by affecting radiative forcing and atmospheric moisture, and by influencing the biosphere, but these effects are poorly known. In this research, PIs will collect data to constrain spatial (low-mid latitude) and temporal (glacial-interglacial and longer) variations in atmospheric 'dustiness,' sources of the dust, and influences between dust and ecosystem composition in order to address their over-arching hypotheses, and clarify the relationships among atmospheric dustiness, climate, and the biosphere.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/>This research will reveal process links among dust, climate, and the biosphere within an icehouse, at glacial-interglacial scales. Owing to the known importance but great uncertainty of both the direct and indirect effects of dust on climate, results will expand understanding of Earth-system behavior. Tropical glaciation at low elevations implies much more widespread glaciation than currently accepted, and --if verified-- would force the community to test this hypothesis with new modeling approaches. The models to be used are identical to those used for present and future climate, and thus improvements made through the proposed work will inform modeling of Earth's climate in general. If the hypothesis that atmospheric dustiness forced marine biotic systems toward nutrient-rich conditions is confirmed, it implies a remarkably dusty Earth, and clarifies Earth-system behavior to dust-sourced fertilization. These results are relevant to growing discussions regarding geo-engineering schemes to control future climate change. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>Cross-disciplinary training will occur via exchanges between geological and geochemical labs, geologists and modelers, and in joint field excursions and progress meetings. PhD students will mentor middle-school teachers through a formal summer program. Undergraduates will conduct senior theses and present at Undergraduate Research Day and national meetings. Both will interact with middle- and high-school students through a formal course on STEM education. The lead investigators will use components of the research to teach at university levels, as well as in museum, and community outreach. Ties will be established and strengthened among all participant institutions, which includes an Historically Black University, as well as international partners. This research will help ignite the research careers of three young investigators (2 with no prior NSF support).

This separation lacks the insights that structural information can bring to the design and modeling process, and makes the modeling of physical artifacts difficult and inefficient. The PI's goal in this project is to alleviate this problem by establishing a research program in a new field of structural geometry processing, a cross-pollination of digital geometry processing and structural engineering, which will infuse structural information into all stages of geometric modeling, from scanning to reconstruction to editing and design, and which will lead to more efficient 3D models with a higher degree of accuracy and realism that behave in a physically-correct manner. 3D printing and digital fabrication have started a revolution in design and manufacturing; the emergence of desktop 3D printers has delivered widespread accessibility to non-experts for realizing complex objects. This research will allow the development of more robust, reliable, and usable tools for creating digital content. Aside from their direct relevance to computer graphics, the geometry processing technologies to be developed here will also have applicability to cultural heritage applications, opening up new possibilities for archiving and visualizing historic sites, and for analyzing the stability and safety of historic masonry buildings that have survived for centuries. The PI's interdisciplinary approach will also open new areas of research in the respective fields of geometry processing and structural engineering. <br/><br/>This research will impact three core thrusts: structurally-informed 3D geometry acquisition; geometric modeling and design of stable structures; and prototyping with 3D fabrication. This first thrust will develop new methods to capture the geometry of large architectural sites by exploiting structural priors. Scans often suffer from missing information due to obstructions and inherent construction limitations. The PI will improve on reconstruction methods from scan data by incorporating constraints for structurally-correct, and hence more faithful, digital representations of buildings. Algorithms will be developed to automatically translate captured surface geometry into volumetric mass models that can be analyzed by structural mechanics methods. The second thrust will develop the foundation for a new class of Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) tools that harmoniously integrate structural objectives. Advances in surface and volumetric modeling have had wide influence in engineering and design. While contemporary buildings now feature an explosion of free-form shapes, these expressive shapes are often achieved at the expense of high material and construction costs. Existing software lacks the ability to aid designers in improving geometry, for example, to reduce internal forces and required material. The PI will investigate shape optimization methods for exploring energy landscapes linked with structural constraints. The third thrust will validate the optimized geometry from the first two thrusts using digital fabrication technology. The process of turning a virtual model into a physical artifact is subject to many constraints. The PI will develop computational tools to address problems in robustness, economic use of material, and printability for large-scale prototypes. Scaled 3D printed models will enable effective physical validation of the modeling concepts previously discussed.","indigo"

A key species in this ecosystem is Antarctic krill, which in addition to being commercially harvested, is the principle prey of a wide range of marine organisms including penguins, seals and whales. The aim of this study is to use penguins and other krill predators as sensitive indicators of past changes in the Antarctic marine food web resulting from climate variability and the historic harvesting of seals and whales by humans. Specifically this study will recover and analyze modern (<20 year old), historic (20-200 year old) and ancient (200-10,000 year old) penguin and other krill predator tissues to track their past diets and population movements relative to shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill. The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry. In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.<br/><br/>This research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting. This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene. This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill.","plum"

Genomics has qualitatively improved our ability to investigate biological dynamics and to make important discoveries that are the foundations for understanding topics such as environmental change, developing and protecting crops, and improving health outcomes. Genome analysis, however, is a significant challenge for the practicing biologist. Most biologists who need to undertake genome science are not sufficiently expert in the relevant analytical tools, or understand the complex workflows required to get from the initial data generated by sequencers to a biologically meaningful analyzed result. In addition, few have access to the supercomputing resources and large-scale storage required for processing and managing genomics data. The National Center for Genome Analysis Support (NCGAS) addresses these challenges by providing an integrated service comprised of expert consulting and educational services, hardened and optimized software available through easy to use web-based workflow management tools, large memory supercomputers, and large scale data storage and publishing facilities. These resources are particularly useful for researchers from smaller, and minority serving, institutions that typically do not have access to the required expertise and cyberinfrastructure, yet whose investigations are equally important. Since its inception in 2011, the NCGAS has supported over 80 research projects representing over $61M in funded research. It engaged in 51 training events that served 691 individuals, of which 241 were from traditionally underserved populations.<br/><br/>The NCGAS (http://ncgas.org) was established in 2011 through a National Science Foundation ABI development award to help the national research community complete genomics research that requires data management and computational infrastructures at scale. NCGAS is a partnership among the Indiana University Pervasive Technology Institute, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, the Texas Advanced Computing Center, and the San Diego Supercomputing Center. It meets the technology challenges of modern genome science by providing excellent bioinformatics consulting services for genome analysis, particularly genome and transcriptome assembly, including research design, data analysis and visualization. It optimizes, supports, and delivers genome analysis software on national supercomputing systems such as those funded by the NSF eXtreme Digital (XD) program and coordinated by the eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) and the Open Science Grid (OSG). The NCGAS maintains and supports easy-to-use gateways, including Galaxy web portals, for genome analysis workflows that lower barriers for scientist to create, execute, document, and share genomics analyses. It distributes software tools for genome analysis to research computing facilities and the general research community so that IT managers can more easily install these tools on their systems. It provides long-term archival storage services. The NCGAS provides a digital library resource for the dissemination of data sets, publications, reports, or collections of files that will allow research to be visible and data to be re-used for decades to come. It delivers education and outreach programs on genome analysis, interpretation, and data management to biology faculty and students nationally. These programs will enhance the technology literacy of practicing scientists and help grow the bioinformatics workforce. These services are particularly available to smaller institutions across the country without access to supercomputers, bioinformatics expertise, or training. The NCGAS will enable breakthroughs that would not be possible without advanced cyberinfrastructure support.","puce"

These tools are highly sophisticated and refined, but they often have been revised following many major past earthquakes to incorporate the lessons learned from post-event observations and investigations. Thus, the validity of these tools is yet to be fully established. The Liquefaction Experiments and Analysis Projects (LEAP) is an international collaboratory to produce a set of high quality experimental data using centrifuge testing, and then to use these data to establish the validity and range of applicability of existing computational models and simulation procedures for soil liquefaction analysis. The collaboratory includes centrifuge facilities at the University of California at Davis, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Cambridge University (UK), Kyoto University (Japan), NCU (Taiwan), Zhejiang University (China), IFSTTAR (France), KAIST and KWater (Korea), and HKUST (Hong Kong). The project leverages the experimental resources at these facilities to complement the testing capabilities in the participating US institutions for investigating a number of challenging problems in which soil liquefaction plays a prominent role.<br/><br/>Three consecutive projects (LEAP-2017, -2018, and -2019) are planned which will be used to address three important issues: reproducibility and uncertainty; effects of soil fabric; and effects of biaxial ground motion on soil liquefaction. LEAP-2017 will use improved quality control measures to minimize uncertainties, and an extensive testing program will be designed and conducted to characterize the sensitivity and uncertainty for relatively simple lateral spreading centrifuge tests. LEAP-2018 will produce high quality centrifuge data to enable the assessment of the applicability of computational tools for predicting the influence of fabric and layering. LEAP-2019 will assess the performance of numerical tools against a series of biaxial shaking centrifuge experiments using synthetic and real earthquake motions. Following each LEAP, a workshop will be held to discuss the results of experiments and numerical simulations. The data resulting from this project will be organized, archived and publically released using a new database publication mechanism. The organized data will be useful for (1) future validation efforts, (2) other ongoing liquefaction research, and (3) in geotechnical modeling education. A number of graduate students are involved in the project and will receive unique training opportunities beyond the capabilities of any one institution alone. A Validation Driver Framework (VDF) will be developed to allow modelers as well as practitioners to efficiently validate their codes.","navy_blue"

The project will develop a framework to enhance understanding of the roots of resource conflict and facilitate meaningful participation in efforts to resolve these types of conflicts. The project will expand capabilities for transdisciplinary and intercultural methods in the field of environmental monitoring. The project will facilitate enhanced contact between indigenous people and environmental agencies, which holds potential to advance innovative water, air, soil, and wildlife monitoring techniques that recognize the environmental knowledge of indigenous communities. It will help to advance equitable modes for indigenous participation in science, thereby creating new avenues to alleviate resource-based conflict, reduce environmental risks, and produce more relevant and accessible monitoring of environmental conditions and implications. More broadly, the project will constitute an integrative activity that may help reconcile relationships between governmental units in nations like the U.S. and Canada and their indigenous communities. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>State-led projects to integrate both indigenous and conventional monitoring techniques have become a popular mode to resolve conflict, and many have demonstrated that meaningful integration of indigenous knowledge with conventional monitoring offers possibilities for more credible and culturally relevant understandings of environment change. At the same time, such projects may be seen to conceal broader societal inequalities and unequal decision-making power. In northern Alberta, for example, environmental monitoring of the tar sands has been viewed by critics as a political process that advances dominant cultural and economic agendas. This research project will examine new participatory strategies that seek to bridge conventional monitoring with community-based understandings of the environment. The doctoral student conducting this project will study environmental agencies that monitor tar sands production as a case study to investigate the shifting power relations between First Nation communities and the state. He will employ interviews, Q methodology, and archival document analysis to explore answers to the following sets of questions: (1) How has environmental degradation been conceptualized among First Nation communities and Alberta monitoring agencies? (2) In what ways have the monitoring practices of Alberta's environmental agencies changed over time? (3) How has community participation with monitoring programs shaped agency findings and recommendations? Examination of the evolution of tar sands monitoring by state agencies will provide new insights into the competing cultural and economic agendas that structure conceptions of environmental change by different groups.","maroon"

The researcher is building an argument to show that the philosophical tradition of pragmatism owes an enormous debt to specific biological debates in the late 1800s, especially those concerning the role of the environment in development and evolution. He is drawing from both published writings from the period as well as extensive archival evidence to make his case. The main potential benefit to society of this project is to change the conversation about the relationship between biology and the social world. The current conversation about this relationship is dominated by socio-biologists and evolutionary psychologists, whose work has been roundly criticized by philosophers of science. Pragmatism provides an alternative model: Although we are, fundamentally, organisms modifying and being modified by our environments, in the contexts of science, ethics, and education, the environments that matter are social, and thus it is social science rather than biology that bears directly on these contexts.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This research project will demonstrate that we cannot fully understand pragmatism and its influence without understanding its connection to biology. For example, the pragmatists used the dichotomy of ""organism and environment"" as an abstract framing device, applying it in logic, ethics, and even aesthetics. This organism-environment framework brought together biology, philosophy, and the social sciences, resulting in pioneering work such as that of W.E.B. Du Bois, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), which argued that many of the problems of the black community in Philadelphia were due to their social environment. The pragmatist philosophers were influential across a range of fields, from education to sociology. William James, after opening the first United States laboratory devoted to the teaching of psychology at Harvard, published one of the discipline's most influential textbooks; John Dewey, an outspoken champion of progressive education, founded what is now known as the Laboratory School at the University of Chicago; George Herbert Mead, one of the fathers of social psychology, motivated the sociological approach of symbolic interactionism. By revealing its roots in nineteenth-century biology, this project promises to transform our understanding of American pragmatism, and to enhance our understanding of the critical role of social environments.","crimson"

The project focuses on a large protein complex called Mediator, which selectively turns on subsets of genes in both yeast and mammalian cells. Two central questions will be addressed. First, how does Mediator select and turn on its gene targets? Second, how does Mediator action in yeast compare to its action in mammalian cells? The comparative approach used in this project will have broad impact on fundamental understanding of gene activity in ""simple"" yeast versus ""complex"" mammalian cells. Some of the results will be in the form of ""big data""--large data sets that describe molecular interactions across an entire genome--and these will be deposited in public archives where they can be freely accessed by scientists and the public. In addition, the project will provide training for undergraduates, a postdoctoral fellow, and two female graduate students, one of whom is a member of an underrepresented minority.<br/><br/>The Mediator protein complex consists of over twenty interacting proteins and is found in all cells with nuclei (eukaryotes). Mediator is known to play a critical gene activating role via association with the machinery responsible for RNA synthesis (transcription). However, how Mediator locates its gene targets and exactly what it does when it finds them, are not completely understood. This project will address these issues in three aims. The first will test the idea that proteins belonging to the general transcription machinery help Mediator to find its targets. The approach will be to compare Mediator association with its targets in normal yeast cells and in mutants in which components of the general transcription machinery are impaired, using a method called ChIP-seq that identifies where proteins associate with DNA across an entire genome. The second aim will follow up on previous results that suggested that Mediator association with different targets is related to differential dynamics--how fast Mediator finds its targets and how often and rapidly it leaves again. This idea will be tested using variations of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP, the basis of ChIP-seq) that provide information on binding dynamics. These first two aims will be done using the model system of baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which is easy to work with but is quite similar to mammalian cells in its molecular makeup. In the third aim, the effect of impairing function of specific subunits of Mediator in mammalian cells on gene transcription will be tested by ""knocking down"" expression of those subunits and measuring the effect on genome-wide transcription by high throughput sequencing. In yeast, this has been a productive strategy for understanding how Mediator structure relates to its function. Comparing the results obtained in mammalian cells will reveal similarities and differences with yeast, and thereby reveal the value and limitations of knowledge gained using the yeast system.","medium_blue"

By 2025, that number is expected to climb to 440 million households, representing 1.6 billion people. This interdisciplinary research project will analyze the ramifications of accelerating urbanization and rising housing costs in global perspective. By focusing on several major cities that are responding to affordable housing shortages in different ways, this project will provide new understanding regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of different government policies. The research team will generate new data and analyses about processes of global urbanization, the relationship between housing and poverty, and the large-scale environmental impact of expanding cities. The project will produce policy-relevant findings regarding the effectiveness and unanticipated consequences of various strategies, policies, and responses. The researchers will document how the development of certain ideas and laws helped to contribute to the current crisis, which will provide lessons for planners and other decision makers. The project also will catalogue the human costs of the crisis and record how housing policies work on a day-to-day basis, offering policy makers new insights into the complex nature of the problem.<br/><br/>Through their analysis of four cities on four different continents (New York in the U.S., London in the United Kingdom, Lagos in Nigeria, and Delhi in India), the investigators will identify key sources of the global affordable housing crisis by exploring the historical record, present-day strategies of housing provision, and a range of social and environmental transformations taking place in territories far removed from the city. They will document multiple consequences of the affordable housing crisis, including historical processes of dispossession and land enclosure, present-day survival strategies of low-income families in high-cost cities, and broader trends of accelerated urbanization. They also will assess why cities have responded to the affordable housing crisis in vastly different ways as well as the consequences of those varied responses for low-income families, cities, and surrounding environments. The investigators will analyze infrastructure and property relations, urban poverty and housing market dynamics, migration patterns, and flows of capital and other resources. Historical geoparsing algorithms will analyze a large textual database of archival sources that document the worldwide contestation of property rights in the 20th century. Ethnographic fieldwork in the four focal cities will document the everyday lives of low-income residents and analyze how different housing policies play out on the ground level. Macrospatial and geographic methods will map large-scale data about infrastructural systems to connect cities and their hinterlands, highlighting territories and resource.

This research project investigates the relationship between race and waste in industrialized societies, through a case study of aluminum production in North Carolina. The study examines how race and waste have allowed aluminum to become a vital and valuable material in the modern U.S. The investigators will analyze how racism has shaped work, social life and politics in an aluminum company town, drawing on the insights and supporting the efforts of impacted underprivileged residents. This detailed empirical and historical study of a small town in the American South will contribute theoretical understanding to a wide range of disciplines, including critical and feminist geopolitics, historical geography, environmental studies, American Studies, and critical race studies. Collaborative and arts-based methods will make research accessible and engage broader audiences in environmental justice education. <br/><br/>In scholarship on toxic exposure and hazardous environments, race is frequently taken for granted, included as one variable among many or an unintended by-product of larger structural issues. This research centralizes structural racism in 20th century capitalism, a period in which aluminum played a key role in establishing the U.S. as a global military and economic power. The case study focuses on Badin, North Carolina, one of the first aluminum smelters in the U.S and a segregated company town that is the site of a contemporary environmental justice struggle. Using a combination of archival and ethnographic methods to examine 100 years of Badin?s history (1915-2015), this research investigates and contributes to scholarship on waste, structural racism, and environmental justice politics. The investigators examine multiple wastes in Badin, from the chemical by-products of aluminum smelting and the unmarked toxic dumps, to the bodies of workers and environmental resources that are ?wasted? in order to make usable aluminum. They trace how different actors over the course of Badin?s history negotiated, defined and challenged what was considered valuable and what was marginalized as waste. The study explores how segregation and anti-Black racism have impacted the social life and the physical environment in Badin over time and what it means for affected communities to build political participation through suffering and illness caused by toxic exposure. Through participant-observation of Badin community negotiations to redress contamination, and drawing on interviews with key stakeholders in regional environmental justice politics, the study examines the potential for racial and environmental justice in the U.S. today.","maroon"

The project will address specifically how programs designed to augment both water and food security in the aftermath of civil war may actually facilitate further conflict and violence. Water-management projects, including the intensification and expansion of irrigation schemes, well illustrate this dynamic. It is widely understood that water management issues have a bearing on post-conflict societies. However, much of the literature presumes that armed conflict contributes to the destruction of these schemes whereas peace-building efforts improve such schemes. This relationship is not so straightforward, in that many post-conflict practices may lead to renewed, but altered, forms of conflict and violence. This project therefore will provide insight into the complex dynamics of armed conflict, post-conflict rebuilding processes, and the impact on the environment. This has important implications in that resource scarcities, including that of water, are assumed to lead to more conflict in the future.<br/><br/>Through the use of recent advances in geospatial technologies, coupled with archival research, this project provides an empirically-grounded, scientific approach to the interplay of conflict and the environment. Drawing on theoretical insights developed in environmental security studies, specifically water and food security studies, this project will advance basic knowledge on deforestation that results from the construction of irrigation schemes in a post-conflict setting. Investigators will focuses on the case study of Khmer Rouge irrigation projects that were developed during the Cambodian genocide. This study is important in that it provides a real-world empirical example from which to examine actual policies and their subsequent impact on the environment.

The event will be held in conjunction with the IEEE VIS 2016 meeting, which is comprised of the IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), the IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Conference (VAST), and the International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security, and which will take place during the week of October 23-28 in Baltimore, MD. Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. IEEE VIS is the premier forum for advances in scientific and information visualization; this weeklong event convenes an international community of researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to explore their shared interests in tools, techniques, and technology, and is now attended by over 1,200 visualization professionals from around the world. The papers presented at the various component events are rigorously refereed and widely cited. More information is available online at http://www.ieeevis.org. The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS, a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually since 2006, has been highly successful in providing a forum for introducing and grooming young scholars in the field. Many of today's leading visualization researchers have participated in earlier doctoral colloquia as students. The event brings together the best of the next generation of visualization researchers and allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, gender, ethnicity, scientific discipline, institution, and research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. The organizers strongly commit to achieving diversity among the student participants; to this end, no more than 2 students will be accepted from any one institution, and 2 students from the same institution will only be accepted if at least one of them is a woman. The PI has further affirmed that NSF funds will be used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States.<br/><br/>In 2016 the workshop will convene on Saturday, October 22 (the day before the main conference), with follow-up events throughout the week during the VIS technical program. A primary objective is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. To this end, the 18 students will be split into three groups of 6 students; two faculty panelists and one DC co-chair will be assigned to each group in individual meeting rooms to hold their presentations. Each student will be allotted approximately 30-40 minutes of time during the group sessions, to include a formal presentation about his/her doctoral research followed by in-depth discussions and feedback. All students will be assigned a specific mentor among the expert panelists, who will be responsible for reading the student's submission materials in particular depth and providing detailed feedback; additional feedback will be given by other members of the faculty panel, as well as by fellow student participants. Discussion is encouraged. The feedback is geared to helping student participants understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other visualization research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, whether their results are being appropriately analyzed and presented, etc. The goal is to give a second opinion on each student's doctoral research beyond the guidance provided by the student's own dissertation advisor. There will be a common catered working lunch on site for all participants (students and panelists alike) where students get an additional opportunity to meet and network with the expert panelists on a more individual level. Finally, at the end of the day, there will be a roundtable discussion where all participants meet and discuss higher-level topics beyond technical research. Student research will be disseminated via posters during the VIS technical program, and via publication in the VIS Extended Abstracts. The organizers will file a final report (with feedback from participants), which will be archived by the VIS Executive Committee and provided to the organizers of future doctoral colloquia.","indigo"

Complementary approaches will be used, including microdialysis, pharmacological manipulations, and neuronal activation, to elucidate interactions between AVP and GABA systems in the lateral septum and AVP-mediated alterations in neuronal activation in projection areas of the lateral septum. The results will provide new insights on the regulation of social interactions among juveniles, which are known to be critically important for development of social competence and socialization in mammals, including rodents and humans. <br/><br/>The research will be integrated with an education plan in which new initiatives will be developed to expose high school and undergraduate students, particularly those from minority and under-represented groups, to hands-on behavioral neuroscience research. The research and education plans will build a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to behavioral neuroscience research and education. Research findings will be disseminated to the public through public lectures, publications, and a web site.

Neuropeptides regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes. Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult. This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of animal experiments and computational models. Field and laboratory studies will be combined to address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of male vertebrate behaviors. The agent-based modeling approach is especially well-suited to address this problem. Synthetic experiments with the model allow for exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests. The model is expected to propose novel mechanisms underlying neuropeptide control of behavior. This project thus implements a tightly controlled experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach towards understanding social behavior. Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. Conserved behaviors and chemical messengers will make the empirical results and the model broadly applicable to vertebrates. Results will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on vertebrate behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (with a 30% minority makeup) and training of graduate students in a unique inter-disciplinary environment. The data management plan includes deposition of new software at SourceForge and archiving of digital data in the PI's institutional databases.","teal"

Geothermal springs vary dramatically in their environmental characteristics and these gradients (e.g. temperature, pH) make hotsprings 'model' systems for understanding the ecological distributions of micro-eukaryotic communities. This project will investigate microbes in New Zealand hotspring ecosystems to characterize microbial eukaryotic communities. New Zealand is ideally suited for this work as it is home to thousands of unique hotspring ecosystems. This scientific bioinventory will be useful for scientists and policy makers to assess ecosystem uniqueness, biotechnology potential, and ecosystem health. This is particularly relevant given strong current interest in harnessing geothermal hotsprings for energy. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Craig Cary at the University of Waikato and Dr. Matthew Stott at GNS Science, experts in microbial ecology and hot spring ecosystems. <br/><br/>Eukaryotic microbes (e.g. protists) are abundant and critical to ecosystem functioning, yet remain poorly characterized in hotsprings. This study will use archived samples from fifty geothermal hot springs collected from the Taupo&#772; Volcanic Zone (TVZ) in New Zealand that represent extreme gradients in temperature (13- 100.6ï¿½C), pH (0- 9.7) to search for novel eukaryotic diversity and test hypotheses on how environmental parameters shape microbial eukaryotic communities in geothermal environments. High-throughput DNA sequencing combined with microscopic analyses will be used to yield one of the first assessments of the microbial eukaryotic communities in geothermal environments. Although the bacteria and archaea found in hotsprings and other geothermal environments have been studied for decades, there are no comprehensive study of the microbial eukaryotic diversity found in these environments despite increasing evidence that they can be abundant and active. Thus, this project will contribute to our understanding of the biodiversity of hotspring systems and whether there are endemic eukaryotic microbial taxa found in these ecosystems. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.","chartreuse"

This CAREER project undertakes a unique response to language endangerment by exploring innovative methods of language documentation that also involve and benefit diverse populations. The project encompasses collaborative, multi-institutional field investigations of the four tribal languages Nyeshangte, Gyalsumdo, Manang-Gurung and Nar-Phu in order to merge traditional documentation methods with cutting-edge visualization tools. Investigators will adapt approaches from other studies of language and dialect variation by building a web-accessible, multi-media atlas to chart the rich language histories, variation, and attitudes found in Manang. This output will represent a new approach to documentation, one with a geographic perspective to chart structural details, threats, survival scenarios and future prospects within and across these languages. The project will also provide essential learning tools about, and for, language endangerment and survival scenarios in Nepal. One focus group will be undergraduate university students, who represent influential global citizens who would otherwise encounter issues of endangerment and preservation only in a detached context of textbooks and lecture. Project methods will embrace a collaborative spirit, including work with Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu, and with trained assistants in the Manang District. The project will also involve work with colleagues and students in the Geographic Information Systems program at the home institution. University students are involved in all phases of data collection and analysis, and in the design of pedagogical materials.

The research supported by this award seeks to answer a complementary question: If urbanism and globalism are so important, why is it that rural communities also produce politically active citizens? It is an important question whose answer will help to better understand the functioning of participatory democracies throughout the world. <br/><br/>To address this question, Rutgers University anthropology doctoral student, Nada El-Kouny, with the supervision of Dr. Becky Schulties, will undertake 12 months of multi-sited research in a rural hamlet and nearby town in Egypt, a country well-known for political activism and thus a particularly appropriate site for investigating these issues. The researcher will focus on infrastructure provisioning as a primary avenue through which rural areas are connected to often faraway government offices and officials. El-Kouny will use a mix of social science methods to gather data, including archival research to investigate the study hamlet's history and government interactions, such as road building projects, school construction, the coming of electricity, and improved access to water. She also will map hamlet social, kin, and mobility networks; conduct a hamlet census; and hold focus groups. In the town, she will interview key informants to learn more of the town's history. Findings from this research will improve understanding of citizenship and political activism of rural people through the lens of the mundane infrastructure through which politics is experienced in daily life. Findings will also be of interest to policy makers concerned to explain political mobilization wherever it may occur.","maroon"

Payne, Department of Geological and Environmental Sciences, Stanford University<br/>EAR-1151022<br/><br/>ABSTRACT<br/>Size and function are inseparable in biology because a wide variety of physiological and life-history traits scale with size. Patterns of size evolution can therefore complement taxonomic diversity and geochemical proxy data by providing quantitative constraints on the influence of ecological interactions and environmental change on major events in the history of life, from the origin of eukaryotes to the Cambrian explosion, the early Paleozoic radiation of marine animals, the Cenozoic rise of mammals, the circumstances of mass extinctions and subsequent recoveries, responses to climate change, and potential influences of sampling bias on taxonomic diversity. <br/>One of the most intriguing observations in the study of size evolution is that patterns of change are often shared across distantly related taxa during intervals of taxonomic radiation, mass extinction, and global environmental change. Just as comprehensive, global compilation of stratigraphic ranges has enabled vast advances in our understanding of biodiversity dynamics, an analogous compilation of body sizes spanning the Phanerozic is critical for identifying controls on the evolution of this key functional trait. <br/>The goal of this study is to determine if and when evolutionary dynamics have been shared across major clades through the Phanerozoic and thereby identify the factors that shape the evolution of organism size. To accomplish this goal, PI will compile comprehensive, genus-level size datasets for foraminifera, brachiopods, and gastropods. These groups comprise more than 25% of the genus diversity in the marine fossil record but differ in basic anatomy, physiology, and ecology. By identifying the best model for size evolution within each clade, determining whether or not the mode of size evolution has shifted during the Phanerozoic, and testing whether evolutionary dynamics are shared across these groups, PI will determine whether there are universal ecological or environmental controls on size evolution or if, instead, the dynamics of size evolution vary among groups as a function of ecological and physiological properties or change through geological time as a function of biological or environmental circumstances.<br/>This study will provide the foundation for PI's long-term education and outreach program. Participation in the collection and analysis of body size data requires relatively little technical training or access to expensive instruments or facilities. Consequently, it offers an ideal opportunity to involve students at all levels directly in data collection and analysis, both in the classroom and as part of intensive summer research programs. Each summer, six high school students and one high school teacher will assist undergraduates and the graduate student in data collection and preliminary analyses. The high school teacher will continue data collection and analysis during the academic year at Yerba Buena High School, a school that serves a majority population of economically disadvantaged families and underrepresented groups in STEM fields. The graduate student will visit the class on a biweekly basis to supervise data collection and analysis, and the class will visit Stanford each spring as a capstone experience. The PI will develop a new freshman seminar class with exercises based on data from this project. Project success will be evaluated using surveys to assess student attitudes toward STEM fields and future plans before and after participation in the project, as well as long-term tracking of students' educational histories in future years.<br/>Data collected from this project will be archived as stand-alone datasets at Dryad, but will also be entered into the Paleobiology Database, an open-access, community-wide compilation of fossil occurrence data. Size data are integral to analyses of evolutionary dynamics and the fidelity of the fossil record. Because the data produced in this study will cover a significant fraction of known marine genera, they are likely to be used broadly by the community in studies unrelated to the proposed project.","hot_pink"

Two potential mechanisms that lead to glacier acceleration and dynamic thinning are (1) increased submarine melting due to an enhanced ocean heat transport to the glacier termini, and (2) a weakening of the ice mï¿½lange that buttresses the glacier face. Fjords act as links between these two processes with the large-scale climate forcing on one hand (both oceanic and atmospheric) and the Greenland ice sheet variability on the other. However, one key process, iceberg melt, has been largely neglected in most fjord circulation studies due to a narrow focus on plume driven circulation, as well as the overall difficulty of obtaining in situ observations. This proposal aims to gather novel observations on iceberg melt and movement in Greenland?s fjords by tracking the horizontal and vertical motion of large, deep-keeled icebergs at high temporal resolution. Tracking individual icebergs, combined with ship- and drone-based surveys, will allow quantification not only of iceberg melt rates, but also of their movement through the fjord and eventual dispersal across the shelf and into the interior ocean. Fieldwork will be conducted in relatively well-studied systems in Greenland, with the potential for rapid generalization to other systems. Complemented by numerical ocean modeling, these process studies will enable assessment of how well current parameterizations capture the melt processes occurring in Greenland's waters. Ultimately, these results will provide a solid foundation for improving understanding of the spatial and temporal picture of iceberg motion and melt and how this can be incorporated into operational iceberg trajectory models, as well as global scale climate models.","plum"

Noyce funds are used to provide stipends to forty STEM professionals as they transition into teaching careers in grades 7-12 mathematics and/or science classrooms in high-needs school districts in Arizona. Through the proposed hybrid format of the SMILE program, which incorporates online courses with onsite practicum and student teaching, the number and quality of mathematics and science teachers available to high-needs school districts in Arizona is being increased. <br/><br/>The SMILE program is based on Rio Salado College's Post-Baccalaureate Teacher Preparation Program, a one-year program designed to develop and certify new teachers who have a four-year degree in a non-education field. Online courses incorporate Arizona's teacher certification requirements in curriculum that offers the knowledge and essential skills participants need to become highly effective teachers. Onsite practicum and student teaching experiences provide opportunities to observe master teachers in the classroom and practice teaching in a monitored and mentored environment. This combination of approaches provides STEM professionals flexibility in completing courses and allows the program to recruit SMILE Scholars statewide. Under the SMILE program, courses in methods and curriculum development are enhanced to incorporate mathematics and science content based on state standards. Master Teacher Seminars, designed specifically for the SMILE program, provide insight into methods, content, and resources useful in mathematics and science classrooms. SMILE Scholars receive additional development and support throughout the preparation program and while completing the required teaching commitment. SMILE Scholars are supported through professional development opportunities which integrate teaching materials, online resources, and training programs developed by three local NSF-funded centers that provide resources for STEM education. The program also incorporates post-graduation mentoring to improve the quality and retention of SMILE Scholars in the classroom. <br/><br/>Integrated course enhancements, archived Master Teacher Seminars, and professional development opportunities created through the SMILE program become part of Rio Salado College's teacher preparation program and therefore are useful to future candidates. The SMILE program offers its Scholars opportunities to receive training and experience with online teaching, thus building capacity within the teacher education program and within the workforce to meet the recent call for online high schools in each Arizona school district. In particular, the SMILE program's emphasis on mathematics and science teachers promotes the development of specific content and practicum experiences in this online teaching track to address the challenges of teaching STEM content online. <br/><br/>In addition to recruiting, developing, and supporting forty STEM professionals to become highly qualified mathematics and science teachers, the SMILE Scholars program provides an opportunity to identify factors that affect recruitment of STEM professionals into the teaching profession; identify program activities that are particularly helpful in producing competent, confident teachers; and identify conditions that promote retention of effective mathematics and science teachers in teaching careers. The SMILE dissemination plan specifically targets community colleges and alternative certification programs that have traditionally been underutilized in preparing mathematics and science teachers.","cyan"

They analyze the period between 1934 and 1947 -- a time when the U.S., having already promised independence to the Philippines, recruited Filipinos in World War II. In exchange for their service, the U.S. promised citizenship and military benefits. But in 1946 the United States revoked this promise. No other national group was denied benefits. By focusing on this puzzling period of war and decolonization, the PI's explore how the competing interests of the state manifest in policies toward Filipinos. The overarching research questions are, (1) what was the logic organizing these polices? (2) how did government officials deploy the category of ""active military service"" in revoking military benefits from Filipinos? And (3) how did they invoke the concepts of race and nation in making these decisions? <br/><br/>To answer these questions, the PI's examine historical records from the National Archives in College Park, MD and from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library in Hyde Park, NY. By collecting data from multiple institutions, the PI's explore how various state agencies, President Roosevelt, his advisors, and and Filipino elites decided to grant and revoke military benefits and citizenship to Filipino non-citizen veterans and no other national group. The PI's explore different explanations for exclusion and examine them against one another. A multi-agency analysis gives the project additional leverage for understanding the contradictory and complicated logics of exclusion within the state. The project increases our understanding in the contemporary context of what inclusion and exclusion means in a rapidly diversifying society like the United States.","crimson"

The case of emergency medical responders is intriguing and oftentimes problematic. As public service providers, they are street-level bureaucrats who work on the frontlines of the post-9/11 security state, facing political, legal and ethical collisions between the security of the communities where they live and work and their social-humanitarian responsibilities to saving lives. Professional ethics and healthcare laws require that first responders provide help without regard to the legal status of their patients, but as state actors they are also invested with political and symbolic functions of governmental authority and tightly integrated into the federal emergency preparedness and homeland security infrastructures. The study examines the relation between local governments and taxpayers that fund fire, rescue and emergency medical services, and federal and state governments, which set and implement national security, border control and immigration policies. The project will be instructive to EMS-related policy and regulatory efforts as they relate to both broader concerns about national security and public health. The project would also promote the advancement and training of students in methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, while broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. <br/><br/>Dr. Ieva Jusionyte of the University of Florida explores the everyday practices and experiences of first responders - firefighters, emergency medical technicians and paramedics - who work or volunteer for fire and rescue departments on both sides of the Arizona-Sonora border to expand our understanding of the human and social consequences of security policies and border enforcement. This project asks: (1) what effects do security policies, planned and executed at different government levels, have in the communities where they are applied? And (2) how do potential contradictions that result when these policies are put into practice impact border security efforts? Dr. Jusionyte will seek answers to these questions by engaging in a twelve-month-long ethnographic research in rural and urban communities of Southern Arizona, where she will actively collaborate with research assistants and community partners from the fire and rescue departments. The research team will conduct a series of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and archival research in order to explain how conflicting policies at different levels of governance can result in potentially deleterious consequences for people who experience them, and assess the implications that these effects have on first responders as frontline state actors. This research is an original and important contribution to our understanding of the effects of security-making and the laws, politics and ethics of rescue from an anthropological perspective.&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;","maroon"

Key questions to be addressed concern the challenges faced by scientists engaged in work on this problem, and the character of the associated shift in the norms within the scientific community. The PI will address these questions by focusing on several carefully chosen case studies of scientists and organizations at the leading edge of these transformations. The PI will use multiple methods in doing so, including in-depth, semi-structured oral history interviews with scientists, and archival research into the development of their organizations and research projects. The results of this project will be an oral history website and a monograph of case studies to document this transformative period in science.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit<br/><br/>The proposed work will contribute to the growing body of research into science and civic engagement by documenting stories of scientists themselves. In investigating how current scientific issues (such as climate change) are engendering a shift in science practice, this project will also increase our understanding of how the scientific problems of an age influence the evolution of scientific social and institutional norms, and how (in turn) those norms affect the way scientific problems are studied. The information and products gained from this research will be instructive to other scientists, to sociologists of science and to STS scholars.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts :<br/><br/>This project will serve to inform policy at academic institutions and to guide efforts to train a new generation of scientists who plan to engage in work that addresses the scientific and social complexities of climate change. Additionally, the proposed work will enhance our understanding of how to facilitate communication between scientists, policy makers, community members and other stakeholders, which could in turn improve research and policy effectiveness. The site of this work is a historically black college liberal arts college in New Orleans, and undergraduates are included in the research plan as research assistants, meaning that this project will contribute to the training of underrepresented minority students in science and social science research and encourage underrepresented minority students to pursue graduate training in those fields. The oral history website, housed at the work site, will serve to provide a deeper understanding to the New Orleans community, particularly communities of color, about the science of climate change and about science in general.","crimson"

Different parts (""articulators"") modify the airflow to create speech sounds. Since many articulators are hidden from view when the speech sounds are produced, linguists have found other devices to investigate where and how articulators operate. This is important because different sounds can be meaningful in a particular language. For example, ""p"" and ""b"" are different sounds in English since ""pit"" and ""bit"" mean different things. Instrumental tools like ultrasound and devices that measure oral-nasal airflow enable the precise articulation of speech sounds to be understood. As a result, sounds will be more accurately transcribed in language documentation and produced by learners. Sound systems are also researched by collecting and analyzing the language used in more stylized ways, like rhyme or repeated consonant sounds (""alliteration"") in different genres. Understanding the sound system of a language is critical for compiling dictionaries, developing a systematic orthographic system and language teaching materials. This project will document the speech sounds of a highly endangered language that has an unusually large number of sounds that are formed by curling the tip of the tongue up towards the hard palate (""retroflex""). Broader impacts include the production of linguistic and cultural materials for direct use by the endangered language community, the training of a post-doctoral researcher and undergraduate students, and a new international collaboration with a local university and an NGO. USAID researchers working on education and literacy projects in the region will also benefit from the products of this project.

Kalasha is of linguistic importance in part due to its many retroflexed sounds, since the wide range of these and other speech sounds are found in less than 1% of the world's languages. The project will document the phonetics and phonology of Kalasha through instrumental techniques like lingual ultrasound, and will use best practices in language documentation to compile an online dictionary and to transcribe oral literature (songs, short stories, narratives, poems). The researchers will also develop flexible speech analysis tools, and make data and findings available through existing cross-linguistic databases and archives. Lingual ultrasound and oral-nasal airflow are ideal methods for describing the retroflex consonants, and nasal and retroflex vowels of Kalasha. The instrumental phonetic investigation will enable a better understanding of these uncommon speech sounds and will generate an audio-video ultrasound corpus. The audio-video corpus and other spontaneous speech data will be used to revise the orthography of Kalasha and to develop pedagogical materials for the community.","maroon"

Many scholars of human rights have traditionally used the phrase human rights regime to refer to a set of norms and procedures that have been formalized and codified in international law. But the codification of universal human rights has been far more contested in local contexts, where concepts of rights are contingent upon widely ranging historical, cultural, and political economic experiences. This project explores how different notions of human rights have emerged and have been debated, often in ways that might seem paradoxical or counterintuitive. Immigration policy and diplomatic practice could benefit from the improved understanding of these contexts that this project will afford. This project would also broaden the participation of a historically underrepresented group in the sciences. <br/><br/>Dr. Marvin Sterling of Indiana University will explore the factors that influence the discourse and practice of human rights. With focus on the Jamaican case, the investigator frames the study as a first systematic effort to identify specific commonalities in the postcolonial experience, particularly in the Commonwealth of Nations, that shape or have resulted from human rights debates in these societies. The project also aims to understand how locally contextual interpretations of rights have been formed through transnational engagements. Methods of data collection during this six-month project include gathering archival data with the aim of historicizing discourses of human rights, interviewing the members and observing the activities of local human rights groups, and a content analysis of national and international media. The project would contribute to advancing anthropological theories of human rights, particularly within the subfields of legal and political anthropology. Specifically, the project explores the regime of human rights as something constituted by historically, economically, and culturally specific notions of citizenship, freedom, and autonomy.","maroon"

Their shells are composed of calcium carbonate and the oxygen isotopic composition of their shells record climatic conditions during growth. Therefore, the oxygen isotopic composition of land snails has the potential to reconstruct past climates on broad spatial and temporal scales. To date, however, there is a little understanding on the kinds of climatic information that can be inferred from the snails, and therefore, their current use as paleoclimatic archives is limited. This proposal will develop, test, and calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of small land snails for use as a paleoclimatic proxy in terrestrial settings across North America. The modern calibration of this proxy will benefit society through the development of a terrestrial paleoclimatic proxy that is capable of reconstructing past climate over broad spatial and temporal scales and also will improve our understanding of the taxonomic diversity and spatial distribution of land snails, a fauna that is decreasing at an alarming rate globally. This project will teach and train future scientists, from high school to PhD candidates, integrate scientists from multiple fields (paleontology, biology, Quaternary geology), and broaden the participation of diverse and underrepresented groups. Dissemination of results will include a diverse audience (specialists and general public), in English and Spanish to reach the Hispanic community in USA and elsewhere. This project will establish linkages between underrepresented groups and STEM disciplines at research-intensive universities. <br/><br/>To calibrate the oxygen isotope systematics of modern land snails in North America, investigators will analyze the oxygen isotope composition of approximately 1,000 shell samples from modern snails collected along two selected transects that cross North America from southern Texas to Canada. They will identify the primary climatic controls on shell ï¿½18O values by quantifying the relation between shell ï¿½18O and relevant climatic variables (temperature, ï¿½18O of precipitation, precipitation amount, relative humidity) using an evaporative steady-state flux balance-mixing model developed for land snails. Researchers hypothesize that: (1) the oxygen isotope composition of small land snails in temperate environments (latitudes of 26 to 48 degrees N) primarily will reflect the oxygen isotope composition of precipitation, and therefore can be used to infer past changes in precipitation oxygen isotope values; and (2) shell oxygen isotope values of snails living in arid to semi-arid environments will yield higher values than predicted because of low relative humidity values. After calibration of the oxygen isotope systematics for living specimens, investigators will conduct two case studies to determine how well the oxygen isotope values of small snails track the oxygen isotope records of speleothems or other proxy records. The proposed work will allow better quantification of past climate change over broad areas of North America, and from many different types of deposits.","hot_pink"

Timothy Rowe (University of Texas), Grant Meyer (UNM), and Leslie McFadden (UNM), will undertake research to investigate the exploitation of now-extinct elephants (mammoths, mastodons, and gomphotheres) by latest Pleistocene North American hunters of the Clovis cultural complex. The research documents a significant part of the American cultural heritage and to preserve artifacts associated with it. Despite the passage of some 80 years since discovery of the first Clovis-elephant association, disagreement remains about the significance of these large mammals in the Clovis diet. Some scholars believe that they were critical dietary resources killed whenever encountered, while others suggest that they were rarely taken and ranked much lower in the diet than small- and medium-sized game. Researchers who favor the latter perspective argue that elephant hunting only makes energetic sense if killed animals are thoroughly butchered; however, others propose that situational factors such as the size of the elephant, its nutritional condition, and the size of human social group will frequently dictate a less-than-thorough butchering. Archaeological evidence at previously excavated Clovis sites has suggested that many elephants were ""lightly used."" The disagreements are fueled in part by the small number (15) of known Clovis-elephant sites, and in part by divergent theoretical views on recent and past hunter-gatherer use of elephants. <br/><br/>Dr. Huckell and his collaborators will undertake high-risk research to test the hypothesis that Clovis hunters did not thoroughly butcher the elephants they killed, and that they were sensitive to diminishing energetic returns of meat with continued butchering labor. Optimal foraging theory - and specifically the diet breadth and patch choice (prey-as-patch) models - underpin the research. The scientific merits of this project are two-fold. First will be excavation of the newly discovered Hartley Mammoth in northern New Mexico, which contains the bones of a single mammoth rapidly being exposed by erosion, and nearby on the surface, a Clovis point. Excavation - including paleoenvironmental studies - of the areas containing the bones and the nearby point will determine whether Clovis foragers killed this mammoth, and if so, how intensively they butchered it. The second aspect of scientific merit is that investigation of the Hartley Mammoth provides a point of departure to review the extent of Clovis butchering of mammoth and other elephant carcasses at 10 previously excavated sites. Archival records for spatially discrete, single elephant carcasses will be examined for patterning among the carcasses. Maps of each carcass will be digitized, bones will be identified to element, portion, and side, and the position of the animal in death, its age, and size will be determined. The positions, types, and numbers of associated lithic or other artifacts will be tallied. Broader impacts of this research will include educational and training benefits for the graduate student crew, and use of the site for master's degree research by a young woman. The project will publicize Gary Hartley's decision to share his discovery with scientists, which may encourage others to do the same in the future, thereby contributing to the enhancement of knowledge of the nation's history of human occupation.","maroon"

The practice of diplomacy has changed dramatically in recent decades as a result of technological advancements and shifting geopolitical concerns. Individuals around the world now have the opportunity to communicate directly with ambassadors and foreign ministers on Twitter, disclosure of diplomatic correspondences on WikiLeaks have heightened calls for more transparency in diplomatic exchanges, and non-state terrorist actors continue to challenge the idea that diplomats and their facilities are inviolable. While some countries have adjusted to 21st century realities by adapting to a more mobile, maneuverable diplomatic corps and fewer diplomatic facilities, the United States remains committed to a widespread diplomatic network. This diplomatic footprint is the hallmark of universality, a sustained effort beginning in the second half of the 20th century to acquire nearly total diplomatic coverage by scattering around the world embassies and consulates designed to look, work, and behave in a similar manner regardless of their geographic location. Attending to this understudied phenomenon means studying the historical and geographic conditions out of which the United States? relatively even and uniform diplomatic apparatus materialized. By examining the relationship between diplomatic infrastructure and foreign policy aims, this project will apply geographic approaches focusing on everyday materialisms and institutional networks to examine diplomatic practice and the implications of those practices. The project will expand current approaches to diplomatic theory and practice, bringing examinations of everyday practice back into a central role in diplomatic studies. Project findings will facilitate self-evaluation by the U.S. Department of State of the implications of its diplomatic geography, and it will assist others engaged in diplomatic practice in assessing the geographic implications of practices on statecraft. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The doctoral student will focus the project on the following sets of questions: (1) What factors influence decision making related to U.S. embassy and consulate placement? (2) How does the U.S. approach to diplomatic infrastructure differ from that of other states? (3) In what ways does the universal character of each facility prove alternately productive and counterproductive for U.S. foreign policy aims? The student will employ methods that draw on institutional ethnographic techniques at multiple scales and a wide range of voices, including ground practitioners, high-level policymakers, retired ambassadors, voices from the past, and the student's own experience in Washington, D.C., and within the U.S. Department of State. She will identify the origins of the universality argument and its continued relevance alongside 21st century diplomatic practices. She also will engage in archival research and conduct interviews with current and former members of the diplomatic corps.","maroon"

The expansion of plantation agriculture and such massive labor migrations were critical to the development of global economic networks, while on the local level labor diasporas resulted in the emergence of new creolized cultures. Since major movements of people across the globe for economic reasons continue today understanding long term processes involved is of contemporary relevance. This comparative study contextualizes slave and post-slave experiences within an indentured labor regime that overlapped and replaced it. Archaeology's material and spatial nature is well suited to investigate both the daily practices and experiences of laborers, as well as the larger regional networks of which plantations were a part. This project will extend the scope of current research on and among migrant and diaspora populations, considering how choice in migration and perceptions of one's mobility influence ongoing identity practices. Engaging with transnational studies will provide a new model for archaeologists examining such populations, contribute to our understanding of the historical and material implications of labor migrations, and illuminate where and how global capitalism developed in the Indian Ocean region. This research will take place in Bras d'Eau National Park, an 18th-19th-century sugar plantation on the island of Mauritius. As part of the first large-scale investigation into an Indian Ocean plantation site, this project will add tangible heritage value to the Bras d'Eau National Park, and introduce archaeology to the Mauritian public. Mauritian students studying history and heritage and park personnel will participate in fieldwork and artifact analysis as a means to build local infrastructure and knowledge. Such exposure will increase public scientific literacy and engagement by educating about the archaeological process, and the potential of archaeological sites on Mauritius to shed light on hidden aspects of the island's past.<br/><br/>Julia Jong Haines, under supervision of Dr. Adria LaViolette, University of Virginia, will investigate how enslaved and indentured laborers' materials and spaces reflect different social organizations and practices and how they changed over time. Were the daily lives of enslaved (mostly SE African) and indentured (mostly South Asian) laborers markedly different? What difference did laborers' homelands make in diaspora cultural practices? How were laborers engaged in local and global trade and exchange networks, and did they maintain ties to their homelands? Data and materials collected through archaeological survey, excavations, and documentary archival and oral historical research will be used to compare laborers' daily life consumption patterns that indicate foodways, personal and religious practices, domestic architecture and spatial arrangements, and participation in domestic and international economies. Engaging with both well-established creolization models and recent transnational labor migration studies, this study will determine to what degree different laborers practiced creolized identities and maintained ties to homelands while also creating new creolized practices. Untangling the complexities of creation and expression in daily life among Bras d'Eau's diverse population, this project will contribute to Mauritian heritage, and comparative archaeologies of diaspora contexts.","maroon"

The proposed research is a multi-scale investigation aimed at connecting deformation processes, tectonics, and orogenic evolution using a state of the art, self consistent Multi-Order Power-Law Approach (MOPLA) which incorporates multi-scale deformation in its formulation and provides a rigorous means for bridging small-scale studies to tectonic-scale deformation conditions and processes. The relationship of tectonics to orogenic evolution and the resulting multi-scale deformation will be investigated by applying MOPLA to the data rich central Sierra Nevada where extensive multi-scale structural, strain, and petrological data linked to mapping and geochronology have been collected over several decades. These define an apparent Mesozoic history of episodic deformation, plate motions, and tectonic regimes that parallel episodic magmatism. A geographic information system (GIS)-based synthesis of new and existing datasets will be created and then integrated with MOPLA to construct and test multi-scale modeling predictions. This work will test the hypothesis that intra-orogenic deformation is partly controlled by evolving deformation partitioning that is further modulated by the thermal effects and volume addition related to episodic magmatism. This will be investigated through modeling to test four corollary, interrelated hypotheses: (1) Structural variations observed in the central Sierra Nevada at all scales often arise from time-dependent deformation partitioning rather than shifting plate motions. (2) Magmatic fabric orientations in central Sierra Nevada plutons represent local fabrics developed in partitioned flow fields rather than distinct increments of the bulk deformation field. (3) Episodic deformation is primarily driven by the effects of episodic magmatism. (4) Intra-orogenic bulk shortening is accommodated primarily by crustal thickening along broad, low strain domains rather than motion along localized, high strain zones. As single scale structural studies and plate motion reconstructions for older orogens are limited, forward modeling of multi-scale deformation will lead to a better understanding of how to integrate local observations to explore their regional significance.","hot_pink"

In many areas, the deep portion of the fault that lies at the transition between the fast and slower slip mechanisms is out of view, sitting offshore, away from nearby monitoring. However, an existing seismic and geodetic network along the Oaxacan segment of the Middle America subduction zone provides an excellent dataset for use to quantify earthquake occurrence and source parameters in an area that has experienced M > 7 earthquakes, tremor, and slow slip events. <br/><br/>This research will address several hypotheses related to the spatial and temporal relationships between slow slip, tremor, and large earthquakes. These include determining 1) if a sharp transition in seismicity characteristics exists along the megathrust as events approach the downdip seismicity limit and the area of episodic tremor and slip, 2) if slow slip events produce stress loading in adjacent regions that lead to increased seismicity rates and changes in source characteristics of small earthquakes, and 3) if large earthquakes are associated with temporal changes in earthquake occurrence and source characteristics in adjacent regions due to stress changes. We will employ several seismological techniques, including the construction of a uniform event catalog, focal mechanism determination, rupture duration and stress drop calculations, and investigation of seismicity rates along specific fault patches, to address these hypotheses.<br/><br/>The overall goals of the project revolve around a better understanding of the deep roots of the earthquake-producing region of the Mexican subduction zone, with applicability to other global subduction zones.

The geochemical analysis of sediment and rock cores, from land and sea, is a critical component of research studying past and present climate change, Earth's tectonic history, and anthropogenic disturbance of our environment. In climate research especially, high-resolution geochemical and mineralogical proxy-data is needed to model and understanding mechanisms of climate change on time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. The three most important broader impacts of this proposal are a) the establishment of a regional analytical facility that will serve scientists and students within a three hour radius of New York; b) the provision of enhanced and needed analytical capability to numerous pre-tenure faculty and scientists at Columbia University; and c) the acquisition of an instrument that will provide graduate student training central to their professional life and chosen fields. In addition, the XRF facility will enhance the educational and research experience of the many students and laypeople that come to visit and/or work in the Repository. The number of visitors to the Lamont-Doherty Core Repository has increased dramatically over the last four years as the Repository has evolved into an educational and outreach center for colleagues, local colleges, high schools, local intern programs, ELHI teachers and their local professional organizations, workshop/conference attendees, and journalists, among others. The goal of the Repository has been to create an environment that lends itself to educating students and adults at all educational levels while simultaneously inspiring curiosity and wonder. Particular effort has been put into to ensuring that visitors understand (in an age-appropriate way) the link between the science carried out every day in the Repository and the larger, issues of evolution, natural resource availability, and climate change that all citizens should understand. <br/><br/>XRF data are used to study topics as diverse as terrestrial drought and precipitation history, glacier history, groundwater health issues, CO2 sequestration, and fisheries and resource pollution issues. Numerous scientific projects based at Lamont, funded by programs spanning the breadth of the Geosciences Directorate, will benefit from the acquisition of the XRF core scanner. In addition, numerous scientists within the northeast corridor will also benefit from the expansion of Lamont's analytical facilities. Many scientists who run NSF-funded coring expeditions, on land or sea, recognize the benefits of sampling and archiving their cores at the Lamont-Doherty Core Repository, especially if their cores require cold storage. An XRF core scanner at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will meet the objective of enhancing the analytical services offered to internal and external investigators, as well as making it much easier for students in the region to be active participants in the research they are undertaking with their advisors.","lavender"

Opening of the channels and the resulting flow of K+ through the membrane is induced by a change in membrane voltage or by interaction with ligands. Because potassium channels are of such importance for normal physiological function, many organisms have evolved toxins that target channels, and these toxins have been used as important tools in the study of channel function and structure. Preliminary studies identified a toxin (Tx7335) from the eastern green mamba snake (Dendroaspis angusticeps) that increases frequency and duration of channel openings in the bacterial potassium channel KcsA. This is a very unusual function for a toxin that interacts directly with the potassium-conducting domain of the channel, as most such toxins act as blockers of K+ currents. The functional effect of Tx7335 therefore represents a new mechanism of K+-channel regulation. The main research objective of this project is to understand the basis for the functional effect of Tx7335, and in particular the details of the interaction between channel and toxin and the structural changes that toxin binding induces in the channel. In order to probe the surface of the channel that interacts with the toxin, individual amino acid residues on the external surface of KcsA that may interact with the toxin will be mutated to a different amino acid. If the original amino acid is indeed important in the interaction, then the expectation is that the mutation will lead to a different response of the mutant channel to the toxin. The response will be tested by measuring potassium currents flowing through all mutant channels in artificial bilayers with and without added toxin. A rough mapping of the toxin binding site will be possible in this way. Mutations will also be made on the toxin to identify residues on the surface of the toxin that interact with the channel. Solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) experiments will be used to obtain higher-resolution structural information of the channel-toxin interactions. This technique allows the characterization of the binding interface and the detection of structural changes upon toxin binding to be performed with atomic resolution. These experiments will eventually allow resolving the three-dimensional toxin-channel complex structure. This knowledge will advance understanding of K+ channel function and regulation, with relevance for a large number of biological processes in animals that are dependent on influx of potassium ions. In addition, this understanding will also be relevant to plant physiology, where highly homologous potassium channels are involved in potassium uptake and transport as well as in the opening and closing of stomata by regulating the turgor pressure of the surrounding guard cells. Lastly, ion channel toxins selective for insect channels may also be very useful as insecticides with reduced negative environmental impact, and better understanding of toxin-channel interactions will be beneficial in guiding the development of such pest control approaches in agriculture.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/> The project will provide an opportunity for the integration of research in education and will contribute to the training of the next generation of students in Staten Island and the greater New York City area with a special emphasis on students who are historically underrepresented in science. Undergraduate and high-school students participants will be recruited from the College of Staten Island, from LaGuardia Community College (a minority-serving institution), and from high-need local Staten Island high schools. Students will be closely mentored to promote development of their scientific and critical thinking skills and to increase their preparation to succeed in science. An outreach program through the Discovery Institute at the College of Staten Island will involve developing and disseminating teaching modules based on the proposed research suitable for implementation at the high-school level. These programs will be created by interested teachers in collaboration with the PI and Discovery Institute experts, and will be based on analysis of structural data pertaining to the project using molecular visualization software. Students will suggest mutations that would affect toxin binding and upload these to the project web site. Submissions will be functionally tested by the research staff and the final experiments will be streamed back to the high school and archived as video podcasts on the project server. The implementation of these modules will help to create excitement for science and engage students in hypothesis-driven research through media that the students are already familiar with (computer 3D software, webcasts and online video). Lastly, the curriculum for the undergraduate biochemistry laboratory course that the PI teaches at the College of Staten Island will also be redesigned as a research-based course drawing from elements of the research project. This exposure to actual research in a mandatory lab course will enrich student's understanding of the nature of science and the design of research. In summary, the research will serve as a vehicle to increase scientific interest, literacy and fluency among involved undergraduate students as well as local high-school teachers and students.","medium_blue"

This three-year project is based on a core activity, the recording (audio and video) and processing of a target of 54 hours of natural speech by fluent native speaker Potawatomi elders. This activity will both lead to and be complemented by a set of related projects, including the elaboration of our dictionary database, creation of a coordinated set of tools for language analysis, and the expansion of a partial grammatical sketch of the language created by co-PI Welcher in 1998.<br/><br/>Potawatomi (or Bodï¿½wadmimwen) is a critically endangered language spoken primarily in the Midwestern United States (Wisconsin, Michigan, Kansas, and Oklahoma). The dialect being documented here is Forest County Potawatomi, spoken in Wisconsin. Of the total 10-15 remaining fluent elder speakers of Potawatomi, nine live in Wisconsin, so this is the ideal place for such a project. Documentation which exists on the language is limited in quantity and scope, making further documentation all the more urgent.<br/><br/>Existing records of unscripted connected speech include a small number of handwritten, partially translated narratives collected by Charles Hockett, scattered pedagogical materials whose spontaneity varies widely, and scattered recordings by community language activists. The addition of genres such as conversations, oral histories, and other types of discourse will round out our record of Potawatomi language use. Potawatomi narrative texts are significantly different from everyday discourse, even in terms of grammatical structure, and thus creation of a record of such texts will broaden the empirical basis upon which linguistic analyses can be performed. Systematic transcription, analysis, and archiving of collected recordings in consultation with fluent speakers will result in a primary language resource that will be of immense benefit to researchers, as well as to language teachers and learners.<br/><br/>The project is the continuation of a collaboration between native speakers, community language activists, linguists, and a software applications expert, all currently working on a dictionary of Potawatomi, and it will result in additional materials useful to all of these constituencies. Because of the level of community involvement in the entire process we have a clear focus on producing a product that will be of immediate benefit to community-driven language revitalization. In addition, we will be working in parallel with a new Forest County Potawatomi community-based language documentation project inspired by and continuing our dictionary project.","maroon"

The problem is particularly urgent in developing countries heavily reliant on agriculture, which can account for as much as 85-90% of fresh water usage. Effective water resource management has significant implications for food security, health, and worldwide political stability. This is increasingly important in the face of a growing population, dramatic shifts in land use, and changing climatic conditions. Historically, the world?s farmers have relied on traditional practices to manage water, but now find themselves challenged by new conditions that require adaptation to these farming practices. Understanding the complex array of factors?psychological, social, environmental, and political?that facilitate and constrain effective adaptation requires an integrated research agenda that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. This research draws upon the core disciplines of psychology, sociology, hydrology, and engineering in order to investigate these issues among paddy farmers within the Mahaweli River Watershed, Sri Lanka?a largely agricultural region that is a microcosm of the sort of massive changes occurring throughout the world in environmental, institutional, and social systems. These changes include impacts of drought as well as an ongoing national resettlement plan to populate and develop regions of the watershed. The research team will use a multi-level, multi-method approach that incorporates longitudinal farmer surveys, regional level drought indices (coupled with short- and long-term drought forecast methods), key informant interviews, and archival analysis. The research team will investigate how farmers adapt to changing water availability and how these decisions are affected by psychological, social, institutional, and environmental factors. The team will examine water availability and rice yields in light of farmers? adaptive actions, changing rainfall and temperature patterns, land use changes, and water allocation decisions. These multiple streams of data will be integrated using agent-based modeling to generate a rich set of future scenarios to characterize how changes to social and institutional circumstances and in the natural environment may affect farmers' adaptive actions and their effectiveness in managing vulnerability to water scarcity.<br/><br/> This project will not only advance our theoretical knowledge within and across disciplines; it will provide much needed practical information about sustainable water resource management to farmers and decision makers in a developing country where water scarcities have major implications for food security. A recent report from the U.S. National Intelligence Agency looking forward to the year 2040 concludes: ?Water problems will hinder the ability of key countries to produce food and generate energy, posing a risk to global food markets and hobbling economic growth.? This research is directed towards averting the worst of such consequences by furthering the knowledge of farmers, local community leaders, national governmental leaders, and researchers about strategies to reduce water stresses and facilitate adaptation. Additionally, the team has incorporated a major educational aspect in the project to train the next generation of scholars in a thoroughly interdisciplinary framework. As such, they will be mentored not only in theory and methodology but also in how to communicate research to diverse audiences, including policymakers and some of the world?s most vulnerable populations.","hot_pink"

Most programmers work on projects they did not start. Most companies spend more on maintaining old systems than on building new ones. This is good, because it shows that companies build software that is worth keeping and maintaining, but it also means that change is the heart of software development. Most programming tools treat change at a very low level: programmers make most changes with text editors, and tools tend to focus on changes to lines of text, and although programming is predominantly about change, contemporary tools do not provide direct support for understanding or facilitating change. This makes programming more expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone than it should be. This research project will develop a change-oriented programming environment (COPE) that supports change by putting transformations at the center of software development. COPE will enable both average and expert programmers to write, script, modify, and replay their own transformations. COPE will enable programmers to think about programs as compositions of transformations, and to automate as many of these transformations as possible. Characterizing software development in terms of transformations is an essential step to take software engineering from manual development to automated (or semi-automated) development of software.<br/><br/>By enabling programmers to express their programming tasks as program transformations, COPE will This alter the way programmers think about, teach, create, reuse, and understand programs. Specifically, COPE considers five activities: (1) analyze what changes programmers typically make and how they perceive, recall, and communicate changes, (2) automate transformations to make it easier to apply and script changes, (3) develop tools that compose and manipulate transformations to make it easier to reuse them, (4) integrate transformations with version control to provide better ways for archiving and understanding changes, and (5) develop tools that infer higher-level transformations from lower-level changes. COPE will deliver a rich transformation-aware toolset that synergistically integrates all these activities. COPE aims to (a) change the way people program, (b) create a platform for research for future research, and (c) produce results that ultimately will become standard software development practice. The PIs will disseminate the results through presentations, books, publications, open-source code, industrial collaborations, and educational activities. A version of COPE will be used to revamp the software engineering curriculum at the University of Illinois and the University of Texas to emphasize the science of change in large code bases.","ivory"

One of the richest archives of the biotic and environmental changes on land for this period is on the Colorado Plateau, which despite over 100 years of study still remains poorly calibrated in time and poorly registered to the rest of the global record. To provide this desiderata, we will drill a continuous a ~500 m core through nearly the entire Triassic age section (Chinle and Moenkopi formations) at Petrified Forest National Park (PFNP), Arizona, USA, one of the most famous and best studied successions of the continental Triassic on Earth. A continuous sampling (core) is needed to place this spectacular record in a reliable quantitative and exportable time scale, which has proved impractical in outcrop. The Petrified Forest core will provide a quantitatively sound reference section in which magnetostratigraphic, geochronologic, environmental, and paleontologic data are registered to a common thickness scale with unambiguous superposition and will provide pristine unweathered samples. With such a reference section in hand the entire voluminous assemblage of outcrop data from the PFNP and the surrounding region can be integrated into the global framework. The hole will be deviated 30ï¿½ from vertical to provide core-bedding orientation intersections for an azimuthal guide; additionally, the orientation of the core will be registered to the hole wall using whole-core-scans and compass-oriented acoustic and optical televiewer images and dipmeter surveys. Core orientation will facilitate the recovery of a high-resolution magnetic polarity stratigraphy for correlation to the fossil-rich outcrop sections. The polarity sequence will be calibrated by a series of high-precision U-Pb zircon dates obtained from discrete levels in the core, and will provide critical data to fill the geochronologic gap in global terrestrial and marine time scales for the Late Triassic. The age-calibrated chronostratigraphy of the PFNP core will be used to address major issues of early Mesozoic biotic and environmental change. These include whether marine and continental biotic turnover events in the Late Triassic were coupled; was the largest magnitude faunal turnover event on land during the Late Triassic synchronous with the giant Manicouagan impact; Is the NSF-funded Newark basin astronomically-calibrated time scale consistent with high precision U-Pb zircon age data from the Chinle Formation; and was the cyclical climate change recorded in the Newark basin lacustrine record paced by Milankovitch climate change? <br/> In addition to the science generated by the core and its integration into the local and global environmental and biotic framework, the project will have a major education and outreach component. The Petrified Forest National Park is a major tourist destination, averaging 600,000 visitors a year. We plan to leverage this huge resource by developing a permanent exhibit on the coring project and its important scientific results for the park. We will involve numerous student groups during the actual coring activities, including Native American geoscience concentrators at The University of New Mexico/Gallup and K-12 students from throughout the Gallup area. In addition, we will sponsor several workshops at the Park and will reach out to the general public for their participation. The project involves six co-PIs from different institutions and will last 24 months and is intended to provide an initial synopsis of basic stratigraphic, logging, magnetic polarity, and geochronologic data for utilization by the international scientific community for further research and integration with other studies, as well as a major platform for outreach, and a better understanding of how the modern world came to be.","hot_pink"

The project will provide the first in-situ global neutral density data in more than 25 years, including the first direct measurements of Hydrogen densities using the mass spectrometer technique. An important science objective for EXOCUBE is to provide observational constraints for physical models of the upper atmosphere. Additionally, the measurements will be used to test and validate newly developed experimental techniques to obtain neutral and ionized composition and densities from radar and optical observations. The EXOCUBE measurements will also be used for several immediate science investigations. Specific science questions to be addressed include: 1) the inter-hemispheric transport of Hydrogen and protons in the quiescent and storm-time exosphere, and 2) characterization of neutral atmospheric drivers in response to magnetic storms. Data for each of four neutral and ion species (O, He, H, N2, O+, He+, H+, and NO+) are gathered by a set of two Static Energy Angle Analyzers, one for Neutrals (NSEAA) and one for Ions (ISEAA), respectively. The instrument is a new design that has been developed recently through a collaboration between NASA and the Naval Research Laboratory. A third instrument, a Faraday cup, is included for calibration, reducing ion density uncertainties to approximately plus or minus 3%. The satellite will collect data in two modes. In 'patrol mode' the measurements will be made approximately every degree of longitude and in 'coordinated experimental mode' the measurements will be made every tenth of a longitude degree in conjunction with ground based radar and optical measurements. The satellite is to be launched into low Earth orbit with an inclination of greater than or equal to 45 degrees, passing over three current radar sites, and at least six optical Aeronomy sites. <br/><br/>The EXOCUBE project is a collaboration between Scientific Solutions Inc. (SSI), California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), and The University of Wisconsin (UW). Also partnering in the effort are NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and SRI International. In addition, the project coordinates with existing NSF radar facilities and optical sites for targeted experiments during the satellite lifetime. The EXOCUBE dataset has broad utility, leading to long-awaited improvements in a wide range of physical and semi-empirical composition models for the upper atmosphere and to verification of radar and optical measurement techniques providing composition data. As such, the project will provide the foundation for a very large and diverse set of further aeronomy and space weather science investigations. Particularly, reliable knowledge of exospheric Hydrogen distribution is a crucial requirement for realistically modeling Total Electron Content, which is currently a very high priority space weather objective. Educational impacts of the project are extraordinary. The satellite bus and operating systems are designed and built by 20-40 students in the laboratories at Cal Poly, and payload integration is also performed by students at Cal Poly. Students at the University of Wisconsin are involved with instrument calibration and testing and with initial assessment of data integrity.

This transformation has resulted from the interrelated national security concerns of the Mexican and U.S. governments regarding immigration, drug trafficking, and the growth of criminal organizations. Both the Mexican and U.S. governments have chosen to address these concerns through ""militarization"" -- the inclusion of military ideology, tactics, technologies, and force in domestic governance and policing. This research project will investigate how militarized approaches to border governance and territorial control reconfigure everyday life for residents of the borderland. The investigators' objectives are to study how border militarization alters the form, function, and meaning of the U.S.-Mexico borderlands for resident communities and to examine how militarization is shaped by border landscapes on both sides of the divide. Special attention will be given to militarization of the borderlands as expressed and evident in the region's landscape as well as how federal militarization as a governance strategy affects the everyday experience of mobility, rights, belonging, and environment among diverse border populations. A multidisciplinary team with scholars from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada will conduct this study in two binational border metropolises of El Paso, Texas-Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Nogales, Arizona-Nogales, Sonora. As strategic points in federal militarization strategies, these cities regularly experience an increased presence of law enforcement as well as intensifying surveillance, interrogation, and searches. They also share some of the longest histories of joint families, communities, and economies along the border. The investigators will engage in archival research, open-ended interviews, and focus groups, all of which will be designed to investigate the multiple intersections of militarization and landscape and to mine the complexity of these intersections within daily life.<br/><br/>The project will enhance basic knowledge about the processes of border militarization, its impacts on residents, and its interaction with landscape. In addition to enhancing fundamental understanding, it will provide information and insights for the architects and implementers of militarization strategies who seek to rectify problems created in earlier manifestations. It also will benefit citizens' organizations, environmental organizations, and social justice groups as they react to current policies and try to shape future ones. Results will be disseminated in both English and in Spanish in academic and policy-oriented journals and will be presented at appropriate international and regional conferences.","maroon"

The project will provide the first in-situ global neutral density data in more than 25 years, including the first direct measurements of Hydrogen densities using the mass spectrometer technique. An important science objective for EXOCUBE is to provide observational constraints for physical models of the upper atmosphere. Additionally, the measurements will be used to test and validate newly developed experimental techniques to obtain neutral and ionized composition and densities from radar and optical observations. The EXOCUBE measurements will also be used for several immediate science investigations. Specific science questions to be addressed include: 1) the inter-hemispheric transport of Hydrogen and protons in the quiescent and storm-time exosphere, and 2) characterization of neutral atmospheric drivers in response to magnetic storms. Data for each of four neutral and ion species (O, He, H, N2, O+, He+, H+, and NO+) are gathered by a set of two Static Energy Angle Analyzers, one for Neutrals (NSEAA) and one for Ions (ISEAA), respectively. The instrument is a new design that has been developed recently through a collaboration between NASA and the Naval Research Laboratory. A third instrument, a Faraday cup, is included for calibration, reducing ion density uncertainties to approximately plus or minus 3%. The satellite will collect data in two modes. In 'patrol mode' the measurements will be made approximately every degree of longitude and in 'coordinated experimental mode' the measurements will be made every tenth of a longitude degree in conjunction with ground based radar and optical measurements. The satellite is to be launched into low Earth orbit with an inclination of greater than or equal to 45 degrees, passing over three current radar sites, and at least six optical Aeronomy sites. <br/><br/>The EXOCUBE project is a collaboration between Scientific Solutions Inc. (SSI), California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly), and The University of Wisconsin (UW). Also partnering in the effort are NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and SRI International. In addition, the project coordinates with existing NSF radar facilities and optical sites for targeted experiments during the satellite lifetime. The EXOCUBE dataset has broad utility, leading to long-awaited improvements in a wide range of physical and semi-empirical composition models for the upper atmosphere and to verification of radar and optical measurement techniques providing composition data. As such, the project will provide the foundation for a very large and diverse set of further aeronomy and space weather science investigations. Particularly, reliable knowledge of exospheric Hydrogen distribution is a crucial requirement for realistically modeling Total Electron Content, which is currently a very high priority space weather objective. Educational impacts of the project are extraordinary. The satellite bus and operating systems are designed and built by 20-40 students in the laboratories at Cal Poly, and payload integration is also performed by students at Cal Poly. Students at the University of Wisconsin are involved with instrument calibration and testing and with initial assessment of data integrity. Data formatting and archiving are also student led.","fuchsia"

Giovannoni (USDA-ARS/Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research)<br/><br/>Fleshy fruit are unique plant developmental systems and provide important components of human and animal diets. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), an economically important crop, has emerged as the principal model for studies of fleshy fruit development, ripening, shelf life and nutritional quality. However, many fundamental questions related to key aspects of the development, physiology, quality traits and environmental responses of fleshy fruit remain unanswered. This project will decipher complex problems in plant biology that are also central to fleshy fruit development and quality: (i) the regulatory processes that influence fruit growth and ripening; (ii) the associated hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways; and (iii) molecular events that result in cell wall formation and restructuring, and that provide protection from environmental stresses. An important element of this project is the development of a strong education and training component. This will take the form of two programs: (1) an annual Plant Genomics and Systems Biology Workshop, comprising a series of integrated 'technology modules' with both seminars and lab-based practical training in 'omics disciplines'; (2) a multi-level training course in Scientific Communication, providing guidance in both oral and written presentation skills. These will be affiliated with undergraduate students, high school students and high school teachers, with particular emphasis on the participation of under-represented groups through the support of a network of existing Cornell programs. <br/><br/>Studies to date have provided valuable initial insights into the identity and temporal expression patterns of some of the genes that regulate fruit development; however, they have almost exclusively used total tomato fruit pericarp ('flesh') and have largely ignored spatial variation in global gene expression in the different constituent cell types. The goal of this project is to extend these studies to characterize the responses of fruits to drought, an increasing problem in crop production, in tomato using cutting edge genomics technologies. These studies will be extended to two diverse wild relatives of tomato that show a high tolerance of water stress, and so may provide opportunities for crop improvement. The expected outcomes are: A) the Tomato Expression Atlas (TEA), a gene expression database for cultivated tomato and wild relatives, and new insights into the regulatory circuitry that controls fruit development and responses to drought, at a cell/tissue type level of resolution; B) detailed information about the tissue specificity of hormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways, and cell wall biosynthesis and remodeling during fruit development in tomato and wild relatives, and following drought treatments. Public access to all data and biological materials will be through the Tomato Expression Atlas (TEA) website and long-term public repositories. All DNA sequences will be released to the public domain immediately after generation and quality control through Genbank (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and SGN (http://solgenomics.net). Raw RNA-Seq, sRNA-seq and BS-seq datasets generated under this project will be submitted to NCBI SRA (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) for long term storage and public access while processed expression and methylation profiles will be archived and accessed through the TEA and through the Tomato Functional Genomics Database (http://solgenomics.net/ted) and the Tomato Epigenome database (http://ted.bti.cornell.edu/epigenome).","teal"

Chemical conversion of Hg in snowpack from non-volatile forms to gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) can lead to substantial degassing of Hg from snow, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric deposition. Contrary to the GEM chemistry seen in the midlatitude snowpack, preliminary observations from Toolik Lake, on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, provide evidence that photochemical GEM formation and degassing are suppressed in tundra snow and that for much of the winter, interstitial GEM is actually converted into non-volatile Hg. These patterns result in extended periods when interstitial snowpack air is depleted in GEM. If confirmed, this chemistry would likely signify a net transfer of atmospheric GEM to snow or underlying soils, thereby increasing Hg deposition to tundra ecosystems. Proposed project objectives are to investigate (1) the frequency and underlying processes that determine GEM depletion and formation in arctic snowpack and tundra soils; (2) the degree to which GEM dynamics cause vertical Hg exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and (3) how these processes provide additional sources &#8722; or sinks &#8722; of Hg via atmosphere-surface transfer and snowmelt input. GEM concentrations in soils, snow, and air, as well as vertical exchanges, will be characterized at Toolik Field Station. Measurements will be made by means of a snow-sampling manifold system allowing for fully automated and continuous all-winter measurements of trace gases at multiple depths in the undisturbed snowpack and the atmosphere. These experiments will be supplemented by flux chamber measurements to assess the contribution of the underlying tundra soils. Other trace gas observations, and chemical characterization of soil, snow, melt water, and soil water will be incorporated to assess the environmental and biogeochemical controls on GEM dynamics and the Hg budget. This proposed research will leverage ongoing LTER and NEON projects at the Toolik Field station, providing linkages between in-snow processes, tundra soil and freshwater biogeochemical cycling, pollution import into the Arctic, and ecosystem processes. The project will directly involve high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. It will expand an existing partnership with local high school chemistry classes through research presentations in classrooms, laboratory tours, and data analyses using study results. Dissemination to the scientific community will be accomplished through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and by communication with U.S. and international regulatory agencies. The general public will be reached through news releases, institutional publications, open house events, and a web site.

When preserved in the sedimentary record, these layers often serve as important stratigraphic marker beds that can be correlated spatially and temporally and related to the magnitude, source, and timing of eruptive activity. Sedimentological analysis of these deposits enable investigation of fundamental geologic questions related to arc generation, maintenance, and destruction processes. These include: (1) the rates, timing, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, 2) identification of systematic patterns or variance in the time series of volcanic eruptions in terms of eruptive style, eruption magnitude, and repose periods, (3) assessing the completeness of the onshore record, especially if the marine record contains events not archived onshore, and (4) the nature of volcanism during the construction of a volcanic complex (magma evolution, production rate, eruptive styles, spatio-temporal distribution of eruptive vents and products, and importance of constructional vs. destructional processes). This information is essential to inform assessments of present-day hazards from active arc volcanoes. However, while constraining the long term eruptive history of a volcanic arc before the start of written historical records or beyond well-preserved subaerial tephra fall deposits (often representing only a few thousand years) is important, it is inherently difficult. <br/><br/>Key to establishing an accurate geologic record is the development of a methodology capable of accurate, replicable, quantitative, and routine identification of these tephra layers in marine sediment sequences. Traditionally, tephrochronologic methods have been applied to visible tephra beds that are typically characterized by discrete, often dark-colored depositional layers. This limits tephrochronology studies to areas proximal to volcanic sources capable of producing voluminous deposits. Cryptotephras, fine layers of ash that may not be visible to the naked eye, may either represent smaller eruptions or eruptions from more distal sources. Identification of cryptotephra has now become essential in order to fully constrain the eruptive history of a volcanic center. Previously cryptotephra have been identified by a variety of time-intensive and destructive methods. The goal of this proposal is to document and characterize different sedimentary properties and semi-quantitatively identify the distribution and magnitude of cryptotephras in the sediment record at millimeter scale resolution from the surrounding sedimentary matrix using high resolution continuous scanning techniques. These techniques include: (1) magnetic measurements, particularly magnetic susceptibility; (2) reflectance spectroscopy; (3) core XRF scanning using the ITRAX system; and (4) Computer Tomography (CT) scans. While these four techniques have demonstrated their potential for the identification of tephra, they have rarely been used together, especially at the resolution required to document cryptotephra. Combining these three methodologies will provide a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic, and spectral properties of sediment, all of which have independently been shown to vary substantially with the presence of tephra and also allow evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques for cryptotephra identification. The described techniques will be applied to IODP cores drilled off Montserrat to establish a long term tephrochronologic record of Montserrat and to better constrain the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc. This research will generate: (1) an expanded geologic history of the volcanic system driving Montserrat and an associated hazard assessment; (2) a better understanding of the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc; and (3) an evaluation of a set of techniques that can be used to rapidly identify cryptotephra layers in sediment sequences by non-destructive means.","hot_pink"

Contrary to the GEM chemistry seen in the midlatitude snowpack, preliminary observations from Toolik Lake, on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, provide evidence that photochemical GEM formation and degassing are suppressed in tundra snow and that for much of the winter, interstitial GEM is actually converted into non-volatile Hg. These patterns result in extended periods when interstitial snowpack air is depleted in GEM. If confirmed, this chemistry would likely signify a net transfer of atmospheric GEM to snow or underlying soils, thereby increasing Hg deposition to tundra ecosystems. Proposed project objectives are to investigate (1) the frequency and underlying processes that determine GEM depletion and formation in arctic snowpack and tundra soils; (2) the degree to which GEM dynamics cause vertical Hg exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and (3) how these processes provide additional sources &#8722; or sinks &#8722; of Hg via atmosphere-surface transfer and snowmelt input. GEM concentrations in soils, snow, and air, as well as vertical exchanges, will be characterized at Toolik Field Station. Measurements will be made by means of a snow-sampling manifold system allowing for fully automated and continuous all-winter measurements of trace gases at multiple depths in the undisturbed snowpack and the atmosphere. These experiments will be supplemented by flux chamber measurements to assess the contribution of the underlying tundra soils. Other trace gas observations, and chemical characterization of soil, snow, melt water, and soil water will be incorporated to assess the environmental and biogeochemical controls on GEM dynamics and the Hg budget. This proposed research will leverage ongoing LTER and NEON projects at the Toolik Field station, providing linkages between in-snow processes, tundra soil and freshwater biogeochemical cycling, pollution import into the Arctic, and ecosystem processes. The project will directly involve high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. It will expand an existing partnership with local high school chemistry classes through research presentations in classrooms, laboratory tours, and data analyses using study results. Dissemination to the scientific community will be accomplished through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and by communication with U.S. and international regulatory agencies. The general public will be reached through news releases, institutional publications, open house events, and a web site. Data will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado for distribution to the national and international polar research community.","plum"

Measurements of O2/N2 ratio at Arctic sites, when also combined with measurements at lower latitudes, have the potential to help quantify the magnitude of the seasonal air-sea exchanges of O2 with the Arctic Ocean, which could be a key indicator of biogeochemical change in a time of rapid Arctic warming. Although the land biosphere also contributes to seasonal variations in O2/N2 ratio, the ocean contribution can be resolved by combining O2/N2 and CO2 data to compute the tracer atmospheric potential oxygen (APO), which is effectively an atmospheric tracer of ocean biology and chemistry. This work will draw on support from international collaborators, with the potential to shape Arctic O2/N2 measurements by the international community into a critical component of the AON. Measurements of the 13C/12C ratio and 18O/16O ratio at Arctic sites also may provide key early warning indicators of ecological change. The project will support the archiving of aliquots of atmospheric CO2 in background arctic air to be used for open-ended purposes by future researchers. Finally, the project will support graduate student involvement in the collection and foster collaborations among scientific groups engaged in measurements of O2 and CO2 isotopes in support of detecting Arctic change.","plum"

When preserved in the sedimentary record, these layers often serve as important stratigraphic marker beds that can be correlated spatially and temporally and related to the magnitude, source, and timing of eruptive activity. Sedimentological analysis of these deposits enable investigation of fundamental geologic questions related to arc generation, maintenance, and destruction processes. These include: (1) the rates, timing, frequency and magnitude of volcanic eruptions, 2) identification of systematic patterns or variance in the time series of volcanic eruptions in terms of eruptive style, eruption magnitude, and repose periods, (3) assessing the completeness of the onshore record, especially if the marine record contains events not archived onshore, and (4) the nature of volcanism during the construction of a volcanic complex (magma evolution, production rate, eruptive styles, spatio-temporal distribution of eruptive vents and products, and importance of constructional vs. destructional processes). This information is essential to inform assessments of present-day hazards from active arc volcanoes. However, while constraining the long term eruptive history of a volcanic arc before the start of written historical records or beyond well-preserved subaerial tephra fall deposits (often representing only a few thousand years) is important, it is inherently difficult. <br/><br/>Key to establishing an accurate geologic record is the development of a methodology capable of accurate, replicable, quantitative, and routine identification of these tephra layers in marine sediment sequences. Traditionally, tephrochronologic methods have been applied to visible tephra beds that are typically characterized by discrete, often dark-colored depositional layers. This limits tephrochronology studies to areas proximal to volcanic sources capable of producing voluminous deposits. Cryptotephras, fine layers of ash that may not be visible to the naked eye, may either represent smaller eruptions or eruptions from more distal sources. Identification of cryptotephra has now become essential in order to fully constrain the eruptive history of a volcanic center. Previously cryptotephra have been identified by a variety of time-intensive and destructive methods. The goal of this proposal is to document and characterize different sedimentary properties and semi-quantitatively identify the distribution and magnitude of cryptotephras in the sediment record at millimeter scale resolution from the surrounding sedimentary matrix using high resolution continuous scanning techniques. These techniques include: (1) magnetic measurements, particularly magnetic susceptibility; (2) reflectance spectroscopy; (3) core XRF scanning using the ITRAX system; and (4) Computer Tomography (CT) scans. While these four techniques have demonstrated their potential for the identification of tephra, they have rarely been used together, especially at the resolution required to document cryptotephra. Combining these three methodologies will provide a comprehensive assessment and evaluation of the sedimentological, geochemical, magnetic, and spectral properties of sediment, all of which have independently been shown to vary substantially with the presence of tephra and also allow evaluation of the efficacy of these techniques for cryptotephra identification. The described techniques will be applied to IODP cores drilled off Montserrat to establish a long term tephrochronologic record of Montserrat and to better constrain the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc. This research will generate: (1) an expanded geologic history of the volcanic system driving Montserrat and an associated hazard assessment; (2) a better understanding of the evolution of the Lesser Antilles arc; and (3) an evaluation of a set of techniques that can be used to rapidly identify cryptotephra layers in sediment sequences by non-destructive means.","hot_pink"

The biofuel industry, characterized by new and incremental process innovation, differs from other manufacturing because it is resource-based, it is localized, it is driven by policy and alliances, and it has high levels of uncertainty in the incubation and commercialization of new feedstock-based production. These conditions facilitate risk-balancing organizational networks that result in the formation of a geographically embedded technological innovation system. The development of second-generation biofuels using cellulosic technologies has introduced new process-development possibilities, which cannot be accomplished within the boundaries of a single firm or a region. This project will examine firm-level adjustments as biofuel production expands from kernel-based to second-generation (cellulosic) technologies. The investigators will analyze firm performance and the role of the producer within the U.S. biomass-based biofuel technological innovation system. They will focus on analysis of answers to two specific sets of questions: (1) What internal and external factors determine innovation and business performance in biofuel firms, and to what extent do biofuel firms depend on local policy and partners to improve performance? (2) How do adjustments in firm-level processes affect system-wide functions, and how do firms shape and reshape the overall environment of biofuel innovation and production? Data will be gathered from surveys and archived documents, with both quantitative and qualitative methods used to understand factors affecting the evolution of this industry.<br/><br/>The project will advance basic understanding of localized renewable energy production. It will develop a conceptual and analytical framework transferable to other energy industries, industries with non-assembled products, or any emerging geographically embedded technological innovation system. It will advance studies of innovation and firm performance, which occupy a central place in economic geography. While most studies have focused focus on product innovation and manufacturing, this project will focus on a resource-based industry and process innovation. Resource industries have critical and distinct roles to play in the debate over economy and environment. Process-oriented technological change is vital to firm performance and industrial advancement. The project will contribute toward economic geography theorizing by moving beyond industrial demography and case studies through its analysis of many firms and the effect of their actions on the larger industry. The project also will have policy implications, which will emerge from the analysis of firm adjustments to changes in their external environment.","maroon"

In a TUSK system, a tethered, rigid-winged hydro-kite is submerged in an ocean or tidal current and controlled to move in high-speed cross-current motions. A turbine is mounted on the hydro-kite in one TUSK concept, or the flexible unwinding tether transmits generated hydrodynamic forces to a power generation system in another concept. TUSK systems have potential advantages over conventional marine turbines, mainly that TUSK systems will be able to generate cost-effective energy with; 1) smaller, less costly systems, and 2) at more locations within ocean currents and tidal flows where current speeds are too low to make marine turbines feasible. The main benefits are: 1) the hydro-kite can move in high-speed cross-current motions (much like a kite in air) over large swept areas to greatly increase power output,<br/>2) TUSK systems eliminate the need for large diameter turbines and costly support structures, 3) TUSK systems are easier to maintain, and 4) TUSK systems are scalable.<br/><br/>The main goal of the proposed work is to identify and select an optimum TUSK concept and then demonstrate feasibility through modeling, numerical simulation and sub-scale experimental work. A fundamental knowledge base for design of stable, scalable, durable, and cost-efficient tethered undersea kites will be obtained. This knowledge will serve as the basis for further scaling and development of the technology to full-scale systems.<br/><br/>This project will lay the foundation for understanding how such systems behave by integrating analytical models and robust control solutions, numerical simulations with sufficient accuracy suitable for system design, and physical experiments on TUSK system components where we partner with a local hydrodynamics research lab. The proposed work will advance knowledge in hydrodynamics of underwater vehicles, novel control system applications, and numerical simulation of complex systems. The project will examine tracking controllers to yield optimal periodic trajectories in the presence of modeling errors and disturbances. The proposed numerical simulations will constitute the first CFD work on tethered undersea kite systems, fully accounting for hydrodynamic forces, support platform motions, and the flexibility and influence of the tethers. The integrated work will allow the PIs to examine the behavior and robustness of the system under different conditions and control solutions to improve the design of TUSK systems.<br/><br/>This research project will set the stage for the further study and eventual full-scale deployment of this new energy conversion technology by the systems and control, CFD, and hydrokinetic energy communities as well as commercial enterprises, through dissemination of the results at conferences and in archival journals. The research will be strongly integrated with undergraduate and K12 education through undergraduate.","coral"

It will transmit data wirelessly through acoustic waves from sub-surface ocean sensors to a receiving array with a surface connection to satellites and the Internet. The PIs will expand the limits and capabilities of underwater communication networks in the transition zone where sea ice changes from 1) smooth land-fast ice to 2) ridged mobile ice to 3) open water. This transition zone evolves in both time and space within the 30-50 km foot-print of the proposed networked sensor and communication network array. This goal requires integration of both existing knowledge from a set of diverse disciplines and intellectual innovations within each discipline. It will modify underwater communication network theory, coastal acoustic propagation and scattering, and experimental design of oceanography. Providing long-term, long-range acoustic connectivity, the PI team will address three major new research challenges: 1) Mid-frequency (1-5 kHz), mid-range (10 km) acoustic wave propagation in the transition zone; 2) Data telemetry in the new communication environment; and 3) Resilient sensor networks that cope with and harness complex dynamics of the transition zone. The multi-disciplinary team will implement reliable modem hardware, integrate it with resilient network protocol, and optimize the system design for Arctic deployment to support an ocean experiment off Thule, Greenland.<br/><br/>The sensor and communication network will support 1) long-term, intelligent distributed Arctic observing systems, 2) assimilation of remote-sensing and in-situ under-ice measurements, and 3) regional and global climate modeling with real-time measurements. Such a network holds the promise to revolutionize under-ice ocean sampling in polar regions. Data will be broadly disseminated via the web and archived for public access. Planned outreach includes participation in the field program of Greenlandic residents from the Inupiat village of Qaanaaq and meaningful classroom involvement from the elementary to community college levels. The PIs are also committed to outreach through their global print, radio, TV, and electronic media contacts.","plum"

Broad objectives of this proposal are (a) to empower the researcher to exploit and tailor LiDAR post-processing to optimize data quality and meet science driven spatial and accuracy requirements and (b) to empower the scientist to focus on science questions without the need to consider time-consuming reformatting, data storage georeferencing and error estimation tasks. The developed tools would be amendable to both processing and analysis of airborne LiDAR, mobile laser scanning (MLS) observations, and static terrestrial (tripod) LiDAR data and would allow for tools to process full waveform observations. Scientific applications of high resolution LIDAR surface mapping span the fields of geomorphology, geodesy, hydrology, forestry, and resource management to name a few. The number of geoscientists employing LIDAR mapping for research is growing rapidly. A graduate student will be supported by this project and the resultant software will be distributed to users through the OpenTopography web portal and will be open source.

This project aims to develop a relatively untapped reservoir of paleomagnetic and rock magnetic information, speleothems (e.g., stalagmites, and flowstone). Speleothems have immense potential for archiving high quality, high resolution geomagnetic records, and can be dated with supreme precision using radiometric techniques. This research investigates the fundamental processes involved in natural remanence acquisition in speleothems using rock magnetic and microscopic imaging techniques, and establishes chronological constraints for geomagnetic field behavior during specific periods in the last 130 ka.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research project is to construct high-resolution records of geomagnetic field behavior and paleoclimate conditions using the iron oxide mineral assemblages preserved within speleothems. We will address both the mechanical transport and chemical precipitation of iron oxide minerals in speleothems in order to better understand how and when speleothems acquire a recording of the Earth's magnetic field. Recent instrumental progress provides the sensitivity and sample handling capabilities needed to collect a rich variety of magnetic measurements from speleothems, at an unprecedented spatial resolution. The investigation of speleothem magnetization on a sub-millimeter scale will advance the understanding of magnetic processes in speleothems, ranging from changing dripwater conditions to episodic flooding that can be used to produce regional paleohydrology records. Precisely dated, high fidelity paleomagnetic records from speleothems will help better constrain time-dependent, global geomagnetic field models. An additional benefit of having detailed, high-precision chronologies of paleomagnetic variations is that the chronological information can be transferred to existing deposits with correlatable paleomagnetic records, but with less constrained age models (e.g., archaeological sites, and/or sediment cores). High resolution geomagnetic fluctuations recovered from speleothems will contribute valuable information to geodynamo models that focus on small-scale core flow dynamics. The environmental magnetic records of speleothems will bridge the gap that exists between climatic and environmental interpretations from traditional speleothem measurements such as oxygen isotopes, and the environmental magnetic records of other depositional environments.","hot_pink"

This final grant will bring the world's only full-century Time Domain Astrophysics (TDA) database and analysis tools on line for the full community to utilize as a key survey that complements current surveys (PTF, CRT and PS1) and provides long-term context for LSST. The high speed precision DASCH scanner (two 8 x 10in imaging plates digitized into 11&#956;m pixels in 90 sec) and initial astrometry and photometry have now i) improved astrometry that allows multiple exposure plate solutions as well as initial astrometry essentially independent of what the plate jacket might have indicated, ii) improved photometry. We build the Pipeline and Database software and hardware to enable the original goal to scan and fully process ~400 plates/day, which would enable the full collection of ~450,000 direct imaging plates to be scanned and fully reduced, with rapid access to images (thumbnails), lightcurves , and data products on spinning disk. The present effort will finish the production scanning, overnight processing, and full data releases (DRs, in 10 installments) of the ~375,000 plates remaining. Although a single field (6o centered on M44, our first ""development field"") is now in the public domain, the limited coverage presents the novel TDA surveys that DASCH can do for discovery and study of rare classes of variables which require larger survey coverage. <br/><br/>DASCH incorporates students at every stage and a vigorous program of Public Outreach. This research will open the astronomical window of time variability on long timescales (months-100y) from currently existing, but inaccessible and barely-mined data. Digitization is the key and can now be done with our new ultra-high speed scanner and high speed processing and database. Accessing the past data complements present (e.g. PanSTARRS) and future temporal surveys (LSST). Opening this new temporal window has already revealed new phenomena; it will surely excite new students and the public at large.<br/>This project will awaken the public awareness that the universe is not static. Evolution and change are the rule, not the exception. The impact on science education can be large: by showing on the project website segments of the ""cosmic movie"" of giant flares from quasars or stars, or the heart beat pulsations of Cepheid variables, students will better understand the excitement of current astronomy. Physical understanding of the dynamic universe is even more enticing than the immutable sky. The public website to be fully developed by this investigation will be fully accessible to the public and astronomical community. DASCH will have significant impact on the general drive to Temporal Surveys for a number of projects now in development.

Acorn woodpeckers live in family groups of up to 15 individuals containing a combination of ""helpers""--young that remain in their natal group and help raise younger siblings--and multiple breeders of both sexes, a rare mating system known as polygynandry found in several primate species. Researchers will combine cutting edge tracking technology with long-term demographic data, experimental studies, and genetic analyses to understand why helpers sacrifice reproduction to feed young that are not their own, and why helpers vary so much in their willingness to help their parents raise other siblings. The project will involve the training of a postdoctoral associate, a Ph.D. student, and 36 - 60 undergraduate and recent postgraduate students who will participate in the field and laboratory aspects of the study. The lead researchers will communicate their findings to the public through publications, outreach activities of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and television documentaries.<br/><br/>The project will focus specifically on determining: (1) the extent to which provisioning behavior by helpers per se, rather than other behaviors unrelated to provisioning that helpers engage in on their territory, is responsible for the indirect fitness benefits gained by helpers that remain in their natal group; (2) whether individual variability in helping behavior is due to differences in the amount of time helpers spend away from their natal territory or differences in their provisioning effort while present at the territory; and (3) the role that direct fitness benefits such as experience gained by helping or ""pay-to-stay"" play in the evolution of provisioning behavior. These goals will be achieved by (i) combining over 40 years of continuous monitoring of a color-banded population in which parentage is assigned genetically; (ii) conducting behavioral watches of provisioning behavior; and (iii) deploying solar-powered ""nanotags"" that will allow researchers to continuously monitor the location of individuals in the population. The project will disentangle the fitness benefits and drivers of provisioning behavior by helpers, thus providing a new understanding of the evolution of this putatively altruistic behavior. Data associated with specific publications will be made available in Dryad, whereas the more general datasets acquired as part of the project will be archived either with the Network Information System (NIS) designed for the LTER program (when it is expanded to include other long-term projects) or, alternatively, as a collection within the iPlant Data Store funded by the NSF Division of Biological Infrastucture.","teal"

Yet much of our current language technology fails to account for how language varies across social contexts, or how it depends on speakers' attitudes and identities. As a consequence, existing language technology is brittle to variation, particularly in non-standard dialects and informal social contexts. This CAREER project is aimed at closing this gap, by building data-driven computational algorithms and representations that are capable of identifying social meaning in large corpora of text and speech. The scope of the research includes local social variables, such as the address terms used to modulate formality in conversation (""Ms"", ""dude""), as well as group-level dialect differences across large communities. The expected results of the research include: (1) new computational methods for studying language's social function and, correspondingly, new insights; (2) leveraging these insights to enable new computational linguistic applications, and to improve the robustness of existing technology; (3) better engagement between computer science and the social sciences in augmenting the tools that researchers require in order to access large-scale naturally occurring social and linguistic data; and (4) improved education on the analysis and interpretation of such data for undergraduate and graduate students and the public at large.<br/><br/>This project uses unsupervised structure induction techniques to identify the latent structures that connect linguistic and social phenomena. Sociolinguistic structures can be mined from a diverse array of data sources, including social media and digitized humanities archives.

Identifying these sociolinguistic structures requires new learning algorithms and representations, driven by theoretical insights from the social sciences.

Far less common has been the use of patents to record inventions that have changed the ways in which maps are produced and portrayed. This project will analyze the role of the patents system in stimulating and recording cartographic creativity. The investigators will examine inventors as well as inventions, and it will focus on the technological, social, and intellectual context in which new map products and new techniques for making or using maps were deemed sufficiently original and non-obvious to warrant patent protection. The project will provide a complementary perspective to the literature dominated by academic and government cartographers. The project will yield new information and insights about those forms of cartographic innovation that have been patented. Project outcomes will include a biographical directory of cartographic inventors and their patents that the investigator and others can use to explore the personal and social motives of cartographic innovators, their contacts with other inventors, and the temporal context and impact of their inventions. The project therefore will stimulate fundamental thinking in map history, the history of sciences, geographer, and other scholarly fields. Another outcome of the project is expected to be a book accessible to lay readers examining this understudied aspect of creativity and innovation. The project will provide education and training experience for a graduate student. Data gathered during the conduct of the project will be deposited with the Geography and Map Division of the U.S. Library of Congress and other collections that will assist in the online dissemination of these data.<br/><br/>The project will expand upon two pilot studies. One pilot examined the diverse types of map-related U.S. patents awarded between 1840 and 2012 that were classified as ""Printed matter--map"" or ""Printed matter--indexed maps."" The other pilot studied the education, employment, and residential histories of two inventors and their efforts to exploit their patents. During the conduct of this project, the investigators will broaden the database to include other arenas of cartographic creativity, in particular map-related inventions assigned to the ""Education and Demonstration"" category. The principal research approach to be used in the conduct of this project is examination of ""Big Microdata,"" a collective term for newspaper, bibliographic, and patents databases as well as individual-level archival population records like those provided online by Ancestry.com and Familysearch.org, which integrate information from city directories, pre-1950 Census schedules, and the diverse vital and public records used by genealogical researchers. In addition to broadening the scope of historical scholarship about mapping to include the systematic analysis of many little-known innovators, the investigators will provide an evidence-based critique of the concepts of utility, novelty, and patentability; the effectiveness of the patents system in maintaining standards of originality and non-obviousness.

The tools are collectively called CRESCAT (Computational Research Ecosystem for Scientific Collaboration on Ancient Topics). The initial focus is on disciplines that deal with dynamic interactions and structural changes within spatially situated populations over long time spans in the past, e.g., paleobiology, archaeology, and economic history. Despite their differences, these disciplines have similar computational needs for modeling and analyzing data. Moreover, the same software can be used in many other disciplines, enabling economies of scale by building and maintaining a common set of interoperable tools to serve a wide range of researchers, while spanning the full research data life cycle, consisting of (1) acquisition, (2) integration, (3) analysis, (4) publication, and (5) archiving of data. An intuitive graphical user interface is provided for end-user researchers to work with their data in all stages of the life cycle without cumbersome manual data transfers and transformations. The project will address a major computational problem that affects many scientific disciplines due to the challenge of integrating and analyzing data of diverse origins based on heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and taxonomic ontologies. Thus it will have a broad impact in the sciences and beyond by showing how to represent explicitly the full variability of individual judgments and the divergent conceptualizations and terminologies through which those judgments are expressed, with explicit attribution of each observation, interpretation, and conceptual ontology to a particular named person or group. Unlike many computational tools for scientific research, which assume a degree of ontological consensus that does not exist, CRESCAT conforms to actual research practices. It does not impose a standardized ontology, thereby ignoring or suppressing the inevitable disagreements and conflicting interpretations that arise among researchers. Instead, it represents ontological diversity, observational uncertainty, and interpretive disagreement explicitly within a larger common framework in which end users can query, analyze, and compare the full range of observations, interpretations, and terminologies to inform their own judgments about the evidence. CRESCAT is designed to allow scientific disagreements and observational and interpretive uncertainties to be represented digitally in a way that exposes these differences themselves as data for analysis and debate. Thus, in addition to the practical goal of building a more efficient shared framework for advanced research, the proposed work will provoke theoretical reflection about how computational tools should relate to scientific practice.<br/><br/>The CRESCAT project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, paleobiologists, geoscientists, archaeologists, economic historians, and other social scientists. The goal is to demonstrate the value of an integrative software ecosystem that spans the social and natural sciences and can facilitate any research characterized by overlapping models of temporal and spatial relations or by conflicting terminologies and taxonomies. CRESCAT's representation of scientific knowledge eschews forced standardization, which is impractical in many cases due to lack of an enforcement mechanism and is also questionable in principle since divergent ontologies often legitimately reflect different theoretical assumptions and research agendas. Central to the CRESCAT suite of tools is an innovative data-integration system that represents explicitly both research data and the ontologies inherent in the data. An ontology is defined here as a conceptual model of entities and the relationships among them in a given domain of knowledge, in contrast to a schema,&#148;which is the implementation of an ontology in logical data structures within a working system. CRESCAT's data-integration system operates at a level of abstraction sufficient to provide a predictable and efficiently queryable database structure based on an abstract global schema, which in turn is based on an upper ontology specified in terms of fundamental concepts and relationships applicable to all scientific and scholarly disciplines. The data-integration system is implemented in an enterprise-class XML/XQuery DBMS that serves as a data warehouse (using the non-relational graph data model), in which is stored diverse data from a wide range of research projects representing many disciplines. The terminology and conceptual distinctions of each research project are fully preserved. The approach to research data taken in the CRESCAT project is (1) coherent, tightly integrating software tools and data formats within a single analytical framework; (2) open-ended, interconnecting existing tools while allowing the addition of new tools in the future; (3) non-exclusive, in no way preventing its component tools from participating in other software ecosystems; (4) scalable, designed to handle large-scale data management, analysis, and visualization; and (5) sustainable, maintaining shared resources to meet common needs for software and technical support and thus enabling substantial economies of scale.","mauve"

A century ago, only 2 out of 10 did. To understand the wide-ranging implications and challenges of this rapid transformation of the typical human habitat, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program funds scientific research on contemporary urban environments. The focus of this project is the changing nature of urban public space. In parks, squares, and sidewalks, city dwellers encounter each other and engage in public activities that help forge the bonds of community and citizenship. Historically, access to such spaces has been uneven across urban populations. This research project seeks to understand the changing functions of urban public space today.<br/><br/>Dr. Julian B. Brash of Montclair State University will carry out the research in New York City. Many American cities have seen restrictions on the use of public spaces and the conversion of public spaces into private ones. However, recently a number of new, high profile urban public spaces with more open access have been constructed. A particularly prominent example is a mile-long linear park built on an abandoned, elevated spur of the New York Central Railway. Using this new space as a case example, the researcher will investigate who uses such spaces, for what purposes, and how they relate to broader political, economic, social, and cultural changes in the urban environment. The researcher employs a mixed-methods scientific strategy. He and his team will conduct a formal survey of park users; carry out systematic behavioral observation scans; sample and analyze de-identified social media communications generated at the park; and carry out archival and other secondary source research. This project will generate knowledge about the changing functions and meanings of urban public space that will help build a new social scientific science of contemporary human environments.","maroon"

Using the case of Haitian migrant farm workers in Immokalee, FL, this research investigates the availability, provision, utilization, and accessibility of prenatal care to immigrant women in order to understand not only the specific issues that these women face in trying to maintain their health during pregnancy, but also the broader political, economic, and social processes that contribute to immigrant women's health disparities across the United States. The research is expected to fill scholarly and clinical gaps in understanding the socio-spatial factors influencing immigrant health, the politics of immigrant health care, rural and minority health disparities, and the emerging impacts of the Affordable Care Act on the health care system more broadly. It also explores the methodological possibilities offered by qualitative GIS to health researchers and planners by producing dynamic maps that show the complex relationship between gender, politics, economics, and health care. <br/><br/>Using a critical medical geography framework, the researchers draw from interdisciplinary literatures on healthcare, intersectionality, immigration, and critical GIS.

Second, it uses interview data from health care providers to explain how the changing politics of immigrant health care affects the provision of care for immigrant women. Third, using feminist qualitative GIS and multi-session in-depth interviewing, the project investigates immigrant women's experiences of the health care system, as well as how these experiences influence where and how they utilize health care services. Finally, it identifies the socio-spatial barriers that immigrant women face in accessing care in an effort to improve health care accessibility in the community.","maroon"

Much is known about how intertidal algae react to natural stresses, but little is known about the natural community of bacteria associated with these algae. Past studies in the laboratory found that some 'seaweeds' disintegrate after removal of their bacteria with antibiotics suggesting these bacteria are essential to the health of their hosts. This research will examine the genetic, taxonomic, and functional aspects of biodiversity of bacteria associated with several 'seaweeds' that are particularly important to the general health of marine ecosystems. The research will determine how these bacteria change with season, position within the intertidal zone and latitudinal range. Stability or change in the bacterial species associated with a host will be examined by studying the particular bacterial genes that are present at different sampling times and by studying host responses to inoculations with particular bacteria. The work will also study whether any bacteria are inhibited by the environmental extremes found across the intertidal zone or over latitude, especially at the southern borders of a host's range where climate change may disturb the bacterial community on the host. Researchers will deposit isolates and voucher specimens into public collections, and, in collaboration with trained citizen scientists, will provide digital access to all algal materials within the University of Maine Herbarium. The multi-faceted data collected during this research will aid studies by other intertidal ecologists.<br/><br/> How macroalgal microbiomes change in space and time is poorly known. Is there a 'cool, wet' versus a 'hot, dry' macroalgal microbiome(s)? If so, how does this affect host function? Here, microbiomes will be characterized over the vertical gradient of the intertidal zone on the Maine shore in differentially zoned species within each of two prominent genera, Fucus (rockweed) and Porphyra (laver). Contemporaneously, a trans-Atlantic study of microbiomes of the mid-zone Porphyra umbilicalis and Fucus vesiculosus will determine whether compositional changes found over an intertidal stress gradient are mirrored over the latitudinal range of mid-zoned species. If so, does this matter? This question will be answered by using shotgun metagenomic analyses to compare the genetic composition with the characterized taxonomic composition of the macroalgal microbiomes. Environmental variation associated with microbiome collections will be measured with in situ sensors and from archival and real time data available from government climate services (e.g., NOAA). The potential to detect changes over historic time will be assessed using herbarium specimens. To study bacteria that are likely to be most critical to normal structure and function of Fucus and Porphyra, the researchers will focus on bacterial isolations from spores and fertilized eggs, aided by flow cytometry and single cell genomics. To establish the criticality of these associations, microbiome-depleted embryos will be inoculated with such bacterial isolates, and the resulting interaction will be investigated by analysis of the host transcriptome with RNA-Seq. The temperature tolerance of key bacterial species (operational taxonomic units) will be established in laboratory experiments. This research will serve as an important trans-Atlantic baseline of the biodiversity of macroalgal microbiomes.","salmon"

The Himalayan-Tibetan orogen is the classic example of a mountain belt that has formed by continent-continent collision due to the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Conventional geologic understanding suggest that most of the uplift is occurred during the Cenozoic. In contrast, the principal investigators hypothesize that much of the crustal shortening and thickening recorded by rocks in this area occurred during Late Jurassic to middle Cretaceous time. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will conduct a multidisciplinary investigation that will involve geologic and structural mapping, stratigraphic analysis, geochronologic and and thermochronologic dating. The results of this project will provide new insights in to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Pamir region of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic belt. In addition to the scientific goals of the research, the project is contributing to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in the geosciences, an important STEM discipline. The project will contribute to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences, which is an important societal outcome. The project will facilitate international collaboration between researchers at U.S., Italy, and Tajikistan, and will build important institutional collaborations between two U.S. universities. The project will include outreach efforts that include lectures and workshops on the Geology of the Pamir for students at the University of Dushanbe in order to promote geoscience education and science literacy in this developing country. The outcomes of the research will be published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and presentations at professional society meetings; isotopic and geochemical data will be archived in web-based community databases.<br/><br/><br/>Over the last decade, increased evidence has shown that much of the crustal shortening and thickening in the Tibetan plateau is Cretaceous in age, pre-dating the Cenozoic collision between India and Asia. However, it is still unclear how laterally extensive, or spatially variable, pre-Cenozoic shortening and thickening is across the entire orogen. This study will provide important information on the timing and magnitude of crustal shortening over a broad region of the western portion of the Tibetan orogen and address important questions regarding the along-strike continuity of pre-Cenozoic deformation in the Tibetan orogen. Further, while significant Cenozoic crustal thickening in the Pamir has been documented in Miocene to Recent gneiss domes, early calculations of the magnitude of upper crustal shortening have been shown to be significantly overestimated, raising important questions regarding the mechanism of Cenozoic crustal thickening (i.e. underthrusting vs. pure shear thickening). The results of this will also provide new information in understanding the mechanisms of crustal thickening in the Pamir region. The specific goal of this study involves testing the hypothesis that much of the crustal shortening and thickening in the Central and Southern Pamir is Mesozoic in age (rather than Cenozoic, as previously interpreted) and represents the along-strike continuation of extensive Late Jurassic-middle Cretaceous crustal shortening and thickening documented in Tibet. The project will include detailed geologic mapping and structural analysis to evaluate crustal shortening in the Pamir; stratigraphic analyses of coarse terrigenous deposits found throughout the region to evaluate whether the deposits are syntectonic with regional shortening structures; geochronologic (detrital U-Pb zircon) and thermochronologic (detrital muscovite 40Ar/39Ar dating, and detrital AFT/AHe double dating) analyses of coarse terrigenous deposits to determine the age of deposition in order to evaluate timing of regional shortening; thermochronologic analyses of basement terranes involved in regional shortening to evaluate timing of shortening related exhumation.","hot_pink"

The South Pole ice core will allow investigation of atmospheric trace gases and fill an important gap in understanding the pattern of climate variability across Antarctica. An accurate timescale that assigns an age to the ice at each depth in the core is essential to interpretation of the ice-core records. This work will use electrical methods to identify volcanic eruptions throughout the past ~40,000 years in the core by detecting the enhanced electrical conductance in those layers due to volcanic impurities in the ice. These eruptions will be pattern-matched to other cores across Antarctica, synchronizing the timing of climate variations among cores and allowing the precise timescales developed for other Antarctic ice cores to be transferred to the South Pole ice core. The well-dated records of volcanic forcing will be combined with records of atmospheric gases, stable water-isotopes, and aerosols to better understand the large natural climate variations of the past 40,000 years. <br/><br/>The electrical conductance method and dielectric profiling measurements will be made along the length of each section of the South Pole ice core at the National Ice Core Lab. These measurements will help to establish a timescale for the core. Electrical measurements will provide a continuous record of volcanic events for the entire core including through the brittle ice (550-1250m representing ~10,000-20,000 year-old ice) where the core quality and thin annual layers may prevent continuous melt analysis and cause discrete measurements to miss volcanic events. The electrical measurements also produce a 2-D image of the electrical layering on a longitudinal cut surface of each core. These data will be used to identify any irregular or absent layering that would indicate a stratigraphic disturbance in the core. A robust chronology is essential to interpretation of the paleoclimate records from the South Pole ice core.

The isotopic composition of diatom-bound organic nitrogen is one of the best hopes for reconstructing the nutrient status of polar surface waters over glacial cycles, which in turn may hold the explanation for the decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide during ice ages. The PIs propose to generate detailed diatom-bound nitrogen isotope (&#948;15Ndb) records from high sedimentation rate cores from the Kerguelen Plateau. Because the cores were collected at relatively shallow seafloor depths, they have adequate planktonic and benthic foraminifera to develop accurate age models. The resulting data could be compared with climate records from Antarctic ice cores and other archives to investigate climate-related changes, including the major steps into and out of ice ages and the millennial-scale events that occur during ice ages and at their ends. The records generated in this project will provide a critical test of hypotheses for the cause of lower ice age CO2.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>This study will contribute to the goal of understanding ice ages and past CO2 changes, which both have broad implications for future climate.

The research team is also collaborating with local environmental groups and researchers at each study site to develop field-based public outreach programs.<br/><br/>The researchers engaged in this collaborative project will experimentally manipulate phenotype and exposure to stressors in a widely distributed songbird, the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), to determine whether variation in specific components of the stress response are causally linked to behavior, phenotypic damage, gene expression, and fitness. Novel techniques that enable the manipulation of the hormonal stress response in free-living and freely-behaving birds will be coupled with advances in remote monitoring and tracking to reveal the detailed behavioral changes and fitness effects of variation in the hormonal stress response. The potential for selection to shape the efficacy of negative feedback will be assessed by estimating the heritability and consistency of trait expression within and across seasons. Coordinated experiments across four populations that breed in differing environments from Alaska to Tennessee will address how variation in specific components of the stress response influence the ability to survive and reproduce in the presence of stressors. The data obtained through this project will be stored in databases maintained by the Principal Investigator and collaborators, and archived through the Cornell eCommons facility. Data will be provided as supplementary material to publications, and made publicly available within five years of the conclusion of the project.","teal"

Information about how to increase their effectiveness promises to improve the performance and competitiveness of organizations in the U.S. and the well being of their members. Our proposed research has implications not only for teams in traditional work settings but also in new emerging settings such as distributed work teams and online communities. We identify the patterns of communication that lead to the strongest transactive memory and the highest team performance. Thus, the research will result in information that team members and leaders can use to improve their team's performance. In addition, the development of a behavioral measure of TMS would enable researchers to analyze TMS in large teams and geographically distributed contexts, which are becoming increasingly prevalent in organizations and online communities around the world. All together, the results have the potential to advance our understanding of team collaboration, team formation, communication networks and team performance.<br/><br/>The research examines the effects of communication networks on transactive memory system development and team performance. A transactive memory system (TMS) is a collective system for encoding, storing and retrieving information. Teams with well-developed TMSs have been found to perform better across a variety of tasks compared to teams lacking TMSs. Known as systems of ""who knows what,"" a TMS emerges through communications and interactions among team members as they learn and rely on each other's skills and knowledge. Although a TMS hinges on communication and interaction, very little research has been conducted on how communication networks affect a group's TMS. Communication networks constrain or enable communication within a team and thus potentially alter the development of TMS. Our research investigates the characteristics of communication networks that enhance the development of TMS in a series of studies incorporating complementary laboratory and archival methods. First, we manipulate the communication networks that exist within teams in an experiment to examine the effects of network characteristics on the team's TMS and performance. We investigate two dimensions of team performance: the number of errors and creativity. Second, because in many contexts individuals choose their own networks and/or their positions within the network, we compare the effects of networks and position assignments that are imposed by the experimenter to those that are chosen by participants. This enables us to determine if effects observed are due to the communication network itself or due to participants' enactment of the network. By manipulating the networks and using random assignment to networks and to positions within the networks, we are able to make causal statements about the effects of network characteristics on TMS development and team performance. Third, using data from our experiments, we will develop and refine a new unobtrusive, behavioral measure of TMS. This measure will be applied to data from real teams who use online networks for large-scale technology-mediated projects. Following the validation of this new TMS measure, we will examine how it relates to performance for large online teams.","crimson"

These atlases highlight the work of standardizing Traditional Chinese Medicine to mirror western medicine, and thus legitimate its practice, while simultaneously mapping invisible meridians that fall outside the regular purview of evidence-based Western medicine. In addition to engaging in archival research, the project will also involve conducting a limited number of interviews with individuals affiliated with the production and circulation of acupuncture atlases in the United Kingdom, the United States, and China. Besides publishing the results of this research in scholarly journals, the visual and textual components of this project will serve as material in documentary filmmaking to reach beyond the confines of academia and engage with broader concerns in health care. The author has extensive experience in digital media that will facilitate using the results of this research to make short films that will contribute a global, non-western, human-centered perspective of medicine to a broader audience. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to demonstrate how two seemingly disparate medical practices, Chinese medicine and biomedicine, became entangled. The project will provide a comparative analysis of the production of two texts, Celestial Lancets (1980), and Acupuncture (1981). The body maps collected and reproduced in these two case studies will serve as sites for examining medical theory and medical practice. Among the research questions to be addressed are the following. How were medical practices articulated as science? What did illustrations of the body define and obscure? The project adopts a transnational perspective and a multidisciplinary approach. It builds on and departs from studies in the history of the body, visualization and representation in science, and post-colonial science and technology. This is not just a project about the making of maps, but about how the private lives of historical actors entangled with standardizing a narrative of the body was situated within a global history of experimentation and practice.","crimson"

However, not all slip across faults is abrupt. Indeed, for some faults, appreciable slip may occur without shaking the ground making them difficult to detect using traditional seismograph instruments. Understanding the difference between these two types of fault slip behavior is critical to our ability to gauge potential earthquake threats posed by active fault zones worldwide, including numerous hazardous fault zones in the United States. One of the best examples of a fault that appears to frequently slip with and without creating large earthquakes is the Alto Tiberina fault located in central Italy. The unusual geometry of this fault, which makes it among the most accessible faults in the world to studies using near surface observations, provides a unique opportunity to investigate the physical characteristics of faults that slide with and without violently shaking the ground. It is an ideal target for documenting the conditions under which faults pose the greatest threat of damaging earthquakes. <br/><br/>The new collaboration that will be forged with support from the National Science Foundation Catalyzing New International Collaborations (CNIC) program sets the stage for the deployment of a network of modern strainmeter instruments designed specifically to detect small but diagnostic slip events on the Alto Tiberina fault across a very broad spectrum of fault behaviors. When combined with existing seismograph and geodetic technologies that have already been deployed by Italian partners, the new strainmeter network will allow for the first time measurements of the frequency, duration, and magnitude of sliding events, and their relationship to ground motion and earthquakes. The first task toward understanding fault slip behavior is the establishment of a Memorandum of Understanding outlining all aspects of the international collaboration, including: the roles and responsibilities for funding, siting, permitting, telemetry, data flow and archiving, routine site maintenance, data processing, and scientific collaboration. The formal collaboration that will be established will (1) enhance future research opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers from US-based institutions, (2) prepare the next generation of earthquake fault researchers in the United States, (3) provide future generations of United States scientists with significant professional experience beyond political borders early in their careers, and (4) generate a wealth of new information that will inform earthquake hazards assessments throughout the United States.","chartreuse"

However, the risk of adverse health effects, such as from the potential carcinogenicity of CNTs are not understood. The PI, and Co-PI, have developed a chronic exposure model in which human lung epithelial cells, a major cellular target of CNT carcinogenesis, are exposed, over long-term, to low-dose physiologically relevant concentrations of CNTs. The PI and Co-PI will examine how the physicochemical properties (length, metal impurity, surface charge, surface chemical modifications, etc) may induce malignant transformations in cells, look for potential biomarkers, and investigate the role of those biomarkers in induced transformations and tumors. If successful, this approach can provide experimental models and assay methods that reliably predict CNT carcinogenicity, while also establishing specific biomarkers for CNT-induced carcinogenesis. This, in turn will advance both safer-by-design strategies and worker protection issues. Public presentations and summary reports, revealing the fundamental findings from this project in nontechnical terms, will be posted on the West Virginia University, NanoSAFE, and NIOSH websites, while the intended outreach efforts include underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PIs hypothesize that CNT carcinogenicity is dependent on their physicochemical properties and ability to induce malignant transformation of target lung cells through mesothelin (MSLN, a known biomarker for asbestos induced cancer) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-2) dependent mechanisms. To verify this hypothesis, the PIs will break down the investigations into 3 aims: 1) Develop in vitro models to predict CNT carcinogenicity, and determine if the induction of malignant transformation and tumor formation is predictive of in vivo tumorigenic responses; 2) Determine the role of MSLN in CNT-induced transformations and tumors, and elucidate the underlying mechanisms; and 3) Evaluate the use of MSLN and MMP-2 as combination biomarkers to predict CNT carcinogenicity and determine the effect of CNT on MSLN and MMP-2 induction to see if such induction is predictive of in vivo tumorigenic responses. This is an innovative proposal that addresses an important question, the relationship of nanomaterial properties to long-term human disease. Additional strengths include the use of archived reference materials and realistic doses that can be compared to in vivo exposures. In addition, the use of shared particle samples is essential for both replication and for follow-up studies.","coral"

More than 300 scholars have received funding through the program to date, and this award, together with a renewed funding commitment from the ASA, will continue the program for another three years. Proposals submitted to FAD are reviewed by an advisory committee of established scholars; about one quarter of the submitted applications is funded, with a maximum award of $8,000. Funds have been utilized by recipients to train research assistants, and defray the costs of original data collection, data transcription, and travel to archives. Among recent FAD recipients,those receiving awards between 2009 and 2012?more than half published results from their supported project in a scholarly journal or book and 19 percent reported that their work had been cited in popular media. Spread over all recipients during the same period, every dollar spent on FAD awards generated $1.46 in additional funding from other sources; among the approximate one-third of FAD researchers whose awards led directly to additional research support, the average additional return was $4.76.<br/><br/>An important purpose of the FAD program is to encourage successful applications on the part of younger scholars, those employed outside research universities, and researchers who are minorities and women. FAD provides guidance and mentoring to these scholars through a well-developed process, including developmental evaluations by prominent scholars in the discipline and mentoring opportunities. Additional broader impacts of FAD include substantial student training and learning; curriculum modification; building scholarly networks; contributions to sociological infrastructure; and policy impact and media attention.

The research activities have broader impact in three fields: computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning. There is a huge need to develop algorithms to automatically understand the content of images and videos, with numerous potential applications in web searches, image and video archival and retrieval, surveillance applications, robot navigation and others. There are various applications for developing an intelligent system that can use narrative to define and recognize categories.<br/><br/>This project addresses two research questions: First, given a visual corpus and a textual corpus about a specific domain, how to jointly and effectively learn visual concepts? Second, given these two modalities how to facilitate learning novel visual concepts using only pure textual descriptions of novel categories in the domain? The research team approaches the problem on three integrated fronts: Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision. On the learning front, the project investigates and develops algorithms suitable for learning and predicting visual classifiers with side textual information. On the NLP front, the project aims to develop novel methods for learning global and local discriminative category-level attributes and their values from text, with feedback from human computation and visual signal. The project investigates supervised and unsupervised methods for detecting visual text, and learning methods for deep language understanding to build such rich domain models from the noisy visual text. On the Vision front, the project addresses the tasks of detection and classification with side textual information. The project investigates models for the shape and appearance of a general category that can specialize to different subordinates, in a way that allows interpreting information from text within a proper geometric context, and handle variability in viewpoints and articulation.","indigo"

The Himalayan-Tibetan orogen is the classic example of a mountain belt that has formed by continent-continent collision due to the convergence of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Conventional geologic understanding suggest that most of the uplift is occurred during the Cenozoic. In contrast, the principal investigators hypothesize that much of the crustal shortening and thickening recorded by rocks in this area occurred during Late Jurassic to middle Cretaceous time. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will conduct a multidisciplinary investigation that will involve geologic and structural mapping, stratigraphic analysis, geochronologic and and thermochronologic dating. The results of this project will provide new insights in to the understanding of the tectonic evolution of the Pamir region of the Himalayan-Tibetan orogenic belt. In addition to the scientific goals of the research, the project is contributing to the training of graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research in the geosciences, an important STEM discipline. The project will contribute to the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences, which is an important societal outcome. The project will facilitate international collaboration between researchers at U.S., Italy, and Tajikistan, and will build important institutional collaborations between two U.S. universities. The project will include outreach efforts that include lectures and workshops on the Geology of the Pamir for students at the University of Dushanbe in order to promote geoscience education and science literacy in this developing country. The outcomes of the research will be published in peer-reviewed scientific literature and presentations at professional society meetings; isotopic and geochemical data will be archived in web-based community databases.<br/><br/><br/>Over the last decade, increased evidence has shown that much of the crustal shortening and thickening in the Tibetan plateau is Cretaceous in age, pre-dating the Cenozoic collision between India and Asia. However, it is still unclear how laterally extensive, or spatially variable, pre-Cenozoic shortening and thickening is across the entire orogen. This study will provide important information on the timing and magnitude of crustal shortening over a broad region of the western portion of the Tibetan orogen and address important questions regarding the along-strike continuity of pre-Cenozoic deformation in the Tibetan orogen. Further, while significant Cenozoic crustal thickening in the Pamir has been documented in Miocene to Recent gneiss domes, early calculations of the magnitude of upper crustal shortening have been shown to be significantly overestimated, raising important questions regarding the mechanism of Cenozoic crustal thickening (i.e. underthrusting vs. pure shear thickening). The results of this will also provide new information in understanding the mechanisms of crustal thickening in the Pamir region. The specific goal of this study involves testing the hypothesis that much of the crustal shortening and thickening in the Central and Southern Pamir is Mesozoic in age (rather than Cenozoic, as previously interpreted) and represents the along-strike continuation of extensive Late Jurassic-middle Cretaceous crustal shortening and thickening documented in Tibet. The project will include detailed geologic mapping and structural analysis to evaluate crustal shortening in the Pamir; stratigraphic analyses of coarse terrigenous deposits found throughout the region to evaluate whether the deposits are syntectonic with regional shortening structures; geochronologic (detrital U-Pb zircon) and thermochronologic (detrital muscovite 40Ar/39Ar dating, and detrital AFT/AHe double dating) analyses of coarse terrigenous deposits to determine the age of deposition in order to evaluate timing of regional shortening; thermochronologic analyses of basement terranes involved in regional shortening to evaluate timing of shortening related exhumation.","hot_pink"

By comparing the resulting large datasets across family members, the project will clarify how such chemical processes evolved in plants. The interdisciplinary nature of the project requires the participation of experts in biochemistry, genomics, genetics and evolutionary biology. In turn, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students are trained at the frontiers of science by learning cutting edge genomics research that links directly to products of economic value. Through collaboration with the Michigan State University 4H Children's Garden and the Florida Museum of Natural History, the project offers informative displays and tours so the public can become citizen scientists as they learn about the evolution and underlying ""flavor"" chemistry of the familiar and much appreciated mint family. <br/><br/>The Lamiaceae represents a large family of angiosperms with a high degree of chemical diversity. The major subfamilies within the Lamiaceae, the Lamioideae and Nepetoideae, can be readily distinguished morphologically and also show qualitative and quantitative differences in the synthesis of two key specialized compounds, iridoids and volatile monoterpenoids. These compounds play an essential role in plant reproduction, defense, and signaling and are also the source of mint and other herbal flavors for human consumption. This project integrates genomic, metabolite, phylogenetic, and functional datasets to investigate the evolution of the monoterpene and iridoid biosynthetic pathways in the Lamiaceae. In the first phase, the transcriptomes and metabolomes of a phylogenetically diverse panel of 50 species will be generated and analyzed to identify a robust set of 14 species for focused study. In the second phase, full genome sequencing, expression, and metabolite levels will be conducted on the selected set, thus providing resources to (1) identify specific genes involved in monoterpene and iridoid biosynthesis, (2) elucidate key evolutionary events and mechanisms that led to the extant chemical diversity represented in the Lamiaceae, and (3) functionally test hypotheses about how variation in biosynthetic pathway genes contribute to chemical diversity. All resources from the project, including genome, transcriptome sequences and metabolite information will be publicly available through publications, the NCBI sequence archives, the Dryad Digital Repository and posted on a project website hosted at Michigan State University.","teal"

Describing genetic influences on behavior is particularly challenging if genes in social partners interact to generate behavior. Little is known about the extent of such genetic influences, whether their effects vary across populations or the physiological mechanisms that allow the genes in one individual to influence another individual's behavior. Trinidadian guppies are an excellent model system to study these effects on behavior because guppies perform a suite of cooperative antipredator behavior that is strongly influenced by social partners and which varies greatly across populations depending on predation risk. This project uses statistical genetics to describe the relative importance of an individual's own genes and those of its social partners for generating cooperation among guppies. This project will also link variation in physiology, gene expression, and sensory anatomy to variation in cooperation across populations. Undergraduates from under-represented groups will be provided long-term comprehensive research and mentorship experiences. An active learning curriculum for evolution classes will be developed. This work will advance our scientific understanding of the genetics of complex traits, including social behavior, while preparing diverse students to be scientists, educators, and mentors.<br/><br/>How interacting phenotypes, such as cooperation, evolve depends on both the genetic architecture of the behavior and the structure of the social environment. This project will describe the complete genetic architecture of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on guppy antipredator behavior, especially as it might vary with changes in social selection imposed by cooperation under differential predation risk. A quantitative genetic breeding design paired with behavioral experiments will measure the influence imposed by and responsiveness to social partners and genetic covariances between those traits for high and low predation populations. Variation in these traits will be correlated with differences in gene expression for hormone receptors and cognate hormone secretion, pheromone excretion, and somatosensory anatomy. Differences in social environments will be characterized by measuring the proportions of individuals in each population that are influential on and/or responsive to social their partners. Lastly, the combination of influential and responsive partners will be varied to measure how well different combinations cooperate, quantifying differences in social selection across populations. This work will provide some of the first experimental links between proximate mechanisms, variation in IGEs, and social selection. Data will be archived and made publically available through Dryad Digital Repository and GenBank, as appropriate.","teal"

Lakes in glaciated watersheds record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often comprise distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles. These varved sediments are among the most valuable of all natural archives on Earth because they can be placed on a precise time line, and because they accumulate at a rate that is sufficiently high to track environmental variability on annual, and often seasonal, scales. They have been used extensively to reconstruct past climate changes in the Arctic, most often relying on statistical correlations between records from long-term weather stations and varve thickness. These statistical correlations disregard the complex and time-evolving interactions within the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system that link climate to changing properties of sediment deposited at the lake bottom.

Most small discharges occur proximally to a volcanic vent concurrent or within a few minutes of an explosive volcanic eruption. Large scale discharges typically occur throughout a mature plume formed 5 or more minutes subsequent to an explosive eruption. This research work focuses on studying the small, proximal discharges that occur concurrent with explosive volcanic eruptions. The main goal is to better characterize the proximal electrical activity within the context of the eruptive activity to gain a better understanding of the eruptive conditions that are required to produce different types of small-scale discharges. This characterization will be accomplished by making high-resolution 3-D lightning mapping observations of lighting discharges during small explosive eruptions of Sakurajima Volcano located in the Kyushu region of southwestern Japan. Other instrumentation (infrasound, video cameras, and electric field change sensors) will be used to monitor the explosive activity, plume development, and changes in electric field caused by lightning. The data will be used to determine when different types of electrical discharges occur relative to the onset of an explosive eruption and in relation to the ascent of volcanic ejecta. Electrical discharges will be characterized by determining the length scales, speeds, and polarities of the discharges, as well as by locating where the discharges initiate.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: <br/>The research would be the most detailed study of volcanic lightning to date, combining measurements of volcano infrasound, electric field changes, and plume development with high-resolution Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data and high-speed video observations of volcanic lighting.

The research will increase knowledge of electrical activity that occurs as a direct result of an explosive volcanic eruption. This will contribute to our understanding of the eruption processes that are responsible for producing electrical activity proximally to a volcanic vent.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>Because small-scale discharges frequently accompany volcanic eruptions of a large range of sizes, the results of the research will be applicable to developing an eruption monitoring system that utilizes VHF observations of lightning and electrical activity. In addition, the results of the research will be used to determine if one can predict eruption magnitudes or ash plume heights based on observations of electrical activity.

If the mechanisms can be better understood, then the uncertainties associated with making climate predictions on these timescales can be assessed more accurately. Decadal variability over the Pacific is of particular interest in the United States due to its downstream influence over the western United States and its direct influence on climate in Alaska. This project addresses the fundamental question of what are the predictability limits, mechanisms, and regional impacts for decadal modes of the Pacific climate system using a hierarchy of climate models and modern statistical tools. The results of this project will be important in assessing how long-term changes in the environment drive changes in economically important variables such as rainfall, soil moisture, snowfall, temperatures, as well as oceanic temperatures, currents and sea levels, which impacts fisheries, agriculture, and coastal infrastructure along the U.S. West Coast and Asian Marginal Seas. The tools developed in this project should be transferable to other global sectors that also exhibit decadal variability. The project team will mentor graduate students and post-docs, whose educational experiences will include cross-disciplinary exposure to ocean science, atmospheric science, and societal impacts that will be unique in this context. Community outreach will include lectures and educational presentations in public forums, mentoring K-12 students, educating grass-roots climate action organizations, informing the media, and posting research results on web pages.<br/><br/>There is clearly a large gap in our understanding of what controls Pacific decadal climate variability, what limits the predictability of the flows, and what practical skill might be useful in regional impacts on land and in the ocean. The project team proposes a coordinated research effort to better understand the basic physical dynamics of Pacific decadal variability and assess the skill of Pacific decadal predictability, along with its uncertainties and practical value. The research focuses on Community Earth System Model (CESM), with its vast repository of archived runs supplemented with targeted predictability experiments. The analysis focuses on using sophisticated statistical models (Linear Inverse Models) to identify statistical relations among variables, diagnose physical processes, and isolate potentially predictable components of the flows. It also involves using regional coupled atmosphere-ocean, along with uncoupled ocean and atmosphere models, to enhance the understanding of regional response and its potential for practical use in forecasting. The project brings together scientists skilled with developing decadal climate diagnostics, making both statistical and dynamical predictions, and executing regional coupled climate downscaling and regional high-resolution ocean modeling.","lavender"

Archaeology provides a unique time depth for analyzing the processes of population aggregation and dispersal and can prove informative on a range of questions concerning the social implications of village life. How do previously dispersed social groups adjust to cohabitation? How is integration achieved and at what pace does it occur when new groups of people come together to construct new villages and other spatial units? Do certain events or forms of organization foreshadow village depopulation? This research attempts to better understand the negotiations among distinct groups as they begin sharing space. Research focused on architecture has revealed important aspects of cultural systems that shape and are shaped by their physical setting. Migration plays a major role in the world today -- for example in many regions of the developing world people flock from rural regions to reshape and expand cities -- and this proposed study of the past can provide insight into the process as it proceeds on a much expanded scale today.<br/><br/>Dr. E Charles Adams and Samantha Fladd will examine the strategies used by groups to modify their spatial setting and the social implications these choices have on the creation and dissolution of a community. Using excavation records from the 14th century ancestral Hopi villages of the Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster, architectural alterations, such as changing room size, internal features, and doorways, and the use of trash to fill rooms will be located spatially and temporally. Significant reorganization throughout the occupation of the villages and their eventual depopulation resulted in frequent architectural changes and the frequent deposition of cultural materials within rooms. Patterns in the composition and scale of these practices of modification will allow for distinctions to be made among social groups within the villages, as well as allow for the assessment of their relative interactions with one another. Depopulation of these villages was gradual and modifications to space, particularly the filling of rooms, illustrate this process. How these groups and relationships change throughout village occupation can reveal fluctuations in social organization that shed light on the relative success of strategies of integration during different phases of aggregation and dispersal. Detailed models of village aggregation and dissolution, applicable to historic and modern contexts, will be generated and a greater understanding of the history of the Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster will be of interest to scholars and descendant communities. Additionally, this research relies on records from previously excavated sites, furthering the ideals of preservation and stewardship central to archaeology and increasing the accessibility to the excavation documentation. Finally, the framework of this project forefronts the training of students in archaeological research and archival practices.","maroon"

Samples from these pits and cores will be physically and chemically analyzed to address the hypotheses that post-depositional features (e.g., melt features) and elevated concentrations of dry deposited trace species (e.g., black carbon, dust, ammonium) provide new and reliable markers of past El Niï¿½o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and also help facilitate the quantification of the event's intensity. These new markers will be also applied to other ice cores from the southern Andes that exist from extended tropical ice core archives collected over the last forty years.<br/><br/>The chemical and physical fingerprints of past El Niï¿½o events are preserved in ice cores from Andean glaciers, particularly the QIC, and offer the potential to quantify past regional ENSO variability. Previous isotopic (delta 18-Oxygen) records from the QIC provided a long annually resolved history (1,800 years) of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variations. However, delta 18-O on the QIC is also influenced by other internally varying climate system processes (e.g., South American Monsoon, ITCZ position). Consequently, additional El Niï¿½o proxies are needed to reduce the uncertainties inherent in past El Niï¿½o reconstructions and to help facilitate more accurate projections of intensity and frequency.<br/><br/>The new data that could result from the research is aimed at testing two hypotheses: 1) the snow melt and percolation induced by El Niï¿½o is identifiable in the prior year's snow layer and can be calibrated to the El Niï¿½o's strength in terms of temperature and radiative forcing; and 2) the concentration and co-association of biogenic and evaporitic species will be enhanced and detectable deeper in the ice and thereby reveal past El Niï¿½o frequency.<br/><br/>The potential broader impacts include capturing the chemical and physical signatures of a modern El Niï¿½o event in real time that could help evaluate past ENSO variability preserved in ice cores as well as assessing the role of solar forcing in climate.

Although smaller than the Pacific cold tongue, the Atlantic cold tongue is expansive, spanning several degrees latitude across the Equator and tens of degrees longitude. These cold tongues act as sinks for atmospheric heat and are critical to the global heat balance. The seasonal cycle in sea surface temperature varies in magnitude decreasing from east to west along the equator. Peak cooling occurs in boreal summer, first in the east and progressing westward. The Atlantic's cold tongue exerts considerable regional influence on both sides of the ocean, contributing to variable rainfall over Northeast Brazil and to weather patterns in densely populated areas of western Africa. However, measurements in the Atlantic cold tongue comparable to those made in the Pacific cold tongue do not presently exist. This project will close this gap and discern primary differences between the equatorial mixing regimes in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. A post-doctoral associate will participate in a broad analysis of the new observations and be trained in equatorial dynamics. Undergraduate engineering students will be employed in summer months to help with construction and testing of instrumentation. The Mary's Peak webcam will continue to be supported. This is a webcam installed on the roof of the Oceanography building at the Oregon State University that provides a visualization of natural fluid flows traced by clouds, providing an educational glimpse into fluid motions in the atmosphere. This project will also complement ongoing measurements in the Pacific cold tongue, theoretical analyses of Tropical Instability Waves, and ongoing international studies in the tropical Atlantic. The data set will be archived and shared with the community.<br/><br/>Away from the equator, the annual cycle in sea surface temperature (SST) is related to seasonally-varying solar heating. Despite the fact that the equatorial oceans are heated year round by the atmosphere, they also exhibit an annual cycle in SST. Recent, yet distinct, measurements in the equatorial cold tongues of both Pacific and Atlantic Oceans establish the dominant role that mixing plays in boreal summer cooling of the sea surface to produce this annual cycle in SST. At least two significant, and puzzling, differences exist between the two cold tongues. Firstly, measurements from the Atlantic show that the deep diurnal mixing cycle (below the mixed layer but above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent), which is so critical to mixing in the upper equatorial Pacific, is not present in the Atlantic. Secondly, climate models predict a Pacific cold tongue that is too cool and an Atlantic cold tongue that is too warm. The now well-established PIRATA (Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic) array is providing new insight into equatorial Atlantic dynamics and its role in critical weather patterns on both sides of that ocean. This project will use it as the backbone to measure the vertical structure and short-time variability of cold tongue mixing in the Atlantic, for comparison to what has been learned from the Pacific cold tongue. Five newly-developed mixing meters (chi-pods) will each be deployed on two equatorial PIRATA moorings at 10W and 23W across the Atlantic cold tongue for a period of four years. These two moorings have dense upper ocean sampling, surface meteorology, and vertical profiles of ocean currents to complement the mixing measurements. These new observations will establish seasonal and inter-annual variations of cold tongue mixing and how it influences SST and the observed weakening of the Atlantic cold tongue, and also define the mechanisms for differences in Pacific and Atlantic mixing that creates the bipolar climate model responses in SST trends.","lavender"

This project aims to develop the first system model to simulate the full chain of processes that control how weather and climate affect the processes that lead to deposition of a sediment record in lakes in glaciated watersheds. This model provides an alternative approach to previous statistically-based models traditionally used by paleo-climatologists to infer past climate variability from lake sediment records. The new process-based quantitative understanding will lay the groundwork for future studies that will be aimed at recovering records of environmental and climate change that extend back thousands of years. <br/><br/>This project will contribute to ongoing efforts through collaborations with: utility managers of the Municipality of Anchorage who are planning for diminished glacier meltwater input to Eklutna Lake, a major source of their electricity and freshwater and with resource managers at US Fish and Wildlife Service who are developing a monitoring network for the Arctic Refuge and who are striving to foresee future changes in habitat quality associated with glacier retreat. This project will benefit climate science researchers by leading to more accurate climate reconstructions, which will be used as benchmarks for validating global climate model output. Finally, it will support four early-career scientists and will train graduate and undergraduate students in system-science research.<br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop a system model that encodes the major processes that govern the amount and grain size of sediment that accumulates in arctic lakes in glaciated catchments, and to acquire the field-based data for model input and testing. Sediments that accumulate at the bottom of arctic lakes contain a wealth of information about how major features of the surrounding watershed have varied on seasonal to millennial time scales, as well as how they have responded to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Lakes in glaciated watersheds record changes in the melt rate of upstream glaciers, which are among the most dynamic components of the evolving arctic system. The sediment stored in glacier-fed lakes often comprise distinct rhythmic layers that represent annual cycles. These varved sediments are among the most valuable of all natural archives on Earth because they can be placed on a precise time line, and because they accumulate at a rate that is sufficiently high to track environmental variability on annual, and often seasonal, scales. They have been used extensively to reconstruct past climate changes in the Arctic, most often relying on statistical correlations between records from long-term weather stations and varve thickness. These statistical correlations disregard the complex and time-evolving interactions within the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system that link climate to changing properties of sediment deposited at the lake bottom. A more process-based understanding of the interactions that control sedimentation within lakes of glaciated catchments is needed to provide the next generation of paleoclimate reconstructions. By incorporating a system-modeling approach, a process-based system model will be developed to capture dynamic nonlinearities in the glacier-hydrology-lake-sedimentation system. The system model will couple three existing model components: a physically based, spatially explicit hydrological model, which includes a glacier sub-model; an empirically based sediment-flux model; and a process-response, basin-filling sedimentation model. The system model will be applied to three glaciated watersheds that fall along an environmental gradient spanning from the sub-Arctic to the High Arctic, including Lake Linne (Svalbard), Lake Peters (near McCall Glacier, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and Eklutna Lake (near Anchorage, Alaska). This study builds on extensive previous and on-going process studies at or near each of the study sites. Existing data and proposed glacier, hydrology, limnology, and sediment process studies will provide the input data to run the system model and to validate its output.","plum"

More recently the techniques have been applied to arts, social, political and other fields less traditionally reliant on high performance computing. This innovation has grown out of realization some 20 years ago that I/O (input/output) support for high performance parallel and distributed architectures had lagged behind that of pure computational speed, and further that bring I/O up to speed was both critical, and a rather difficult problem. The core hurdle of contemporary I/O on large HPC machines relates to issues of latency in large parts caused by the deficiencies of the historical I/O model that was relevant when computers were exclusively large, centralized, single processor systems shared by many time-sharing programs. In order to improve I/O on scalability on future hardware architectures novel approaches are required.<br/><br/>This project is conducting research on an extension of ParalleX, a new highly innovative parallel execution model. The extension provides a powerful I/O interface that allows researchers to create highly efficient data management, discovery, and analysis codes for Big Data applications. This new extension, known as PXFS, is based on HPX, an implementation of ParalleX based on C++, and OrangeFS, a high performance parallel file system. The research goal driving PXFS is to extend HPX objects into I/O space so that the objects become persistent and storage becomes another class of memory, all accessed as a single virtual address space and managed by an event driven dynamic adaptive computation environment. Critical aspects of this approach include futures-based synchronization, dynamic locality management, dynamic resource management, hierarchical name space, and an active global address space (AGAS). The overall goals of PXFS are to eliminate the division of programming imposed by conventional file system through the unification of name spaces and their management, and to minimize global synchronization in order to support asynchronous concurrency. The research methodology is to implement a Map/Reduce application framework using PXFS and evaluate its effectiveness in both performance and ease of use.<br/><br/>This project is conducted at three major research universities involving undergraduate and graduate students, post-docs, and high-school teachers and their students. The project includes a PI from the functional genomics field acting as domain science expert in order to focus the development efforts on real world problems. Graduate students and post-docs involved in the project are trained in these areas to promote scientists who understanding both aspects of Big Data problems. The project engages under represented minorities with the goal to inspire them to pursue a career in computer science or genomics.

This general class of system arises in many applications of interest to society, including water infiltration from the Earth's surface, carbon sequestration, gas production from hydraulically fractured wells, petroleum recovery, land-atmosphere interaction, engineered treatment processes, and a wide range of biomedical applications (e.g. tumor growth, dermal transport, etc.). Our scientific understanding of porous medium systems is embodied in mechanistic mathematical models, which are used to evaluate such porous medium systems, make predictions, guide engineering design, and to inform policy decisions. Because the length of many porous medium systems is much greater than the natural length scale of the solid phase, the mathematical models intended to represent such systems are typically posed at a scale that neglects many aspects of the physical processes known to influence flow in such systems. While the physics are relatively well understood at the small scale, there has not existed a rigorous connection between the small, well-understood scale and the larger scale where problems must be solved. Recently, a theory has been developed that connects these two length scales and yields models that have the promise to be more physically realistic and accurate than the standard models used in practice. This research will reduce these new theoretical models to completely solvable forms, evaluate specific aspects of these models, and validate the models for a range of systems. Both small scale experiments and high-resolution modeling will be a used to accomplish these objectives. The results will be of widespread benefit to society because of the broad applicability of this class of problem, and the work will involve graduate students recruited from a pool that is rich in under-represented fractions of the population working in scientific research. <br/><br/>Many critical problems in hydrology involve two-fluid-phase flow in porous medium systems. The proposed work will connect well-understood microscale processes with macroscale models using the thermodynamically constrained averaging theory (TCAT) that will yield closed, solved models that are evaluated and validated. Microfluidic experiments, and high resolution lattice Boltzmann simulations will be used to provide the fine scale detail needed to construct specific forms of closure relationships and support a thorough evaluation and validation of this new class of model. Computational and experimental methods and results will also be produced that will be of value independent of the theoretical manner in which macroscale systems are modeled. This work will have a significant set of broader impacts. The models developed are hydrologically motivated but have applicability far beyond hydrology. We will nurture and grow our set of collaborators that apply TCAT-based models for applications such as tumor growth, the effects of diabetes on extremal tissue, and engineered systems such as ultrafiltration membranes. The lattice-Boltzmann methods developed will be applicable to a wide range of systems beyond the hydrologic systems of focus in this work. A second edition of a book describing the theoretical advances will be produced to disseminate the findings of this work. Additional impacts include: (1) contributions to education through course content, student research, and science outreach; (2) participation of underrepresented researchers and linkages to minority recruitment programs; (3) broad dissemination of findings in hydrology, physics, engineering, and applied mathematics journals; and (4) digital archiving and dissemination of unique data sets and video images of experiments and high-resolution simulations.","hot_pink"

The commemoration of shared heritage through the maintenance of traditional rituals and material culture is often an important means for communities ? both past and present - to maintain integration and identity. Nevertheless, most approaches to sustainability in the past focus on environmental and demographic factors while placing little emphasis on considerations of community commemoration and cooperation. By focusing on the material realities of community life over long time frames, archaeology is especially poised to build comprehensive accounts of sustainability that consider how the challenges of social integration and environmental adaptation are entangled. How do communities adapt their traditions and maintain solidarity as they undergo major transformations in subsistence practices and political economy? How can people deploy old practices to make new forms of social organization possible? By investigating what contributed to community sustainability in the past, social scientists can better address parallel challenges in the present. In particular, this research can inform strategies of heritage maintenance among indigenous or other marginalized communities undergoing economic transformations that threaten their ways of life and continued existence. <br/><br/><br/>Mr. Lash and his research team will investigate how members of a small island community adapted the monuments and practices of a ritual tradition as the community underwent major transformations in agriculture, political economy, and demographics in the 18th to 20th centuries. Previous scholarship suggests that ritual practices can foster shared heritage and identity by maintaining monuments from the past as places of collective access and commemoration. From c. 1750-1960, islanders on Inishark in western Ireland visited a series of monuments as part of annual ritual processions dedicated to St Leo. Scattered around islanders? houses and field plots, these monuments were remnants of a monastery abandoned centuries earlier. To assess the impact of this ritual tradition on community sustainability, research will trace how the use, abandonment, renovation, and destruction of ritual monuments corresponds across time with transitions in village agriculture, landholding, and demographics. Combining oral history, archival documents, and excavation of four monuments will reconstruct the changing practices and spatial dynamics of the ritual tradition. Results will test common assumptions about the capacity of heritage maintenance to support political economic formations by structuring community members? movements and commemorations. A research team of American, Irish, and local collaborators will generate a dataset that will enhance archaeological analyses of sustainability and inform local initiatives that incorporate archaeological heritage as a key cultural and economic resource.","maroon"

It may regulate the cooling of the giant planets, help sustain Jupiter's Giant Red Spot, and provide energy for smaller storms. Areas of lightning indicate where moist convection is occurring, so the researchers will begin by combining images of the lightning storms on Saturn and Jupiter, taken by a variety of Cassini spacecraft instruments at different wavelengths. They will also focus on giant lightning storms on Saturn that occurred during the years 2010-2011. They will also model the atmospheric dynamics in order to better understand the multi-decadal intervals between Saturn's storms, the role of convection in Jupiter's and Saturn's cooling, and the deep water abundance, and the mechanisms for producing zonal jets. The result will be a 3-D picture of the distribution, composition, and motion of the clouds and their relation to convection and lightning. They will incorporate their research into university courses, and train a graduate student, and will make publicly available the GiantPlanetWRF modeling tool for modeling the full time-dependent dynamics of the planetary interior.<br/><br/>The project has two main components: (1) Characterize lightning by analyzing archival data on both Jupiter and Saturn from the Cassini imaging system.

(2) Simulate the dynamics of moist convection with a state-of-the-art model. The proposing team will modify the existing Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to simulate the deep sub-cloud layer of giant planet atmospheres.

The goal of IWBDA is to make biology more easily, robustly, reliably, and predictably engineered and therefore, tackle challenges in biology and medicine, leading to advances in disease diagnosis, treatment and prevention. <br/><br/>Existing synthetic biology conferences and meetings do not explicitly focus on bridging the gap between the work of experimentalists and computational researchers. Bridging this divide is essential for the field of synthetic biology to fulfill its promise. Furthermore, other venues do not actively include the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) community, which can bring a wide range of experiences, expertise, and perspectives to the design of novel biological systems. IWBDA includes keynote and invited talks, tutorials, poster sessions, panel discussions, as well as dedicated time for informal discussions. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this workshop is a key strength. This workshop will provide a venue for between twelve and fifteen technical talks over two days. These talks are chosen from two page extended abstracts which are later archived. In addition, there will be two invited lectures, ten to twenty posters, multiple group discussion sessions, and a featured student programming competition (BDAthlon). Technical topics will be diverse and include areas such as: Parts and Standardization, Biological Circuit Simulators, Biological Circuit Design, CAD Tools for Synthetic Biology and Gene Network Reconstruction. No other such workshop exists in Synthetic Biology/EDA.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impacts of IWBDA are numerous. A wide variety of researchers (120+) from EDA and synthetic biology will be brought together in a unique context which does not exist elsewhere. IWBDA will capture and make public the slides, posters, and abstracts from the session. In addition, a user survey will be created to learn more about how workshops like this can better serve the community. Finally, there will be numerous undergraduate, graduate and post graduate student researchers in attendance. IWBDA encourages and supports woman and underrepresented minority student participation and has a diverse technical program and executive committees.<br/><br/>In keeping with its goal of establishing international collaborations and research efforts, IWBDA 2016 will take place at Newcastle University in England. The co-general chairs are Prof. Anil Wipat from Newcastle and Prof. Pietro Lio' from Cambridge. The program chair is Prof. Chris French from the University of Edinburgh. A keynote speaker is Prof. Natalio Krasnogor from Newcastle University.

A key enabler of any engineering solution for the above is deployment of (low cost) hardware in conjunction with appropriate networking and storage resources and a software infrastructure that allows for persistent monitoring of spectrum usage. This pilot project will produce the first calibrated large-scale data sets (over frequency, time and region) of spectrum usage archived for post-processing.

Drug screening programs in the 1950s tested single compounds on multiple cancers in heterogeneous patient samples. Yet in the decades that followed the first chemotherapy trials, researchers turned to studies of narrow subcategories of cancer (e.g. metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women) to test complex therapies involving surgery, radiotherapy and drug combinations. The shift between these research designs, that are practically mirror images of one another, poses puzzling questions: How has cancer research shifted its structure and orientation? How and when did 'cancer' stop being a meaningful clinical unit? How did multiple cancer diagnoses emerge and come to replace it?<br/><br/>This project examines the structuring of cancer research to explain the multiplication of cancer diagnoses. The researchers hypothesize that the effort to improve anticancer drugs through clinical trials was a mechanism for creating new diagnoses. The introduction of statistical expertise pressured cancer scientists to homogenize patient samples so that they could compare treatment and control groups that were as similar as possible. This compelled researchers to narrow down trials' recruitment criteria and to transform diagnostic schemes. The study examines whether prognostic variables used in clinical trials to predict patients' responses to treatment turned into refined recruitment criteria in subsequent trials and were eventually translated into new diagnoses. The increasing specification of diagnosis limited patient pools and slowed down the recruitment of patients that met inclusion criteria. The researchers thus also hypothesize that diagnosis specification increased the collaboration between institutions that could recruit patients, reinforced the need for standardization and sophisticated statistical tools, allowing researchers to conduct multicenter trials and to work with small patient samples, and reinforced specialization in oncology. The researchers conduct comprehensive archival research and analyze materials from all major institutions involved in cancer research: The National Cancer Institute, The Food and Drug Administration, Medicare, Cooperative Research Groups from across the U.S, The U.S. National Library of Medicine and The Mary Lasker Paper Collection.<br/><br/>This project offers an important contribution both to sociology of diagnosis and to sociology of standardization and evidence-based-medicine. Sociology of diagnosis asks how are new diagnoses created. The researchers suggest a novel mechanism that drives the creation of diagnoses. That is, medical drugs create opportunities and incentives to develop new diagnoses not only through pharmaceutical marketing and through medicalization of previously non-medical conditions, but also that drugs function to extract data that serve to split up patient populations and existing diagnoses. Sociology of evidence-based-medicine asks how clinical trials became the 'gold standard' of biomedicine. This project suggests that the endogenous effects of clinical trials acted to reinforce trials' golden status by fragmenting diagnosis clinical trials restructured cancer research and reinforced the need for standardization and statistical expertise. This study also offers a critical contribution to the understanding of how scientific procedures (homogenization) interact with exclusion and with disparities in the production of medical knowledge about different population groups.","crimson"

The American Southwest (here defined as Arizona, southern Utah, and southern Nevada) appears to be mostly inactive tectonically. However, there is evidence that large earthquakes have occurred here in recent geologic times. We explore the possibility that the amount of crustal deformation in this area (and thus can generate (large) earthquakes) varies with time and is modulated by large earthquakes in southern California and Gulf of California. We have seen evidence for this by using GPS observations of the deformation pattern before and after the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake (M7.2). We will combine ongoing GPS measurements with different modeling tools to characterize and model the source of the time-variable and long-term deformation, which we aim to separate. The time-variable deformation can be understood as visco-elastic deformation in the lithosphere following large (far-field) earthquakes. The long-term deformation can likely be modeled by considering the proper ratio of the far-field stresses imposed by Pacific plate motion and stresses due to lateral variation in crustal thickness and density in our study area. <br/><br/>This is a follow-on proposal that extends our current EarthScope project on the Colorado Plateau area. Over the last five years, the long-term kinematics as measured by GPS are obscured by postseismic deformation from the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, which occurred 3 months before we installed a new 34-station continuous network. As a result, important questions on the role of Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) variations in driving deformation, the reasons for the dearth of active faults and seismicity in southern Arizona, and the reach of plate motion stresses remain unanswered. In order to address these questions, and simultaneously further our understanding of the postseismic process, we propose a three-tiered approach: 1) extend existing GPS time-series to improve characterization of transient deformation, 2) use those data to explore the crustal and mantle viscosities required to match the GPS time-series data, and 3) create physical models of the long-term expected deformation, that includes the latest GPE estimates, to explain the residual motions after correction for postseismic effects. We will also leverage GPS data from other NSF funded projects, as well as seismic data products obtained by USArray that have helped to constrain crustal and lithospheric thickness structure and stress orientations. Geodetic strain rates could potentially be used as an independent constraint on the regional seismic hazard, but only after we have corrected it for all post-seismic effects, and assessed the long-term drivers of crustal motion. We will employ a female graduate student at UNR to work on the project. We will also engage a RESESS undergraduate intern during the summer of the second year. The goal of the RESESS program is to increase diversity in the Geosciences work force. We will recruit one student from the UA Disability Resource Center (DRC) to conduct a small research project associated with the larger goals of the overall project. We will also lead an accessible field trip to the Grand Canyon for students registered at the DRC in a program that we developed and implemented in September 2015. The goal of these activities is to draw attention to the numerous research opportunities made available by the large volume of data in NSF and other national data archives, available to a wide range of individuals. Finally, we plan to give outreach talks at the area's parks and monuments.","hot_pink"

Because the institutional state may be distant from these territories, claims to sovereignty and the right to exert regulatory power often get worked out locally. These evolving relationships raise important questions about the nature of government in the contemporary world and the capacities of communities to establish and evaluate political legitimacy. The research funded by this award addresses these questions by taking advantage of an interesting natural experiment in a coal-mining region in northeastern Colombia. <br/><br/>Vanderbilt University doctoral student Emma Banks, under the supervision of Dr. Lesley Gill, will undertake the research in a frontier region of Colombia that, for over two decades, has been home to a major open pit coalmine. The mine has displaced communities from their communal rural territories and resettled them in peri-urban villages. Usefully for research purposes, these communities contrast with each other along two significant axes: how recently they have been displaced and whether they are ethnically Afro-descendant or indigenous Indians. Taking advantage of these contrasts, Banks will gather data in four communities that contrast along those lines: two communities resettled earlier, one of each ethnicity; and two resettled more recently, again, once of each ethnicity. This will allow her to see how local political processes evolve over time and how this evolution is affected by the resources accessible by people in different social positions. Banks will compare the legal resources, ethnic identity politics, and alliance networks used by each community to legitimize authority, make the impacts of resettlement visible, and influence resettlement outcomes. To find and compare evidence of legitimacy building, she will conduct participant observation at roundtable meetings between the mine and communities, and interview mine officials, state officials, and community members. To contextualize these findings, she will also carry out archival research and conduct in-depth life history interviews with community members. These data will allow her to better understand a phenomenon found worldwide, including in the United States: how communities and natural resource corporations, away from the direct government control, negotiate legitimacy and influence each other. Findings from this research will inform social science theory of how local politics functions at the local level in the contemporary world. Findings will also be of use to policy makers who seek to devise ways to support resource extraction without disadvantaging citizens and communities.","maroon"

Beyond efficiency issues, a gap has also been developing between handwritten systems and digital results. This team seeks to close that gap and create a seamless digital environment containing all pertinent experimental information and analytics. A digital mergence allows scientists to quickly access research archives and avoids hours of manual searching through notebook stacks. Billions of dollars are wasted on resources, time, and organization required for paper lab notebook maintenance. The proposed system, Labii ELN, creates a digital environment to organize and simplify research. <br/><br/>This team will take a one of a kind approach and utilize protocol templates for ceasing all repetitive behaviors, templating them the first time for easy reuse. The proposed technology will allow users to create protocol templates (root) followed by branched experimental documents (nodes), which are composed of variable fields that are altered during experimentation. This means less information is worked with and requires inputting. The connection between roots and nodes allows for novel features like Summary Analysis. The team's current commercialization plan will start with targeting wet lab researchers. On the academic side, the team will start with Universities in the bay area (Stanford University, UC Berkeley,UCSF). In industry, the team will target small and medium size biomedical and pharmaceutical companies. Once beta testing is completed and the team has added features recommended by customers, this I-Corps will seek nationwide adoption.","tan"

Females breeding in more competitive environments tend to transfer more testosterone to their offspring prenatally, which permanently makes offspring more aggressive. This maternal effect may help offspring adapt to competitive environments, yet it is still unclear how maternally derived testosterone permanently impacts offspring behavior. Without knowing how it happens, it is difficult to characterize the heritability of this maternal effect and how it fits into larger evolutionary frameworks. This research is among the first to test if molecular mechanisms, such as changes in gene expression and control, mediate the effects of maternal testosterone on offspring aggression using birds, in which this maternal effect is best studied. This research will take a novel approach by exploring differences in aggression-related genes from several brain pathways. The results of this research will help clarify what contributes to long-lasting variation in aggressive behaviors and why differences in animal behaviors exist. The researchers will also train undergraduate students in laboratory methods and bioinformatics. Additionally, this research has lent itself to a citizen science project with songbird breeders throughout the United States to explore factors influencing avian reproduction. <br/><br/>Specifically, the researchers will experimentally determine if an epigenetic mechanism (i.e., DNA methylation) underlies the programming of offspring aggression by maternal hormones in songbirds. Birds are excellent models for maternal effects because their young develop externally in eggs and females allocate substantial amounts of testosterone to their egg yolks. The researchers will inject zebra finch eggs with a control vehicle or testosterone and measure aggressive and competitive behaviors (i.e., growth rate and begging rate) in the resulting offspring. In a subset of these offspring, the researchers will test for evidence of epigenetic programming. Aggressive behaviors are initiated across many interacting genes (i.e., steroid receptors, histamine, dopamine, somatostatin, arginine vasotocin, etc.). Thus, the researchers will use RNA-seq and methyl-seq analyses to explore genome-wide differences in mRNA expression and site-specific methylation patterns of aggression-related genes in two socially-relevant brain regions, the telencephalon and diencephalon. This research will greatly expand our knowledge of how different gene networks interact across brain regions to express aggression and will provide one of the first avian DNA methylomes. All data generated in this project will be archived in appropriate electronic repositories.","teal"

The purpose is to explore efficiencies in the management of these arrays and optimize resources by designing a shared framework for integrated data storage, archiving, dissemination, and high-level data products. Since these independent arrays observe different portions of Earth's space environment (Earth-space), their further development and integration has potential for providing a powerful tool for synthesizing information about its global dynamics. The planned shared framework will be separate from the scientific research, proposed and performed by individual investigator teams, and thus will provide much needed continuity for funding the instrumentation and data distribution during lapses in individual research funding. The effects of these interruptions are compounded because observations from these magnetometer arrays are used by the broader research community and in international collaborations, in addition to their use in scientific research by the magnetometer teams, themselves. Efficiencies in the operation and maintenance of ground-based magnetometer arrays as well as in the development of new global high-level data products will strengthen and improve a valuable U.S. infrastructure for exploring Earth-space and understanding its long-term evolution. <br/><br/>Ground-based magnetometers make use of signatures in the Earth's magnetic field to explore and understand Earth-space. These signatures provide information about ionospheric currents associated with geomagnetic storms and substorms, the magnetosphere's response to interplanetary shocks, the reconfiguration of currents and convection as the solar wind driving changes, and the propagation of energy through Earth-space carried by long-period plasma waves. They provide the longest record of Earth-space observations and thus are key to our understanding of long-term variations in that environment. Magnetometer arrays are supported and maintained by countries all over the world so the US arrays contribute valuable information to synthesizing an understanding of the global dynamics in Earth-space. Efficiencies in operations and maintenance of these arrays are important to enable the continuing support and further development of this valuable national observing capability.","fuchsia"

Further, the design will constitute the first step towards future networked monitoring infrastructure that can allow for distributed experimentation by researchers who will have the ability to task desired sensor sub-sets simultaneously for data acquisition in desired spectrum bands.

Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences. VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors. First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2016. The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community. Special efforts have been made by the organizers to achieve diversity among the students across institutions, and to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities. <br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the first three such events, which were also supported by NSF. The event will begin with a dinner on Saturday, March 19, immediately prior to the start of the IEEE 3DUI Symposium, to welcome the students and provide initial mentorship and tips for networking at the conference. The main activities will take place on Sunday, March 20, in parallel with the second day of IEEE 3DUI. The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results. A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years. Each student will also be asked to prepare a poster on his/her research that will be on display during the conference as part of the poster sessions, and to submit a short (2-page) abstract to be archived in the IEEE Digital Library. The VR conference will begin that evening, with a welcome reception where Doctoral Consortium participants will network with what they have learned over the first two days. Additional smaller activities will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week; in particular, small groups of 2-3 students will meet for mentoring lunches and/or other networking events with senior members of the VR/3DUI community.","indigo"

When image data size is no longer a restricting factor, new domains of study become possible relating the micro-scale to macro-scale, such as understanding the neural connectomics of the visual cortex. By removing the barrier of time, effort, and expertise to use large imagery, VisStore will enable scientists to scale their existing workflows. Such capability would open new investigations into fundamental biological processes, the origin and progression of diseases, and ultimately the drugs and procedures for curing them. Although initially tailored to life sciences applications, VisStore can be integrated in microscopy for new devices and emerging disciplines, such as precision medicine, material sciences and semiconductors. Furthermore, VisStore has the potential to ease the transition from current workflows to fully online cloud-based ones. Furthermore, VisStore and the hierarchical streaming infrastructure have the potential to become the de-facto standard for large volumetric images.<br/><br/>This Accelerating Innovation Technology Translation project will support R&D to build a prototype of VisStore, a plug-and-play device for easy storing, archiving, accessing, distributing, and processing massive volumetric images coming from microscopy or medical devices. It translates research discovery toward commercial applications in the microscopy market which continues to grow, topping $4.1 billion in 2014 with an anticipated CAGR growth of 7.1%, while the addressed cyber-infrastructures to reliably store, easily access, and efficiently process such data have not kept pace. This has led to a discrepancy between the quality of data that could be produced, and what actually is used, as scientists unnecessarily restrict image sizes to match computational capabilities. Brute force solutions for scaling to massive images are expensive, difficult to maintain, and require expertise usually out of reach for smaller institutions. VisStore is a combined software/hardware/cloud solution that enables ease of use for image data of any size. No more complicated than a USB drive, VisStore allows users to easily access, process, and distribute giga and terapixel 2D and 3D images within a workgroup, a company, or even globally distributed environments.<br/><br/>The technology behind VisStore enhances the state-of-the-art for handing massive image volumes. Modern software tools often stop scaling when data size exceeds main memory, and this has been a limiting factor for microscopy imagery. When dealing with image data, the hierarchical streaming software infrastructure implemented in VisStore essentially extends the memory hierarchy of a workstation to both an external network-attached hard drive (NAS), and even cloud-based storage. With each component acting as a cache, VisStore achieves performance through on-demand data access to proprietary file layout that minimizes the amount of data transferred between levels, enabling efficient scaling to images of any size. This will support development for: (i) automated ingestion and conversion of images coming from microscopy or medical devices; (ii) a simple user interface and tool to manage local and remote storage of data; and (iii) a tool to select and export data for integration with existing workflows.<br/><br/>The project engages the Moran Eye Center, the Associated Regional and University Pathologists, Inc. (ARUP) laboratories and the Oregon Health & Science University to develop and tests a prototype acquiring giga- and teravoxel images and test its commercial value to translate this technology from research discovery towards a commercial reality. In particular, the graduate and undergraduate students supported by the project will be directly involved in these entrepreneurial activities. They will cooperate directly with the early adopters of the technology at the collaborating institutions and receive hands-on experience in how to identify and resolve their pain points and ultimately translate the raw technology into a product with commercial value.","tan"

This is important to understand the disk development into planetary systems. The researchers combine near-infrared FLAMINGOS spectroscopy and photometry to study the stellar populations for a sample of eight young (about 1-2 million years old) embedded clusters in the molecular clouds Perseus, Orion A, Orion B and Mon OB1 with archival mid-IR Spitzer photometry. The sample of clusters covers a range of sizes, stellar populations, stellar densities and morphologies. The spectroscopic data provide extinction, stellar spectral types, median ages, age spreads, stellar masses and distribution of stars within each cluster. The derived extinction is combined with Spitzer mid-infrared photometry to obtain the intrinsic infrared excess for the sources, which is an indicator for distinguishing sources with disks and envelopes, sources with optically thick disks, sources with optically thin anemic disks, and diskless sources. The disks lifetimes might depend on both stellar mass and cluster environment and the goals here are to assess the dependence of fraction of stars with discs on stellar mass, and to evaluate the dependence of disks fraction on cluster environments such as cluster stellar density, stellar population, morphology, and median ages.

These genome sequences have great potential to increase agricultural productivity and provide a foundation for modern, genome-based research. Unfortunately a genome sequence in-and-of itself is of little use unless the locations of the genes within it are identified and their parts properly mapped. The process of locating and mapping the structures of genes within a genome sequence is called genome annotation. Researchers are finding that plant genomes are difficult to annotate for several technical reasons; for example, plant genomes tend to be repeat rich and are often polyploid. The purpose of this project is to adapt and extend MAKER, an established annotation tool, for use on plant genomes. Doing so will help to unlock the potential of sequenced plant genomes to empower genomics- based plant research. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to produce a plant genome optimized annotation pipeline that can be widely used by the plant research community and will be incorporated as part of the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure. The project will also provide outreach to the plant genomics community by means of tutorials given at various scientific meetings in genome annotation on how to use the MAKER-based plant genome optimized annotation tool. These tutorials will allow smaller plant genome projects to annotate their genomes and to distribute the resulting gene models; in turn, this will enable downstream comparative and functional genomics studies by third parties. Source code will be freely available and distributed in publicly announced releases at http://www.yandell-lab.org. Stable versions will be available by anonymous FTP and HTTP as software archives (*.tar.gz files). Finally, developer and candidate releases will be managed via subversion repositories.

New strength and stiffness enhanced unibody framing systems and low-cost seismic isolation systems will be investigated to achieve cost-efficient resistance to earthquakes. In contrast to conventional seismic design practice, where large structural ductility demands can result in extensive damage to architectural and mechanical building systems, the considered systems will achieve reduced deformations and damage by integrating structural and architectural building components in a lateral system with high strength and stiffness. High-fidelity simulation models will be implemented to accurately assess the seismic performance, including models for seismic isolation and the unibody space-frame systems. Physical and computational simulations will provide the basis for new seismic design criteria for light-frame residential construction to meet appropriate collapse safety goals and incorporate life-cycle concepts to control damage and loss of building function. The research is organized around an integrated plan of quasi-static testing, shake table testing, and computational simulations of structural fasteners, subassemblies, and systems. The research team from Stanford University and California State University, Sacramento, will use the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Diego. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse data repository at http://www.nees.org.<br/><br/>Much in the same way that automotive construction advanced from ""body-on-frame"" to ""unibody"" construction in the 1970's, this research has the promise to help revolutionize light-frame residential construction by integrating structural and architectural components into a unibody building system. When combined with seismic base isolation, the resulting integrated system will substantially reduce the damage and repairs due to earthquakes. Building owners, communities, and other stakeholders will benefit by the economies achieved through optimized design approaches and integrated building systems. By reducing earthquake damage, the new framing systems have the potential to dramatically improve the resilience of communities by allowing residents to ""shelter-in-place"" and quickly recover from large earthquakes. The project has a natural educational component through the research participation of graduate and undergraduate students and strong participation of industry through an advisory group to promote technology transfer to building codes and professional practice.

Since 1983, annual growth and survival have been measured for diverse canopy tree species in a lowland tropical rainforest at La Selva, Costa Rica. A major discovery revealed by these unique long-term records is that tropical rainforest tree growth has been slowed by very small increases in yearly temperatures. This five-year project renewal, which will bring the total period spanned by the La Selva measurements to 33 years, will greatly increase scientific understanding of the impacts of warming and of other potentially changing climatic factors on tropical rainforest trees.<br/><br/>This study is the longest investigation of annual tropical rainforest performance worldwide. Unprecedented high temperatures are projected to affect all tropical regions in coming years. This study will make it possible to measure directly how tropical trees are responding to these changing conditions. This project has significant societal relevance, as productivity declines by these carbon-rich forests could translate into large carbon-dioxide emissions from the world tropics, thus accelerating global warming.

Individual animals can shift their respiratory strategies in real time, just as humans increase the concentration and size of red blood cells during high-altitude training. Alternatively, high-altitude populations can genetically adapt by natural selection over generations, effectively optimizing their respiratory systems for low ambient oxygen pressure. This project will characterize the high-altitude respiratory strategies of dozens of wild bird species. Study taxa comprise pairs of related high-altitude and low-altitude populations at different levels of evolutionary divergence. International teams will sample birds along elevational gradients in the Andes to evaluate the structure and performance of critical respiratory system components, including heart, lungs, blood, hemoglobin, and the hypoxia-induced gene-expression cascade. With these data, this project will (1) develop a model of the time-course of high-altitude adaptation and (2) describe the diversity of solutions to this common physiological challenge.

The first program is a 2012 Conference on Laboratory Instruction Beyond the First Year of College (the BFY Conference), aimed at broad curricular impact. The second program is the ALPhA Immersions Program, focused on faculty-staff development, with sites distributed around the country. Each initiative is in response to and plans to feed back into national surveys.<br/><br/>The BFY Conference initiates these programs by offering opportunities for hands-on exposure to a broad smï¿½rgï¿½sbord of contemporary instructional labs appropriate to Modern Physics, Electronics, Optics, Advanced Labs, as well as key instructional labs in Statistical Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Mechanics, etc. These focused-topic portions of the program are designed to lead into discussion of supporting curricular models that improve the degree of cohesion and integration of the 4-year laboratory curriculum. <br/><br/>Some of the most productive exchanges about modernizing curricular content, structure, and pedagogy emerge when the conversation is focused at the level of discussing particular courses or even particular experiments. So, each site of the ALPhA Immersions Program is offering focused faculty-staff development coupled with larger curricular discussions, and initial results demonstrate that this program will be an extraordinarily effective agent for curricular change. Each participant is immersed for three days in the details of a single, key instructional BFY laboratory topic of their choice. A month before arrival, each participant will be given preparatory reading and assignments, and after the program they will have access to (and be prompted for) follow-up support. Experts mentor the participants throughout the process, ensuring that participants can confidently update their curricula.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: By disseminating 4-year models of instruction regarding interconnected topics such as single-photon interference, indistinguishability, entanglement, quantum correlations, and Bell's inequalities, the intellectual landscape of undergraduate physics laboratories is being dramatically modernized. In addition to disseminating contemporary curricular models, pedagogies, curricular content, and experimental techniques, this project promotes shared adoption of assessment tools, particularly emphasizing ones dealing with student conceptual understanding of quantum mechanics. All material is made accessible through the AAPT/ComPADRE archival website for laboratory materials. This project thereby addresses the relative stagnation of laboratory curricula that our survey data suggest exists in many programs throughout the nation. <br/><br/>Broader Impact: An initial national survey regarding BFY laboratory instruction has been conducted, highlighting clear, common shortcomings among undergraduate physics programs. It makes a strong case that shared opportunities for faculty, staff, and curricular development in this area are especially important, particularly for the surprisingly large number of institutions where the relevant instructors must develop this portion of the curriculum in relative isolation. Critically, the initial survey results make clear that impact can be achieved by improving the professional qualifications and effectiveness of an identifiable and relatively small cohort of persons who collectively play a crucial role in the experimental instruction of nearly all students who major or minor in physics. The two programs described here can collectively impact a significant number of these instructors, and special efforts are being made to include those serving historically underrepresented groups.","cyan"

Ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) resolve stirring on scales larger than ~30 km, and regional models on scales ~1 km, but isopycnal (lateral) stirring by submesoscale (1 to 10 km) and finescale (10 m to 1 km) processes must be parameterized. Tracer-release experiments consistently find isopycnal diffusivities at scales of 1-10 km to be an order of magnitude larger than predictions for internal-wave shear dispersion. This project will provide a more complete and accurate assessment of the roles of internal waves and vortical mode in lateral stirring at the submesoscale of order 10 m to 10 km), and the cascade of energy to dissipative vertical scales, to resolve this paradox. Internal waves and vortical mode are difficult to distinguish observationally. However, judicious use of a numerical model can tease apart their influences by isolating different physics. A major advantage of the approach of this project is that all of the above processes/dynamics can be explored in the context of a single model, allowing us to seamlessly explore the internal-wave cascade and lateral dispersion by the different mechanisms across a wide range of parameter regimes and forcing conditions. The proposed simulations will elucidate the underlying physics and inform our understanding of how these processes work in the ocean so as to provide an order-one parameterization of submesoscale isopycnal diffusivities for OGCMs. Parameterizations developed in this study will be made available through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Two graduate students will be trained in high resolution numerical modeling and data analysis techniques. A public project website will also be maintained, with initial conditions and parameters for our simulations archived and shared on request with other investigators interested in collaboration.<br/><br/>The proposed approach will use a Boussinesq pseudo-spectral model to investigate lateral dispersion and the internal-wave energy cascade. Specific goals are to determine the roles of (1) wave/wave and wave/vortex interactions in the internal-wave cascade to small vertical scales and turbulence production, (2) wave/wave and wave/vortex de-phasing of the internal wave field in isopycnal stirring, (3) turbulent intermittency in internal-wave shear dispersion, and (4) vortical-mode shear dispersion and stirring. Model results will also be used to examine (5) the physics of the finescale roll-off and (6) the statistics of unstable shear events (Richardson number less than a quarter). Simulations with and without finescale potential vorticity production by internal-wave breaking will be used to isolate the roles of the vortical-mode inverse cascade. Passive tracers subject to diapycnal mixing and non-diffusive Lagrangian particles will be used to distinguish between shear dispersion and stirring. The simulations will be run with varying buoyancy frequency, Coriolis frequency, internal-wave spectral energy level and frequency spectral shapes to explore fundamental parameter dependences of the cascade, finescale roll-off, Richardson Number statistics, diapycnal diffusion and isopycnal diffusion. First-order submesoscale horizontal diffusivities for OGCMs and regional models will result. Different forcings (surface wind, tidal) for maintaining the internal-wave field in a statistically steady state will be tested. Profiling float and dye data collected in the Sargasso Sea during summer will be used to guide model initialization and assess the realism of the results. Where possible, differences in modelled dispersion characteristics will be identified and used to identify stirring mechanisms in the observational data sets.","lavender"

This award will measure a proxy for oxidant concentrations in a West Antarctic ice core over several major climate transitions over the past 50,000 years. These measurements will complement similar measurements from a Greenland ice core, which showed significant changes in atmospheric oxidants over major climate transitions covering this same time period. The addition of measurements from Antarctica will allow researchers to examine if the oxidant changes suggested by the Greenland ice core record are regional or global in scale. Knowledge of how oxidants vary naturally with climate will better inform predictions of the composition of the future atmosphere under a warming climate.<br/><br/>This award will support measurements of the isotopic composition of nitrate in a West Antarctic ice core as a proxy for oxidant concentrations in the past atmosphere. The nitrogen isotopes of nitrate provide information on the degree of preservation of nitrate in the ice core record, and thus aid in the interpretation of the observed variability in the observed nitrate concentrations and oxygen isotopes in ice core records. By providing information about the spatial scale of oxidant changes over abrupt climate change events during the last glacial period, this project may also improve our understanding of mechanisms driving these abrupt events. Insight from this project will prove valuable for forecasting the response of stratospheric circulation to climate change, which has large implications for climate feedbacks and tropospheric composition. In addition, the information gleaned from this project on the mechanisms and feedbacks during abrupt climate change events will help determine the likelihood of such rapid events occurring in the future, which would have dramatic impacts on humankind. This award will provide training for one graduate and one undergraduate student, and will support the development of a hands-on activity related to rapid climate change to be used at the annual Polar Science Weekend at the Pacific Science Center in Seattle, WA.","plum"

Further, job applicants' privacy concerns may affect how willing they are to apply for jobs and even whether job applicants pursue legal action against employers for privacy violations. This research focuses on job applicants' concerns about the privacy of information they provide during the job application process. Specifically, this research examines which privacy issues applicants are most concerned with and how to ease those concerns. The researchers also examine how well job applicants understand explanations surrounding the technologies that employers use to maintain the privacy of applicants' personal information. By understanding how security issues can be explained effectively to users, the research will provide recommendations for the development of security practices in the online job application process and how to explain them to applicants. Insights resulting from this research will also be applicable in the broader (and constantly expanding) arenas where online privacy is a factor.<br/><br/>In Phase 1, the researchers focus on the intersection between computer science and the social sciences, utilizing an archival dataset of 77,443 online job applicants for entry-level retail jobs.

In Phase 2, the researchers conduct an online job application simulation using an experimental design to examine conclusions from Phase 1. This entails an online study of approximately 4,000 Internet users who will be asked questions typically asked on a job application. Participants are randomly assigned to conditions that provide different explanations for the technical mechanisms-such as encryption-that are used to secure their information and how the organization will use applicants' data. Participants then complete measures such as fairness of the process, employer attractiveness, self-perceptions, how much they want the job, and privacy concerns. The two studies will guide future research on how to explain privacy issues to job applicants so that applicants and employers may better protect privacy.","olive"

This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, explores how the chemical photography industry transformed these regions socially, economically, and environmentally. <br/><br/>Ali Feser, under the supervision of Dr. Joseph Masco of the University of Chicago, will investigate how chemical photography has endured in social life, in the memories of workers, and in regional ecology. First, this project will examine how displaced workers discuss Kodak's impact on social life and the local landscape, and how they understand the changes in imaging technology and the global economy that contributed to Kodak's decline. Second, through engagement with workers, public health experts, and environmentalists, this project will explore the practices of industrial chemistry and waste management that transformed the regional ecology. The researcher will undertake twenty-four months of field research in Rochester, employing a variety of social science methodologies, including participant-observation, interviews, oral histories, genealogies, archival research, and collaborations with local scientists and other experts. This research engages with long-standing and emergent concerns in anthropology, such as large-scale economic transformations, the relationship between humans and their environments, and the study of media. The results of this research will contribute to qualitative understandings of deindustrialization in the U.S. By framing accounts of lower-level employees in detailed biographical and political histories, this study will highlight the consequences of market transformation for those individuals most vulnerable to such shifts. By presenting its scientific findings to the public in accessible visual and narrative form, this research will provide tools and data to engage environmental issues.","maroon"

The general field of the meeting is computer science. Combinatorial search is an area of computer science that deals with systematic trial-and-error exploration of a very large number of alternative solutions to a problem. For example, a package delivery truck needs to visit all the addresses to which packages must be delivered, and return to its home base, ideally via the shortest possible route. NSF funding is crucial to support students who would otherwise not be able to attend the symposium. Attending such meetings and presenting their research is an important part of the professional development of students, addressing a critical shortage of highly-skilled computer scientists in the U.S.<br/><br/>SoCS brings together researchers in heuristic search and combinatorial optimization from all areas of artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, operations research, bioinformatics, and computer games. The intellectual merit of this activity stems from bringing together in one place at one time researchers from otherwise diverse areas of computer science that both advance the state of the art in heuristic search and/or combinatorial optimization, and also use these tools in their research. The broader impacts come from cross-fertilization of different fields that advance and/or use these tools, by promoting research in this area by providing a small intimate meeting on these topics, a forum for presenting such work, and archival proceedings for publishing work in this area. These latter goals are instrumental to training new researchers in this area.","indigo"

Large-scale land investments are often touted for providing local communities with access to capital, employment opportunities, and higher crop yields. Research suggests, however, that these investments are often accompanied by forced evictions, loss of livelihoods, and food insecurity. The link between large-scale land investments, food security, and peace remains poorly understood. Understanding this link has the potential to inform U.S. efforts to promote development and political stability in regions where food security and broader notions of security are intimately tied. This project contributes toward such an understanding by examining the local impact of large-scale land investments in northern Sudan, where Saudi, Egyptian and Emirati investors have recently acquired large tracts of land to grow food for export. In particular, it explores the social transformations set in motion by these land deals in Sudan's agricultural Gezira region. <br/><br/>The research will be carried out by Stanford University anthropology doctoral student, Nisrin Elamin Abdelrahman, under the supervision of Dr. James Ferguson. Through a 12-month ethnographic study in two Gezira communities, the researcher will closely examine the role local leaders play in mediating community efforts to reclaim access to lands leased to foreign investors. She will observe dispute mediations in and outside of court settings. She will also participate in the day-to-day activities of small farmers and landless agricultural workers who are negotiating the opportunities and losses produced by recent changes in land ownership. Finally, she will trace the development of a campaign led by civil society organizations aimed at building national awareness around land rights. Data will be collected using participant observation, interviews, life histories, dispute mediation observations, and archival research. The findings can inform policy efforts to better address the context-specific impact of large-scale land investments on local people's lives. By highlighting how local leadership is mobilized to prevent conflicts over land and to broaden access to it, this research will help advance both the study and practice of peace-building in the wider region. Funding this research also supports the training of a graduate student.","maroon"

The current method for corrosion protection includes the manual application of polymeric nitrocellulose, which protects objects for 10-20 years and can take 3 to 40 more hours per object depending on its size and complexity. The relatively short film lifetime and long application process leaves museums with thousands of silver objects in a constant cycle of replacing plastic coatings or leaving many objects unprotected. The proposed atomic layer deposited (ALD) coating developed by this I-Corps team is expected to fulfill the rigorous requirements required by cultural heritage institutions such as museums, archives and libraries, and fine silver jewelry manufacturers such as artisans or jewelry retailers.<br/><br/>ALD films will allow for the long term protection of cultural heritage objects, as they protect silver significantly longer than the current coating technology, applying nitrocellulose films. By reducing the amount of tarnishing and frequency of polishing, objects can be preserved longer without loss of original surface details. This I-Corps grant will allow ALD coating technology to be transferred to the cultural heritage and museum conservation community. As part of this technology transfer, the team will also develop a better understanding of how ALD metal oxide films affect the chemical structure and visual characteristics of the substrate. While ALD films applied to clean, flat, 2D surfaces is well understood, little work has been completed on the effect of using ALD films on rough, 3D objects with prior surface treatments.

This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity. As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function. Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell. However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 ""representative"" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity.","salmon"

This project marks the first time social scientists will observe the processes of the IPCC in real time, from the inside. The researchers will have a sustained opportunity to observe, analyze, and communicate how expert assessors shape climate assessments during the writing process. In turn, this research will be distributed among researchers as well as climate policy practitioners to help improve the application of climate science to policy, including the inclusion of diverse representation in the assessment process as well as the portrayal and communication of consensus, conflict, bias, error, risk, and uncertainty. This project will inform curricular development of a program in Climate Studies for undergraduate students, improve representation and capacity building among diverse climate scholars including undergraduate students and social science researchers in developing countries, communicate research findings to the public, and feed research findings back to the assessor community. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The primary purpose of this project is to contribute to ongoing scholarly attempts to understanding scientific knowledge production. The field of science studies has provided ample evidence of the empirical inadequacy of algorithmic models of scientific knowledge production, and has of late come to stress the importance of expert judgment within diverse communities. This project explicitly addresses the practice of expert judgment in a major domain of contemporary scientific activity. It will also provide suggestions to improve the assessment and decision process. Assessments are expensive in terms of time, money, and scientific human capital, and it important for the scientific community re-assess the commitment that has been made to them. The researchers will produce policy-relevant and scientist-relevant papers to convey project findings to the IPCC and involved scientist assessors. They will also present to user communities, such as at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meetings.","crimson"

Collections are especially important in predicting biodiversity change with shifts in climate and land use. The Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) houses more than 1.2 million specimens and is heavily utilized for research, education, and public outreach. From multiple sources, the Herbarium acquired 30,000 plant specimens collected by ten significant 20th century botanists. 70% of these were collected from 15 of 34 designated world biodiversity hotspots; 30% represents the California Floristic Province biodiversity hotspot. These specimens are in critical need of curation owing to poor storage conditions. Several specimens have been identified as critical for describing and naming species new to science. Curation of these collections will provide physical access to collections currently unavailable for study, promote discovery of species new to science, and yield new distribution and phenology data. Importantly, curation will ensure critically needed preservation. Digitization efforts will provide access of this rich source of specimen data to researchers, students, and the public. Integral to the project are activities involving the participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. Notably, RSABG will expand on a successful undergraduate internship program by engaging underserved youth from the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Especially targeted are at-risk and transitional aged youth at the high school level, who will be trained in a six-week summer junior intern program. All interns will participate in five workshops that will serve to connect students to collections, natural history, and biodiversity. An exhibit at RSABG will highlight the activities and student participation in the project.<br/><br/>As herbaria serve expanding needs for research, education, and conservation management, it is critical that collections of historic, taxonomic, and geographic significance are curated and digitized, ensuring their availability for research through investments in their long-term security. Through various sources, the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden acquired 30,000 vascular plant specimens of historic, taxonomic, and geographic importance representing the collections of ten significant botanists of the 20th century. These specimens are in danger of deterioration, owing to unsatisfactory past and current storage conditions (e.g., non-archival newspapers). Thus, these collections are in critical need of curation and improved storage to secure them for posterity. Several specimens have been identified as type material that was thought to have been lost. The principal objective of this three-year project is to curate and digitize these specimens through student participation. A large cadre of students at different levels in their academic career will participate in all aspects of the project, including specimen preparation, databasing, imaging, and georeferencing. Specimen data will become available for more than 18,000 species of vascular plants in ~350 families. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio, GBIF, the Consortium of California Herbaria, and the RSABG Herbarium web portal.

Many of these changes negatively affect coral reef ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide food, arable land, tourist destinations and coastline protection for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This project focuses on the effects of enhanced stratification, caused by ocean warming, on the growth of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Enhanced stratification impacts primary productivity which generates food for corals. Initial data generated by the investigators suggest that Atlantic coral growth has declined in the last 5 decades in response to these changes. A laboratory-based experiment is designed to test this hypothesis. If verified, the projected decline in Atlantic primary productivity through the 21st century could potentially rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems across the North Atlantic. Support is provided for graduate research, and undergraduate participation is facilitated through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Summer Fellowship and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences-Princeton Environmental Institute Summer Internship Programs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and disseminated in a timely manner through peer-reviewed publications. All data produced through this program will be archived in the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a principle threat to coral reef survival in the 21st century. In addition to ocean warming and acidification, global climate models project enhanced stratification of the upper oceans through the 21st century and a consequent decline in productivity, by up to 50%, in the North Atlantic. This project employs controlled laboratory manipulation experiments to test the link between productivity and growth of the dominant reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Preliminary data generated by the investigators, including multi-decade long coral growth histories and nitrogen isotope ratios of coral tissue and skeleton, suggest that coral growth across the region has declined over the past 50 years in response to productivity changes already underway. If the link between ocean circulation, productivity decline, and coral growth is verified, the projected 21st century decline in productivity could rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on North Atlantic coral reef ecosystems.","lavender"

The literature in social psychology suggests that human social cognition is fraught with a host of cognitive and motivational biases that are difficult to explain within a coherent theoretical framework. In contrast, research in other fields studying human social behavior as well as some studies in the area of social cognition suggest that people are well attuned to their immediate social environments and that apparent biases may be caused by methodological problems. The data collected in this pilot project will inform this debate and help researchers from psychology, sociology, computational social science, and other fields build more coherent models of cognitive processes underlying social judgments. Many public educational programs rely on spread of knowledge and behaviors through people's networks. Project findings regarding the accuracy of human social judgments will have implications for those programs. The data will be archived in the public repository Open Science Collaboration.<br/><br/>This research project will test the feasibility of building an innovative methodological tool called the social circle panel to study the accuracy of people's judgments about the presence of different beliefs and behaviors in their social environments. Social circles will be defined by the frequency of contact. The online panel will aim to include participants with diverse sociodemographic characteristics as well as members of their social circles or personal networks. The panel will enable both the elicitation of subjective judgments of beliefs and behaviors in individuals' social circles, and the evaluation of those judgments against objective data collected from the members of their social circles. It also will enable measurement of the stability of people's judgments over time and the investigation of whether changes in one's social circle are reflected in one's judgments. Building the panel will require dealing with a number of methodological challenges ranging from biased samples to panel contamination. The data produced by this pilot study will be useful for researchers who wish to use similar tools to understand cognitive processes underlying network effects.","crimson"

There is growing interest in the much larger, but much less well-studied, family of ternary nitride semiconductors that include, for example, zinc germanium nitride and zinc tin nitride, formed by replacing the group III binary element with equal proportions of group II and group IV elements. Many of these dozens of potentially useful materials are composed entirely of earth-abundant, inexpensive, and benign elements. The increased complexity of the ternary nitrides, and the greater number of materials and combinations, is expected to lead to new materials properties and more flexibility in their design. This project will accelerate research on this new family of materials by combining efforts in theoretical calculations and modeling of devices and properties with synthesis and characterization focused on an important subset of these materials. Dissemination of new and archived results via an interactive website-accessed database available freely to the community will foster a growing network among research groups that will accelerate progress toward understanding and controlling the properties of these materials and developing new applications for them.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The research will focus on developing growth and doping methods for ZnGeN2 and ZnGeN2-GaN mixed ternary-binary heterostructures by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). This focus will take strategic advantage of the mature technology for GaN growth and doping, earlier demonstrations of successful growth of ZnGeN2 by MOCVD, the close lattice mismatch of the two materials, and their close optimized growth conditions. The focus additionally will take advantage of the theoretically predicted large band offset between the two materials, which have similar band gaps in the near-ultraviolet, in the design and synthesis of the interesting heterostructure and alloy systems that result from this situation. The theoretical and experimental results, combined with the development of a network, based upon the publicly accessible database website for research groups working in this area, will lay the foundation for expanding research efforts on this large family of materials.","goldenrod"

The researchers in this project are looking for short-term, near-term and long-term changes while researching new and evolving methods to observe properties and to process the collected observations. Emerging technologies enable us to provide and discover the data openly and freely. But, if we do not understand the newly discovered data, with its inherent limitations and biases, it cannot be responsibly utilized for new or collaborative research efforts. Working with environmental sensor manufacturers and researchers, the X-DOMES project will develop tools and social and technical infrastructure to facilitate the creation of data about data (metadata). Metadata describes not only who, when and where the observations were made, but also it must document how an observation came to be (provenance). By taking this knowledge out of manuals and human-readable documents, the X-DOMES model creates metadata that can be treated like data ? discoverable and searchable, making it ready to be incorporated into automated archival and processing for quality assurance and validation methods. <br/><br/>Leveraging existing relationships with large NSF-funded data management programs, EarthCube building blocks and working groups, and environmental sensor manufacturers and consortia, we will establish a community of sensor manufacturers and other stakeholders to provide a unifying approach to describing sensors and observations across geo-science domains. Built on an existing sensor metadata model that references registered, standards-based vocabularies, the X-DOMES pilot project will provide a suite of tools, built upon community-adopted standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to demonstrate and facilitate the generation of documents that are discoverable and accessible on-line and/or directly from onboard sensor descriptions. The project will also demonstrate mechanisms to associate the data with the metadata through standards-based web services.

Moreover, not all species change their seasonal flowering time in response to the same climate factors. Consequently, as climate changes, some species may flower too early, resulting in exposure to winter frosts, while others may flower too late or fail to shift their flowering enough to reproduce successfully. This project will improve our understanding of how the timing of flowering by individual species and groups of plant species shift in response to future climatic conditions. This research is essential for forecasting the future availability of floral resources for pollinators and other animals that feed on nectar and pollen, as well as for assessing plant risk of exposure to frost damage, herbivore activity, and other seasonal stresses (e.g., summer drought). To date, however, no comprehensive, continental study of the direction and magnitude of changes in flowering time in response to changes in climate has been conducted. This project will create a single, large database and make all data available online to the public. In addition, this project will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>Preliminary evidence suggests that the magnitude of phenological responsiveness (or sensitivity) to climate changes may be conserved among closely related and functionally similar taxa. Consequently, it may be possible to predict the phenology of species that have not been studied through examination of closely related taxa that are well-documented. Hundreds of thousands of electronic records archived in educational and research institutions throughout the United States provide standardized information about plant specimens collected by botanists across the U.S. over the past 200 years, including the date and location where each specimen was collected and whether it was flowering on the date of collection. This research integrates these disparate records into a single database, and leverages them to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across >1000 well-sampled species. In turn, this information will be used to forecast shifts in seasonal flowering under projected climate scenarios. Digital herbarium records and recorded in situ observations will be used to evaluate the factors influencing historical and contemporary flowering times across an unprecedented diversity of angiosperms (>1000 species, each represented by >100 specimens; >400 genera; 80 families).

The project focuses on the use of humanitarian claims in interventions driven primarily by national security concerns to better understand how these justifications affect the relationship between the public and war. the PI argues that high levels of public support for humanitarian interventions create an incentive for presidents to stretch the limits of humanitarian claims, which can have two unintended and potentially negative consequences. First, presidents may use humanitarian justifications to convince the public to support otherwise unpopular interventions. Second, the over-use of humanitarian claims may create a skeptical public, making it harder to build support to prevent mass atrocities in the future. The PI investigates the consequences of this use of the humanitarian frame in three ways: 1) she considers how the prominence of humanitarian justifications has changed over time, 2) she examines when presidents are most likely to rely on humanitarian claims, and 3) she examines whether there are limits to the public' willingness to accept humanitarian explanations. The research has implications for when the U.S. will intervene in the future, especially in response to mass atrocities, and for the public's ability to hold presidents accountable for military action.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>To examine the role of humanitarian justifications in contemporary U.S. military interventions, the PI employs a multi-methods approach with three distinct steps: 1) content analysis of presidential speeches, 2) comparative case studies of interventions, and 3) a survey experiment on the conditions under which individuals support humanitarian appeals. First, the PI uses dictionary-based content analysis of national presidential addresses to construct an original dataset that tracks the frequency of three justification categories for all potential U.S. interventions from 1945 to 2013. Second, she examines three pairs of interventions and non-interventions from three presidential administrations. Using primary sources from the National Security Archives and presidential libraries, these case studies examine when, within cases of intervention, presidents are most likely to emphasize humanitarian claims. The case studies also highlight how and why humanitarian concerns become a part of official justifications for military action and the role of international actors. Third, the PI uses a survey experiment to investigate the conditions under which humanitarian justifications increase support for intervention. In particular, it considers whether support is conditional on the public's belief that humanitarian claims are sincere and that military action is primarily motivated by humanitarian concerns.","crimson"

Many of these changes negatively affect coral reef ecosystems, reducing their ability to provide food, arable land, tourist destinations and coastline protection for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This project focuses on the effects of enhanced stratification, caused by ocean warming, on the growth of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Enhanced stratification impacts primary productivity which generates food for corals. Initial data generated by the investigators suggest that Atlantic coral growth has declined in the last 5 decades in response to these changes. A laboratory-based experiment is designed to test this hypothesis. If verified, the projected decline in Atlantic primary productivity through the 21st century could potentially rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on coral reef ecosystems across the North Atlantic. Support is provided for graduate research, and undergraduate participation is facilitated through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Summer Fellowship and the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences-Princeton Environmental Institute Summer Internship Programs. The results will be presented at national and international meetings and disseminated in a timely manner through peer-reviewed publications. All data produced through this program will be archived in the Biological and Chemical Oceanographic Data Management Office.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a principle threat to coral reef survival in the 21st century. In addition to ocean warming and acidification, global climate models project enhanced stratification of the upper oceans through the 21st century and a consequent decline in productivity, by up to 50%, in the North Atlantic. This project employs controlled laboratory manipulation experiments to test the link between productivity and growth of the dominant reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Bermuda. Preliminary data generated by the investigators, including multi-decade long coral growth histories and nitrogen isotope ratios of coral tissue and skeleton, suggest that coral growth across the region has declined over the past 50 years in response to productivity changes already underway. If the link between ocean circulation, productivity decline, and coral growth is verified, the projected 21st century decline in productivity could rival and will certainly exacerbate the effects of warming and ocean acidification on North Atlantic coral reef ecosystems.","lavender"

This research project will expand the explanatory power of land-change research by considering a factor that has not been adequately studied, namely social processes stemming from unequal access to land resources. The project's investigators will broaden the concept of land-change agency or responsibility, often deployed uncritically in land-change research, by considering social actions and reactions occurring over decadal time periods and by actors who do not always behave in economically ""rational"" ways. The researchers will develop a comprehensive perspective on land change for southeastern Para state of northern Brazil, a laboratory and battleground for myriad Amazonian development initiatives. To characterize land change between 1984 and 2010, including deforestation, reforestation, and forest patch dynamics, the researchers will employ remote sensing and landscape ecology techniques. To examine the social process aspects of land change, especially contention over land, they will conduct a thorough news media analysis covering more than 5,000 news accounts of conflict. They will complement this archival research with field interviews and intensive case-studies involving at least five landowners and many local key informants. By mixing field interviews with remote sensing and landscape ecology, the researchers will treat Amazonian land change as an integrated system of processes, not just a singular process of deforestation driven by ""rational"" economic decisions. The investigators expect to find that properties that play host to contention displayed greater overall deforestation and increased (or different) forest fragmentation patterns than for properties that were not contested. The researchers will seek to ascertain whether contention has led to a forest structure shift, creating a more complex forest landscape with negative implications for the region's ecology.<br/><br/>This project will reframe land change in the study area as a process occurring within a context of social contention, and it will shed light on how social processes and multiple, sometimes simultaneous, land managers affect land change.

It will provide new perspectives for evaluating initiatives to reduce deforestation via the UN's REDD program and have policy relevance in many other nations.

These circulation cells have been argued to respond to and play an important role in modulating/maintaining major climatic phenomena, including ENSO, and are also relevant to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Moreover, there is mounting evidence of decade-timescale changes in the strength of these circulation cells which may have significant climate impacts on even larger scales. Transient tracers highlight the pathways of newly ventilated water into the ocean. Their time-evolving distributions provide quantitative constraints on water mass formation rates and circulation, and the rates of biogeochemical processes. Tritium is a valuable transient tracer because it has a distinctive time history and boundary condition that yields additional information to other tracers. Moreover, its daughter Helium-3 provides additional, unique information because of its complementary (nutrient-like) boundary conditions to all other transient tracers. Extending the time series to longer times provides a description of both longer time-scale ventilation processes and the opportunity to diagnose time variations in the short time-scale processes. Additionally, the evolution toward smaller spatial gradients in the tritium distribution and reduced time derivatives further minimizes non-linear behavior in the tritium/Helium-3 age. Through the reoccupation of key hydrographic sections, observation of the evolving distributions of these tracers will provide powerful constraints on theories and models of ocean circulation and ventilation. The processed data set will be archived and made publicly available through established data centers.. This data will be accessible to a wide range of research enterprises involved in modelling ocean circulation, ventilation, and climate change. <br/><br/>Tracers, and in particular radioactive and transient tracers (e.g., chlorofluorocarbons, radiocarbon, tritium/Helium-3), have been integral to both the WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) and CLIVAR (CLImate VARiability and predictability program) hydrographic programs and are valuable tools for studying ocean ventilation and its variations on climatic scales. Recognizing that global change is already affecting the oceans, the CLIVAR program has sought to re-occupy key WOCE sections at roughly decade time-scale intervals since2003. The primary objectives of this project are to document the temporal evolution of the distributions of the transient tracers tritium and Helium-3 over the 24 years since the WOCE occupation, and to use this information to diagnose the changing rates of thermocline ventilation and meridional overturning in the shallow Pacific Ocean. Moreover, the longer term evolution of these tracers on density horizons that do not directly outcrop in the North Pacific may provide useful constraints on the effect of mixing processes on ventilation of those density horizons. The investigators will analyze and interpret helium isotope and tritium measurements on samples acquired on the 2015 occupation of the P16N section in the central North Pacific that crosses the northern subpolar and subtropical gyres as well as the northern and southern tropics.","lavender"

A unique long-term experiment will advance general understanding of the resilience of natural communities to ecological perturbations of different sizes, the extent to which ecological transitions are reversible when environmental conditions are restored, and the predictability of ecological communities when perturbed. The research team includes a high school teacher from Maine who has a long association with this project. Six to eight of her students will participate in the field research each year, and the teacher will develop classroom activities appropriate for high school students and K-12 teachers. Primary data, panoramic photographs of the experimental plots, and educational activities will be available electronically, and the investigators will post a YouTube video on data archiving and management. <br/><br/>The researchers will test hypotheses that (1) switches between alternative community states of mussel beds and rockweed stands occur in response to infrequent, large-scale occurrences of ice scour during winter, (2) the community that becomes established in large clearings made by ice scour is not predictable, (3) the order of species arrival during re-establishment drives community development and (4) the alternative communities are stable. These hypotheses will be tested using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design consisting of experimental clearings of different sizes, uncleared controls that were created in 1996-97, and half of these controls that were cleared again in 2010-11. In addition to collecting data characterizing patterns of succession in these developing communities, the researchers will assay rates of predation on mussels, mortality rates of mussels in patches of different sizes, and recruitment of juveniles of four key species annually. Analyses of data will compare outcomes from the first run of the experiment (1997-2008) with those from the second run (2011-2021) to test if community development is predictable.

In general, the PI views the politics of immigration as the tug of war between voters who oppose low-skilled workers on various grounds and firms who favor foreign labor. In contrast to much of the existing literature on immigration that tends to focus on native voters' preferences for immigration, the PI focuses on the role of labor-intensive firms in immigration policymaking. He classifies firms into two broad categories, firms that face competition in the international goods market (tradable sector) and firms that offer domestic services that cannot be traded (non-tradable sector). The PI argues that firms in the tradable sector are much more likely to support more open immigration policy and identify two factors that explain the decline of pro-immigration firms: a sudden windfall from capital-intensive natural resources, such as oil and natural gas, and increasing competition in the global goods market. Using new data on immigration policy and field research in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, the PI demonstrates that his theoretical framework is not limited to the U.S. and Canada but is generalizable across a variety of cases. He also finds that a country's immigration policy does not generally respond to short-term labor needs or unorganized native opposition, but merely reflects the relative political power of pro- or anti-immigration groups.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The project takes advantage of newly assembled data on immigration policies of wealthy economies around the world. Following the existing literature, the PI classifies immigration policy into more than a dozen policy dimensions, including citizenship regime, restrictions on inflows, and immigrant rights. The PI uses a principal component analysis to extract two factors scores, one that measures the policy restrictive of immigration entry and the other that measures the scope of immigrant rights. Using the time-series cross-sectional data on immigration policy, he runs a set of ordinary least squares analyses to test the effects of trade liberalization and natural resource booms on immigration policy development.

Taken together, state migration policies, refugee laws, and international agreements constitute what is here termed the ""refugee regime"" - a set of institutional practices through which the migration policies of countries in the West and the Middle East have become increasingly interconnected. This research draws attention to (1) the transnational activities of state agencies, humanitarian organizations, and non-state actors in managing forced migration, and (2) forced migrants' experiences along their journeys. In doing so, this research re-situates the politics of migration management from a top-down disembodied conception to one informed by the everyday encounters, narratives, and struggles of forced migrants themselves. This research will make important contributions to the field of political geography and broader interdisciplinary debates in refugee studies, security and border studies, and feminist methodology. This study further seeks to interrogate popular representations of forced migrants as passive victims or burdens on the welfare state. Findings from this research will inform public debates about Syrian forced migrants through a series of public information workshops and policy briefs. Research findings will be disseminated to wider society in order to foster a better understanding of forced migrants' lives and the challenges that migrants' face.<br/>Findings from this research will also inform the co-PI's undergraduate teaching on international migration, transnationalism, and geography. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>This project responds to calls for studies on how migration management works across national borders and how migrants experience and negotiate their journeys between places of departure and arrival. It does so by answering two central research questions: 1) How is the refugee regime constituted across transnational space? 2) How do Syrian forced migrants experience the refugee regime across their migration trajectory and once they arrive in their final destination? In order to answer these questions this project comprises archival research, interviews, and participatory mapping with Syrian forced migrants, as well as interviews with staff of state and non-state institutions. Using these methods, this research contributes new findings to scholarship on the securitization of migration and the changing geographies of borders and migration management.","maroon"

The project begins with an examination of Pre-Linnaean bound manuscripts and Enlightenment-era printed texts. It culminates with a careful examination of the contemporary Catalogue of Life, a federated database containing the largest cache of taxonomic information of the known forms of life on Earth. One goal of the project is to show how taxonomy-disseminating technologies influence the construction and use of classification systems. Attention will be given to the Western-centric nature of these scientific systems of organization, and how one method of classification may not fit all of our global needs. The taxonomies that are the focus of this study arose from distinctly Western traditions, and evolved with their presuppositions engrained in their infrastructure. As a result, their taxonomic conventions can conflict with culturally and geographically local and endemic descriptive methods. Another goal of this study is to bring some of these cultural biases to light. By broadening discussion about these systems, new modes of cross-communicable and flexible taxonomic infrastructures between communities are more likely to occur. By bridging local biodiversity knowledge (endemic, underrepresented, cultural marginalized, citizen science, etc.) with larger scientific infrastructures, and by pooling our global knowledge resources in a more open, culturally attentive way, the chances of maintaining what natural biological species exist today increases exponentially. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>This project will contribute to our understanding of how the forms in which we disseminate taxonomic information influence the way that information is used and understood to fundamentally relate to our knowledge of the world, and to the way in which their ontological organization is influenced by inherited epistemologies from previous taxonomic systems. Additionally, given the widespread use of taxonomy databases in number of disciplines, this study can shed light on the multivariate uses of taxonomies and promote more inter-disciplinary collaboration and communication regarding the construction, organization, and flexibility of these infrastructures. Finally, by looking at scientific knowledge organization systems from an historical, information, and technical framework, we can learn much about how the contemporary world deals with, and can potentially solve, the often-incommensurate information structures embedded into the myriad of digital systems, software, and idiosyncratic computational platforms that are encountered daily, a problem assured to amplify in the future.","crimson"

The concept of legibility refers to a continuous political process, in which states use familiar idioms between them and their subjects to exert political and economic control over local populations. Legibility may serve the state as a tool of political subjugation, but it also may reinforce shared idioms in ways that were leveraged by local communities for their own interests. As with modern societies, past ones were subject to processes of global politics, yet the growing gap in the anthropological understanding of the inner workings of ancient and modern empires has rendered local/global relationships in the past into a simplified dichotomy of direct/indirect control. Through an interdisciplinary archaeological and historical approach, this research will investigate the critical period when the rules of imperial control were negotiated and established. This project significantly contributes and expands currently scholarship: 1. by using the concept of legibility to analyze the specific means through which subject groups shape political and economic processes of imperialism; 2. in characterizing a single imperial strategy as a diachronic process, from its local inception to negotiation between imperial and local practices; 3. by situating this research within global issues of state and local interaction. <br/><br/>Mrs. Hernï¿½ndez and her research team will use archaeological excavation, mapping, archival research, and specialized material analyses, to investigate the role of public ritual and places as critical idioms of interaction between the Inka Empire and the local community in the Huarochirï¿½ region in the Peruvian Andes. Over the course of a hundred years, the Inka created the largest empire in the Americas, extending at its height over 906,000 km2 of western South America and weaving together a patchwork of ethnic diversity. Through targeted excavations in two sites containing both local and Inka standard public spaces and through an interdisciplinary methodology, this project will reveal a subtle means of hegemonic interaction that helped to shape Inka imperialism and the diverse material signatures of state imposition. This project will offer collaborative education and training opportunities for U.S. and Peruvian archaeology and history students, and will promote collaboration with local community members and Peruvian academic institutions. This research is of direct relevance to foster a critical understanding of how imperial policies created the conditions for incorporating and maintaining mutually legible local/state practices and how local forms helped to shape state politics.","maroon"

Kaco' is an Austro-Asiatic language of the Mon Khmer family and, like other languages of this family, Kaco' is phonologically complex and unusual. Olsen's study of Kaco' will therefore advance knowledge of what types of phonological systems are possible for human languages. In addition, because sounds and sound processes provide important clues to language relatedness, Olsen's description of Kaco' sound patterns will facilitate hypotheses on the features that are unique to or characteristic of the Austroasiatic language family and will help disambiguate historical relationships between languages and speaker groups of the region.<br/><br/>The primary research questions involve the description of the sound patterns of the Kaco' language including contrastive vowels and consonants and their phonetic variants, the structure of Kaco' syllables; laryngeal contrasts in Kaco'syllables and their phonetic properties and phonological domains. Olsen's study will focus on documenting complex syllable structure and the role between syllables within a word. She will document phonation (vocal fold vibration) and tonogenesis (e.g., the birth of tone through consonant weakening). <br/><br/>In order to pursue these research questions, Olsen will collect speech samples from Kaco' speakers from several villages. Her data samples will include recordings of freeform narratives, wordlists, songs, and community folklore.

This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity. As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function. Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell. However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 ""representative"" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity.","salmon"

The number of these structures and their shapes give each neuron a particular appearance, and allow neurons to form specific connections with each other that result in the nervous system's ability to function properly. Currently, the ways in which particular combinations of molecules regulate axon and dendrite morphology in the developing nervous system of mammals are not well understood. Previous scientific work has found a family of molecules called Semaphorins that control both axon and dendrite morphology by binding to molecules on the outer membrane of nerve cells (called receptors). This project will investigate what happens inside developing nerve cells after Semaphorin molecules bind to their receptors, in order to provide invaluable new details about the molecular control systems inside cells that ultimately determine the proper formation of neuronal connections and signaling functions. In addition to this scientific goal, this project will integrate research, mentorship and education for minority high school, undergraduate and graduate students through their joint involvement in STEM enrichment opportunities. Due to a unique collaboration between the principal investigator and a scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, an exchange program will also be established to provide female scientists with broader exposure and training experiences at both the national and international level. Data generated from this study will be disseminated in the form of presentations at national/international scientific meetings, and will be published in peer-reviewed journals that can be accessed by other scientists and the general public. New reagents and resources generated from this study will be freely shared with the broader scientific community and will be sent to archiving databases and repositories. <br/><br/>Neurons exhibit diverse morphologies, and developmentally acquire the unique axonal and dendritic arborizations necessary for their specific functions. Cell surface receptors are known to control this complex process, mainly by eliciting attractive/permissive or repulsive/inhibitory cellular responses in distinct neuronal populations. However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying these multi-functional responses to receptor-initiated signaling events are still poorly understood. The Plexin-A4 receptor that binds the Semaphorin-3A ligand is known to collapse growth cones on the axons of sensory neurons, while it promotes dendrite formation in cortical neurons. The specific aims of the present project are to 1) elucidate the mechanistic logic underlying these disparate functions of the Plexin-A4 receptor; and 2) to determine whether the Plexin-A4 cytoplasmic domains activate similar or different intracellular signaling cascades during axon collapse and dendrite formation. Novel mouse genetic tools generated for this project will be used to determine which signaling cytoplasmic domains of Plexin-A4 are required for these disparate functions. One candidate Plexin-A4 downstream interactor that may play key roles in both axon growth cone collapse and dendrite elaboration will be examined following semaphorin activation of Plexin-A4 signaling in sensory versus cortical neurons. High-throughput, morphology based siRNA screening will be performed to identify additional novel downstream components of the Plexin-A4 signaling cascade that regulate dendrite and growth cone behaviors. The results will provide key mechanistic insights about how neurons establish their unique cellular morphologies, explain how Plexin-A4 regulates axon and dendrite behavior, and identify novel molecules in the Semaphorin-3A signaling pathway that impact the formation and organization of neuronal connections during nervous system development.","teal"

However, there are gaps in our knowledge regarding the types of active learning environments that are most effective for particular contexts. This Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) project at Lehman College and Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY) will investigate chemistry students' learning in two different active-learning environments: a flipped classroom format and an interactive lecture format. In the flipped classroom format, students learn new content outside of the classroom by reviewing learning objectives and viewing video content developed by course instructors, and spend their time in the classroom refining and applying their knowledge to chemistry problems under the guidance of the instructor. In the interactive lecture format, students listen to short lectures of 15-20 minutes followed by peer instruction sessions in which students answer questions posed by the instructor (using personal response systems known as clickers) and discuss them with their peers. These two formats both aim to engage students more deeply in learning chemistry and developing skills such as monitoring their thinking as compared with traditional lecture formats. Chemistry faculty at Hunter College and Lehman College will leverage their experiences developing and implementing these general chemistry courses with diverse student populations over the last five years, and collaborate with CUNY's Director of the Center for Advanced Study in Education, to study and compare the effectiveness of these two active learning formats.<br/><br/>To contribute to a better understanding of the effectiveness of flipped classroom and interactive lecture formats for enhancing student learning and metacognition, the investigators will conduct two types of studies. First, investigators will analyze archival data from previous implementations in general chemistry at Hunter College, including student exam performance and course completion rates, and compare the results across the two active learning formats. Second, the project team will conduct new efficacy studies in which students taking general chemistry at both Hunter and Lehman Colleges will be randomly assigned to a flipped classroom or interactive lecture format. The project team will analyze student-level performance data on both formative and summative assessments and, investigate whether particular cohorts of students learn better using a flipped classroom or interactive lecture format. In addition, the investigators will explore the extent to which students' metacognitive and self-regulatory behaviors change over time for each format. Finally, they will examine students' use of online homework and video resources, and determine how these are related to student learning. The diversity of the student populations across many dimensions at Hunter and Lehman Colleges of CUNY, which are also Hispanic-serving institutions, makes them excellent contexts in which to study the effectiveness of different active-learning formats for a variety of students. The results of this research are expected to inform science faculty members about the effectiveness and best practices associated with two popular active-learning formats, and to contribute to the development of instructional design principles for undergraduate science courses.","cyan"

This work will produce a reusable distributed service architecture achieving scalability by using distributed services that maintain ledger information. The system leverages Bitcoin cryptocurrency by building on Bitcoin's block-chain architecture to maintain provenance metadata securely. It leverages existing tools for provenance data exploration and visualization. Digital signatures from both the server/system as well as the user creates dual information about possession, while distributed ledgers remove control and maintenance of metadata from the user who creates it. The prototype enables research into long-term provenance creation, maintenance, and utilization for workflows in the area of cybersecurity as well studies of how to integrate and secure provenance into existing file systems and network services. Opt-in and passive (involuntary) provenance systems will be enabled using the API, library, and distributed ledgers prototyped, enabling data provenance for systems where needed, notably high assurance cloud computing and scientific workflow systems.

The vast majority of such land deals are taking place in the global South, where the impetus for short-term economic development often overshadows concerns for sustainable peace and development. For this reason, land deals often lead to dispossession for ethnic, indigenous, and other marginalized peoples and exacerbate existing conflicts over territory, resources, and power. This can in turn destabilize entire regions where the U.S. might have strategic economic and political interests. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of rigorous, empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, examines the relationship between land law and sustainable peace and development efforts.<br/><br/>Cornell University doctoral student, Emily Hong, under the direction of Dr. Annelise Riles, will undertake the research in the Burma-China-Thailand borderlands, with a primary base in Kachin State, Burma. Taking an ethnographic approach to examining policy in practice, the researcher will examine the significance of land law for ordinary people often left out of expert-dominated discussions on development. Burma/Myanmar provides an ideal setting for understanding these dynamics, due to the centrality of land and ethnic identity in ongoing peace talks and legal reforms. Through year-long ethnographic fieldwork with activists, farmers, and intellectuals, the researcher will investigate two spheres in which Kachin people attempt to shape their political future: land law and indigenous media through extensive interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and archival research. On a national level, the researcher will focus on a current campaign for customary land law, part of a growing global trend that seeks state recognition of ancestral or indigenous land use practices; on a local level, she will examine the work of local activists and farmers who document land-based dispossession, cultivate local solutions to development problems, and create their own widely-circulating media. The project seeks to understand not only the impacts of state-led processes of law and development in the global land rush but how ordinary people actively shape alternatives for sustainable peace and development. The project will advance the fields of cultural anthropology and law and social sciences, particularly in the areas of political anthropology, legal anthropology and the interdisciplinary study of human rights, studies of indigenous sovereignty and political change, and collaborative ethnography.","maroon"

This fact is somewhat taken for granted in biodiversity studies of plants and animals, but is at the forefront of discovering novel microbial biodiversity. As an electrical charge flows through energy transfer molecules in a cell, it is coupled to the production of ATP molecules (akin to charging the battery that powers the cell) or the production of other compounds that are critical for life function. Until recently, it was thought that all cells require electron energy transfer molecules that are soluble in water, so that they can be brought into the cell. However, scientists discovered that some bacteria are able to use solid metals such as rust (iron oxides) located outside the cell as an energy source. They do so by shuttling electrons from the inside of the cell to the outside of the cell, via energy transfer molecules that deliver electrical charge to metal deposits in the environment. In other words, part of these microbes' energy production pathways have evolved to be outside of the cell. This process, termed extracellular electron transfer (EET), transformed how we think about cellular life and in particular how microbes may impact the global elemental cycles that sustain life on Earth. This research team will conduct the first wide-ranging assessment of the diversity of EET across all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya). The project will also broaden public understanding about microbial life through developing interactive museum exhibits that present microbial EET to the public. Project investigators will work with the Encyclopedia of Life to broaden the representation of microbes in their databases and in school curricula. The project is also uniquely poised to strengthen industry and academic pipelines through educational curriculum that engages middle school students in interdisciplinary EET research, and a pedagogical training and lab exchange program that affords students and postdoctoral scholars an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research. <br/><br/>Consistent with the objectives of the DIMENSIONS program, this proposal aims to establish the degree to which ribotypes and genotypes relate to function and activity. This is also a grand challenge in environmental microbiology, and our ability to use bioelectrochemical systems to selectively target electroactive communities affords a unique opportunity to selectively isolate and characterize microbes capable of extracellular electron transfer (EET). To these ends, the overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively assess and relate the phylogenetic diversity, genetic/genomic diversity, and functional diversity of microorganisms engaged in EET across all three domains of life. The work plan includes: 1) conducting the first broad, systematic assessment of the phylogenetic diversity of EET-enabled microbes in natural habitats; 2) using the results of these data to identify 20 ""representative"" communities for co-registered metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and biogeochemical characterization to target differentially expressed transcripts associated with EET and the biogeochemical processes that are mediated by these communities; 3) characterizing the genetic, biochemical and biophysical attributes of cultivated but uncharacterized microbes commonly found on electroactive surfaces; 4) integrating these results to develop a better capacity to predict the physiologies and biogeochemical impacts of electroactive communities in nature; and 5) archiving these data in robust databases to allow others to relate the project's findings to their data. These efforts will provide, for the first time, a comprehensive dataset linking phylogenetic data (16S, 18S) with functional potential (genomics), physiological poise (transcriptomics) and metabolic activity (geochemical measurements) that will have many applications to beyond biodiversity science. For example, the combined 'omics and rate measurements will allow the investigators to constrain the extent to which EET contributes to biogeochemical cycles in nature. The transposon mutagenesis and biophysical studies, in turn, will help researchers understand the means by which common but poorly characterized microbes carry out EET. While the value of each of the proposed efforts is significant, the coordination of these activities enables true integration of these findings to provide a comprehensive perspective on the relationships among phylogenetic, genomic and physiological diversity.","salmon"

Ocean general circulation models (OGCMs) resolve stirring on scales larger than ~30 km, and regional models on scales ~1 km, but isopycnal (lateral) stirring by submesoscale (1 to 10 km) and finescale (10 m to 1 km) processes must be parameterized. Tracer-release experiments consistently find isopycnal diffusivities at scales of 1-10 km to be an order of magnitude larger than predictions for internal-wave shear dispersion. This project will provide a more complete and accurate assessment of the roles of internal waves and vortical mode in lateral stirring at the submesoscale of order 10 m to 10 km), and the cascade of energy to dissipative vertical scales, to resolve this paradox. Internal waves and vortical mode are difficult to distinguish observationally. However, judicious use of a numerical model can tease apart their influences by isolating different physics. A major advantage of the approach of this project is that all of the above processes/dynamics can be explored in the context of a single model, allowing us to seamlessly explore the internal-wave cascade and lateral dispersion by the different mechanisms across a wide range of parameter regimes and forcing conditions. The proposed simulations will elucidate the underlying physics and inform our understanding of how these processes work in the ocean so as to provide an order-one parameterization of submesoscale isopycnal diffusivities for OGCMs. Parameterizations developed in this study will be made available through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Two graduate students will be trained in high resolution numerical modeling and data analysis techniques. A public project website will also be maintained, with initial conditions and parameters for our simulations archived and shared on request with other investigators interested in collaboration.<br/><br/>The proposed approach will use a Boussinesq pseudo-spectral model to investigate lateral dispersion and the internal-wave energy cascade. Specific goals are to determine the roles of (1) wave/wave and wave/vortex interactions in the internal-wave cascade to small vertical scales and turbulence production, (2) wave/wave and wave/vortex de-phasing of the internal wave field in isopycnal stirring, (3) turbulent intermittency in internal-wave shear dispersion, and (4) vortical-mode shear dispersion and stirring. Model results will also be used to examine (5) the physics of the finescale roll-off and (6) the statistics of unstable shear events (Richardson number less than a quarter). Simulations with and without finescale potential vorticity production by internal-wave breaking will be used to isolate the roles of the vortical-mode inverse cascade. Passive tracers subject to diapycnal mixing and non-diffusive Lagrangian particles will be used to distinguish between shear dispersion and stirring. The simulations will be run with varying buoyancy frequency, Coriolis frequency, internal-wave spectral energy level and frequency spectral shapes to explore fundamental parameter dependences of the cascade, finescale roll-off, Richardson Number statistics, diapycnal diffusion and isopycnal diffusion. First-order submesoscale horizontal diffusivities for OGCMs and regional models will result. Different forcings (surface wind, tidal) for maintaining the internal-wave field in a statistically steady state will be tested. Profiling float and dye data collected in the Sargasso Sea during summer will be used to guide model initialization and assess the realism of the results. Where possible, differences in modelled dispersion characteristics will be identified and used to identify stirring mechanisms in the observational data sets.","lavender"

Aflatoxins are a class of mycotoxins, toxic chemicals produced by fungi that often grow on crops. Aflatoxins cause up to 172,000 cases of lethal liver cancer globally per year. This research project will study the production of knowledge about liver cancer and aflatoxin, as well as its causes and prevention by tracing the history of aflatoxins since the early 1960s when it was discovered by veterinarians as being responsible for the widespread death of poultry. The discovery of aflatoxins lead to studies asking if there was a causal link between aflatoxin and liver cancer in humans. In the 1970s, regulators had begun introducing thresholds for aflatoxin in food and feed and for prescribing standardized tests to determine aflatoxin contamination. Plant scientists began to study and identify the conditions of aflatoxin development in crops in order to prevent the occurrence in humans and livestock. This project will focus on how aflatoxin became a health problem, how different scientific disciplines, institutions, and research practices have interacted to produce knowledge about cancer, and how this knowledge shaped regulation and public health interventions. The findings will be used to guide policy targeting health safety and agriculture standards.<br/><br/><br/>This project contributes to the historical literature on science because biomedical understandings of the relation between aflatoxins and liver cancer has grown more complex, as scientists have studied the synergistic influences of genes, hepatitis virus infections, and aflatoxins on the carcinogenesis of liver cancer with methods of molecular epidemiology and tumor genome sequencing. The results of the research will be of interest to historians of science and scholars of development, regulation, and science policy. The research will be done in archives where scientific records of national and international health organizations are housed. The project will also complete oral histories to document how the disciplines of toxicology, epidemiology, veterinary medicine, and plant sciences have interacted to produce knowledge about cancer and aflatoxins. The project will explore the relationship of laboratory and field by studying how regulatory regimes and scientific knowledge have influenced each other since the early 1960s. In addition the project will map out the research networks formed by scientists to understand how different scales, disciplines, and settings of research and regulation interacted to produce knowledge about cancer and aflatoxins. The project will show how research interactions, practices and approaches changed as the Cold War ended and genetics gained an increasing importance in the life sciences. A historical understanding of the interaction of regulatory regimes and knowledge-making will help to develop more effective policies.","crimson"

A major challenge for all research entities is the management of this digital asset and associated information for maintaining its value. This challenge is complex in nature, covering not only the collection and storage of data, but also the creation of relevant (and sufficient) information about the data (metadata), such that they can be re-used broadly. Several environmental data repositories and data management approaches have been developed over the past few years. It is now time to seek input from researchers in the role of data authors and data re-users and data managers, to expansively explore the current operating environment, potential collaboration opportunities, efficiencies of scale, and future community needs for this challenge to be addressed effectively. An initial workshop will allow these stakeholders to share their expertise, experience and future requirements with their colleagues. The output from this initial exercise will then feed into a second session, which will result in strategic recommendations detailing the activities needed to create a collaborative and efficient data management infrastructure capable of supporting future environmental science research endeavors. <br/><br/>Most current environmental data repositories fulfill specific needs or objectives, i.e., archiving and disseminating data from a project, network of research sites, institution, a specific funding source, or to accompany paper publications. Envisioning a sustained Scientific Data Infrastructure (SDI), and with the goal of providing high quality data to researchers, policy makers and the general public, this project concentrates on data repositories and current curation practices as an integral part of this vision. Within this scope and in the context of environmental research data management, original goals and objectives of single repositories will be re-evaluated, efficiencies of scale identified, a cost-benefit analyses for some centralized services attempted, and new, sustainable collaborations conceptualized. Specifically, data curators from a range of environmental research fields, data aggregators, tool developers, computer scientists and environmental scientists (both data providers and users) will be brought together for an informed dialog which draws on this broad collective experience. A preliminary information-gathering phase will describe the characteristics of each repository to inform the discussion at two subsequent community workshops. The first workshop will identify new collaboration and curation strategies that also cater to the currently underserved single investigators and move environmental data from ""available"" to ""usable"", in order to accelerate scientific inquiry. The second workshop will examine these strategies further, and develop one or more alternative, community-vetted roadmaps for research information management with the goal of more efficiently and sustainably utilizing NSF investments. In summary, these workshops will produce a strategic implementation plan outlining one or more options for a sustained environmental data management infrastructure capable of accelerating scientific inquiry, serve all contributing investigators (data producers) and provide the basis for education and outreach activities in a cost effective approach.

The scientific goals are to image the magma producing regions beneath the Juan de Fuca and Gorda spreading centers, to understand the thermal evolution of an oceanic plates and to determine how the plate deforms over time. In the region where the plate begins to bend downward at the onset of subduction, special attention will devoted to the Locked and Transition Zones of the major fault separating the downgoing plate from the over-riding plate. The new 3-D model that will emerge will encompass much of the locked zone that fails in major earthquakes across Cascadia, which pose perhaps the greatest seismic hazard to the US.<br/><br/>This study focuses on the development of a 3D model of the crust and uppermost mantle to a depth of between 60 km and 100 km, depending on the maximum period of observation. The model will encompass isotropic structures as well as the radial (or polarization) and azimuthal anisotropy of shear velocities. The work will be based primarily on Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion data derived from ambient noise and earthquakes, which will be interpreted within the framework of a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion to generate a distribution of accepted models from which uncertainties will be estimated. Receiver functions and Rayleigh wave horizontal/vertical amplitude ratios will be assimilated in the inversion wherever practical. The seismological models, and the data used to construct them, will be archived and shared with the broader geoscience community.

This project addresses that mission by developing and testing computing-based science investigations for an Advanced Placement (AP) Computer Science Principles course, and for additional learning modules for use by teachers and students in middle school and high school not engaged in AP courses. The project will be implemented through a state-wide network of schools in Rhode Island having diverse student populations, and will provide professional development experiences for teachers in participating schools. The learning modules to be developed will integrate use of data and observations with computing to create conceptual models that simulate or predict natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, coastal resiliency, trends in the spread of infectious diseases, bioaccumulation of toxins in fish, the incidence of radon in homes, or other phenomena associated with emerging societal issues. <br/><br/>This design and development project will develop at least six proof-of-concept computing-based scientific investigations for use in science or computing classes. The investigations will each be grounded in the core science fields (life sciences, physical sciences, or Earth and space sciences), but the content and implications of the learning modules will span a broad range of interdisciplinary topics that focus on societal issues or potential hazards that require behavioral or engineering solutions. Each topic will require students to access data from science or engineering publications, or from national data archives maintained by agencies such as NASA, NIH, NOAA, or USGS, and incorporate these data into the development or testing of their conceptual or computer models of natural phenomena. The investigations will be aligned with performance expectations advocated by the Next Generation Science Standards for disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts, and science and engineering practices. Research questions for the project will focus on student and teacher skills in using computational thinking to understand, learn, or teach; the influence of computational thinking on attitudes toward science, engineering, and computing; and factors influencing the learning and teaching of computational thinking. The learning modules to be developed will first be piloted within AP courses having diverse student populations at three Career and Technical Centers, with subsequent implementations in schools throughout the collaboration network.

On the theoretical side, kinetic pathways are described in terms of nucleation, growth and coarsening, whose theory implies diffusion in the matrix, transfer of atoms across a matrix/precipitate interface together with the assumption of local equilibrium. The most recent achievements of high-yield atom-probe tomography (APT) and fast lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (LKMC) simulations make it possible to describe phase separation at the atomic scale. The necessary parameters for the thermodynamics and kinetics are deduced from first-principles calculations and experimental fits for the LKMC parameters. In the case of coherent precipitation, phase separation is simply the footprint left by the myriad of vacancy jumps in the inhomogeneous distribution of atomic species. Because the same vacancy jumps are at work in the equilibrium solid-solution, a link is established between features of kinetic pathways and diffusion in a solid-solution. Our APT experimental results demonstrate directly that correlation effects (flux-couplings) in solid-state diffusion control the early stage kinetic pathway for coherent-phase separation. Such effects are neglected by all extant variants of nucleation theory, which all rely on a simplified form of the diffusion matrix. We have developed a transformative approach that employs state-of-the-art APT coupled with LKMC simulations and diffusion theory for phase separation, which studies the kinetic pathways experimentally and models it via simulations and diffusion theory. And we have demonstrated the uniqueness of this approach for concentrated Ni-Al-Cr alloys. The combined use of APT and LKMC in model Ni-base superalloys provides a unique data-base (experimental and LKMC results) for developing a new theory of nucleation in binary (Ni-Al) and concentrated multi-component alloys (Ni-Al-Cr and Ni-Al-Mo). Classical nucleation theory assumes that the atomic fluxes are such that the decomposition path follows the steepest slope of the configurational free energy surface, whereas kinetic coupling of the fluxes is one reason why this isn't generally correct: also the disparate diffusivities involved is another reason. Our approach will take into account the coupled-flux effects that lead to nucleation of a second phase. In this new approach the interfacial width should be affected by the diffusion mechanism (unlike in the Cahn-Hilliard formalism). Additionally, we propose to implement a parallel LKMC simulation code for multi-component systems based on perfect time synchronicity, which is based on a code developed by Martinez et al. at LANL that will accelerate the LKMC simulations. The proposed research will lead to a completely different way of viewing kinetic pathways for phase separation of a solid-solution, and hence, nucleation, growth and coarsening.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Our unique approach to phase separation makes extensive use of a local-electrode atom-probe (LEAP) tomograph in the Northwestern University Center for Atom-Probe Tomography (NUCAPT). NUCAPT is unique university facility in the US, which has had and will have a significant impact on the research efforts of undergraduate work-study, senior thesis, research experiences for undergraduates (REU), M.S., Ph.D. and postdoctoral students: during the last four years many underrepresented groups of students have used NUCAPT. In the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Northwestern six professors and their students make extensive use of NUCAPT. Additionally, NUCAPT has users from other US universities, and both national and industrial laboratories. Research results based on atom-probe tomography are published in the archival literature and our web site, http://nucapt.northwestern.edu , has a library from which reprints can downloaded as PDF files. Through NUCAPT we have educated a large number of people in the application of atom-probe tomography to a wide range of materials science and engineering problems, which is important for characterizing materials at the subnanoscale scale. Additionally, we are interacting with a materials scientist in France on the subject matter of this research and are supplying service to industrial companies in the US and abroad. There is no one else in the US doing this to the extent that we are accomplishing this objective.","goldenrod"

This project explores the relocation of a group of indigenous migrants, and how planners develop architectures designed to permit these groups to flourish as urban indigenous subjects with distinct cultural traditions. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how such urban planning initiatives targeted at urban indigenous populations contribute to cultural and socioeconomic transformation.

The researcher will conduct research on one such urban planning project targeted at the urban indigenous population in the Taipei region, Taiwan. In Taiwan, close to 50% of the Austronesian indigenous population has settled in metropolitan areas. In 2014, Taipei's suburban municipality of New Taipei City initiated experimental projects to relocate several indigenous squatter communities located on state-owned riverbanks to newly-built ""indigenous cultural park areas."" The researcher will investigate the ideals and intentions of city officials and architects in relocating indigenous squatters to these new communities. In addition, the researcher will examine what kinds of impacts relocation to new communities might have on community residents' cultures, livelihoods, and community. The researcher will employ methods such as in-depth interviews with city officials, architects, and community residents, participant observation of community meetings and city council meetings, analysis of expert architectural knowledge, and archival research. This research will further our understanding of how urbanization is affecting indigenous communities, a topic that is poorly understood despite the fact that in many countries the majority of indigenous people today reside in urban areas. Furthermore, the research will contribute to scientific understandings of how urban planning and new built environments can have impacts on processes such as cultural change and economic marginalization.

Measurements will be comprised of: free surface elevations; near-bottom velocities (from acoustic Doppler velocimeters); sediment concentration (from vertical stacks of optical and acoustic backscatter devices); and vertical velocity profiles (via pairs of upward/downward looking pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profilers). These measurements will also be used to evaluate the dissipation of the tsunami in several different ways. To gage the degree of sediment reworking and redistribution under a tsunami, sediment samples will be analyzed using a digital-optical grain size analyzer.

First, the seismic performance will be addressed through the use of unbonded pre-tensioned columns, with the goal of re-centering the bridge after an earthquake. Second, the faster on-site construction is to be achieved through the use of pre-fabrication, which typically goes hand-in-hand with pre-tensioning. Connection details are critical, but basic configurations for them have already been developed. Third, the long-term durability is to be addressed by the use of high performance materials (hybrid fiber-reinforced concrete (HyFRC), stainless steel bars, and epoxy-coated strands) in key areas. Pilot studies have already been conducted and have shown that the system possesses the desired fundamental characteristics and has the potential to deliver the anticipated benefits. However, key aspects of the system need to be investigated, and numerical models need to be developed to investigate its dynamic performance under a wide variety of conditions. This research is a collaboration among the University of Washington, University of California at Berkeley, and University of Nevada, Reno. The testing of a two-span bridge designed with this new system will be conducted using the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) shake table facility at the University of Nevada, Reno. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse data repository at http://www.nees.org.<br/><br/>This project aims to break the limitation of achieving two out of the three long-standing ""better, faster, cheaper"" paradigm by providing three simultaneous improvements to the way that bridges are designed and built in seismic areas. The ""better"" aspect is provided by building upon basic technology that has been proven for buildings and was used to resist the seismic loads in a 40-story concrete building in San Francisco, among others. Pre-tensioning is being adapted for use in bridges, where it is being supplemented and optimized by the strategic inclusion in key regions of high performance materials, such as stainless steel and fiber-reinforced concrete, which are both selected for their toughness. Those materials will provide a quantum improvement in the response to earthquake motions by ensuring that bridges re-align properly and are open to traffic, including emergency response vehicles, immediately after an earthquake, and also by providing better long-term durability than is possible with conventional materials. The ""faster"" is achieved by the use of carefully designed pre-fabrication, which means that many components can be made off site and connected together rapidly on site. The connections must be easy to assemble but highly resistant to earthquake forces. Achieving those two goals together is challenging, but is possible due to the innovative configuration of the system. The ""cheaper"" is expected to follow from the significant reduction in construction time. Preliminary studies on individual aspects of the system have already shown their viability. This study focuses on the whole system, to optimize the arrangement and details of its components, and to create the mathematical models needed by engineers to design it in practice to reduce the cost of rebuilding the nation's aging bridge infrastructure.

Neuropeptides regulate social behaviors in representative species from all vertebrate classes. Species differences in behavior, however, have made development of clear mechanistic models difficult. This project investigates the complexity of behavioral mechanisms using a combination of animal experiments and computational models. Field and laboratory studies will be combined to address important emerging questions on neuropeptide modulation of male vertebrate behaviors. The agent-based modeling approach is especially well-suited to address this problem. Synthetic experiments with the model allow for exploration of conditions impractical or impossible in empirical tests. The model is expected to propose novel mechanisms underlying neuropeptide control of behavior. This project thus implements a tightly controlled experiment-model-experiment loop and develops a new paradigm for a systems biology approach towards understanding social behavior. Neuropeptides alter a variety of vertebrate social behaviors, including parental, aggressive, and reproductive behaviors. Conserved behaviors and chemical messengers will make the empirical results and the model broadly applicable to vertebrates. Results will significantly advance our understanding of the effect of neuropeptides on vertebrate behavioral plasticity. This project also includes a significant training component, with involvement of an undergraduate field biology class (with a 30% minority makeup) and training of graduate students in a unique inter-disciplinary environment.

This project will investigate the targets of natural selection that drive the preliminary stages of speciation between distinct populations of the wildflower Mimulus aurantiacus. Despite adaptive differences associated with their unique habitats and pollinators, few additional reproductive barriers have evolved, suggesting that these populations are at an early stage of speciation.

Much attention has focused on the loss of sea ice recorded from 2007-2012, the concomitant appearance of thousands of walruses on Alaska's and Russia's beaches, and the unfortunate consequence of large numbers of trampling mortalities. In addition, an unusual number of walruses in poor body condition were reported on Wrangel Island in 2007, many of which subsequently died. While walrus haul-out and mortality events are not historically isolated occurrences, these past haul-outs on Alaska's coasts, associated with reduced sea ice abundance, signify a change to this population. These occurrences are disquieting taken together with a decrease in estimated walrus based on surveys from 2006 versus 1990, (129,000 in 2006 compared to 200,000 in 1990), and current data on reduced fertility. The Pacific walrus is of critical importance to subsistence consumers in Alaska (and other areas of the Arctic). Despite impressive data from in-depth studies of Pacific walruses over the last 40-50 years, it is difficult to implement proposed co-management and conservation plans based on data from such a relatively short time span, much less project the impact of additional changes to the Arctic ecosystem on both walruses and humans subsisting on them.<br/><br/>This project aims to integrate several disciplines including archaeology, ethnology, biology, and ecology using diverse sources of data including DNA, stable isotope, steroid, and trace element analysis as well as to ascertain long-term trends of walrus feeding ecology, foraging location, and stock genetics over the last two millenia. This time frame includes large climatic anomalies such as the Medieval Warm and the Little Ice Age, thereby presenting scientists with the possibility of understanding how walruses adapt during times of stress and change. Present-day samples will be obtained from Alaskan subsistence hunters, historic samples will be acquired from museums, and prehistoric samples from archaeological collections. Each type of data will act as a building block to better understand walruses and how they adapt to change in Arctic ecosystems. DNA analysis will provide insights into population bottlenecks and potentially adaptive differentiation between stocks. Stable isotope analysis of bone collagen and growth ring layers of teeth will define overall feeding ecologies of individuals through time. Trace element analysis will reveal foraging locations, potential population structure, and changes of essential and non-essential elements over time. Bone steroid hormones (i.e., stress hormones) can delineate population structure and health over time, and translation of historic taped interviews and use of previously archived studies will reveal traditional knowledge of walrus habitats and feeding habits over the last 100 years.","plum"

In particular, striking changes in communities of diatoms (a type of algae that responds rapidly to environmental change and leaves a fossil in lake sediments) have occurred over the last 150 years, with species generally associated with warmer conditions increasing at unprecedented rates in the sediment record. However, changes in diatom assemblages in lake sediments from west Greenland are different from those in the rest of the Arctic in that they are rich in these 'warmer' water diatoms throughout the Holocene. This difference has raised questions about what we can use diatoms to infer in the Arctic, and suggests the need to clarify the ecological traits of key diatom taxa in order to advance our understanding of drivers of change. Recent research in alpine regions reveals that key diatom species that are used as indicators of 20th century warming in both arctic and alpine lakes respond specifically to both climate-induced changes in energy (mixing depths) and mass inputs (nutrients) to lake ecosystems. This suggests that spatially- and temporally-variable interactions between climate-induced changes in the physical and chemical structure of lakes may drive diatom community changes, but this is currently untested in arctic lakes.<br/><br/>This research will couple comparative lake sampling with both small- and large-scale experiments to provide key ecological information that will enable interpretation of climate- induced ecological changes from several existing diatom records from southwest Greenland. The objective of this project is to determine the effects of climate-driven changes in nutrients and water column stability on the relative abundances of key diatom taxa, and to apply that information to existing diatom records to determine climate-induced changes in these lake ecosystems. A suite of lakes will be sampled to determine the factors controlling the distributions of key diatom species. A small-scale experiment will be conducted to assess the importance of nutrients and incubation depth on the abundances of these key diatom species. A large-scale experiment (whole lake manipulation) will be conducted to assess the importance of thermal stratification on these diatoms, which will be tested by deepening the mixed layer of a lake that typically stratifies thermallyduring the summer. This large-scale experiment will be the first whole-lake ecosystem test of the importance of changing energy influx on the community structure of these arctic lakes.<br/><br/>This project will provide support for a postdoctoral research associate at the Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. The postdoctoral associate will gain valuable experience conducting arctic ecosystems research, mentoring undergraduate students, and working in a multidisciplinary institute focused on multiple aspects of climate change. This research will also involve two undergraduates over the course of the project. A distributed graduate seminar focused on climate change and high latitude and altitude lake ecosystems will be developed and taught in conjunction with ecologists from four countries.

This study will employ a novel combination of experimental evolution techniques and state-of-the-art molecular methods to yield unique insights into adaptive changes in the keystone marine cyanobacteria Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera in response to selection by high CO2 Several studies have suggested that N2-fixation rates of the biogeochemically-critical cyanobacteria Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera may increase dramatically in the future high CO2 ocean, but these have all used the same limited set of cultured isolates and considered cells only briefly acclimated to elevated CO2. The investigator's new results, however, demonstrate that a broad diversity of high- and low-CO2 adapted ecotypes exists within each diazotroph genus. Furthermore, in a preliminary four year experimental evolution study with Trichodesmium, the PIs observed large adaptive responses following 500-700 generations of selection by high CO2- but in a completely unexpected way. All of the six replicate high CO2-adapted cell lines exhibited strong constitutive up-regulation of N2 fixation rates. These very elevated N2 fixation rates continued, even though the cultures have were switched back to low-CO2 conditions for many months. Expression of the nif operon and N assimilatory genes was also up-regulated in these cell lines, as is expression of many intergenic regions of the genome. The investigators hypothesize that constitutive up-regulation of cellular N2 fixation systems may be a common adaptive response of both Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera under extended selection by elevated CO2. This project will test this hypothesis in a four-year experimental evolution study to determine the adaptive responses of both high- and low-CO2 specialized ecotypes of these two diazotrophs to increased CO2. The investigators will grow representative high- and low-CO2 adapted ecotypes from each genus in well-replicated cell lines at 380 ppm and 750 ppm CO2 for up to 1000 generations. Periodically, they will perform ""switch"" experiments to measure N2 and CO2 fixation rates and growth rates of high CO2-selected cell lines grown briefly (one week) at low CO2, and vice versa. These switch experiments will allow screening for cell lines which exhibit adaptive changes in phenotypically-expressed rate parameters, such as those observed in the preliminary Trichodesmium study. Evolutionary mechanisms in the CO2-selected cell lines will be examined by comparison of changes in their genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes over time relative to reference genomes, using frozen samples archived monthly during the preceding selection period. Examination of these molecular and biochemical changes will be coordinated with an in-depth array of physiological and biogeochemical analyses. This combined approach will allow an evaluation of potential adaptive mechanisms in diazotrophic cyanobacteria ranging from indel, duplication, single nucleotide polymorphism, and transposition mutations to altered putative non-coding RNA expression, protein expression, and post-translational protein modifications, and then allow the investigators to link these mechanisms directly with their potential impacts on ecosystem-level biogeochemical processes like N2 and CO2 fixation. Finally, the research team will determine how long term selection by high CO2 affects the iron and phosphorus requirements of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera, since constitutive up-regulation of N2 fixation would also have major implications for limitation of diazotrophs by these two critical nutrients in the future high CO2 ocean.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts.

This project will provide an early-career international research experience for fifteen (15) undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the Five Colleges consortium. The PI and co-PI will recruit three cohorts of students to conduct systematic, comparative research around the theme of ""Cultural Heritage in European Societies and Spaces (CHESS)"" as part of a three-year research project and training program in collaboration with the Department of Anthropological Sciences at the University of Barcelona in Spain. For each of the three years, research projects will be organized around a central research stream: highlighting specific strengths of the US and Spanish faculty: 1) ""Crisis, culture, and heritage"" (2013-2014); 2) ""Sustainable heritage, communities, and economies"" (2014-2015); and 3) ""Social Justice, heritage, and changing forms of value"" (2015-2016). Students will be trained through a course series in research design and methods, field research in Europe, and data analysis and writing for publication. International research and training workshops at the two universities will provide US students with intensive mentoring from renowned European scholars, as well as networking and collaboration with their international peers. <br/><br/>Intellectual merit: Anthropologists have critically engaged the concepts of culture and heritage for decades, but the rise of the field of heritage studies offers new opportunities for ethnographic investigation of how these central disciplinary concepts are being used by policymakers, citizens, and other social actors. By developing their projects in relation to a central set of research questions, students will contribute to three key areas of inquiry for the larger comparative investigation of culture and heritage as sites of contestation, conflict, and cohesion in Europe. The proposed CHESS program provides an integrative framework for an ethnographic field school that will draw the participation of students across the four subfields of anthropology (cultural, linguistic, archaeological, and biological) and serve as a model for interdisciplinary research teambuilding. <br/><br/>Broader impacts: Government institutions face new demands to develop public programming that reflects our nation's diverse, multicultural heritage, and there is a growing need for social scientists trained in the anthropology of heritage and related fields. Broader impacts of the project include 1) training a diverse group of fifteen (15) US students for international, comparative anthropological research on cultural heritage policies and debates, 2) developing scientific research networks between anthropologists in the US and Spain that will form the basis for further international research projects and ongoing relationships, including synergistic initiatives between the UMass Department of Anthropology, and new certificate programs in Heritage and Society Studies and Modern European Studies, the Five Colleges consortium, and European partner institutions; 3) collaborating with faculty and students from Spain to produce a body of systematic, comparative research on debates surrounding heritage management in Europe, including research reports, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, project-related theses, and multimedia case studies for use by community organizations, policymakers, and classroom instructors. These publications are available to the general public through a CHESS project website professionally archived by the UMass Amherst library. Holding an international CHESS workshop at UMass Amherst each year of the program further extends the broader impacts enabling at least 30 U.S. students to develop international professional networks, mentoring relationships, and collaborators.","chartreuse"

In addition, this study will provide further evaluation on the potential of this new thermometer to derive accurate estimates of past ocean temperatures from deep-sea coral skeletons. Funding will support an early-career junior scientist and a graduate student. <br/><br/>Despite its crucial role in modulating global climate, rates and amplitudes of environmental changes in the Southern Ocean are often difficult to constrain. In particular, the knowledge about the deep water temperatures in the Southern Ocean during the last glacial cycle is extremely limited. This results both from the lack of well-dated climate archives for the deep Southern Ocean and from the fact that most existing temperature proxies (e.g. del18O and Mg/Ca of foraminifera and corals) suffer from the biological 'vital effects'. The latter is especially problematic; it causes substantial challenges in interpreting these geochemical proxies and can lead to biases equivalent to tens of degrees in temperature estimates. Recent development of carbonate clumped isotope thermometer, holds new promises for reconstructing deep water temperatures in the Southern Ocean, since calibration studies of this thermometer in deep-sea corals suggest it is largely free of vital effects. This proposed research seeks to refine the calibration of carbonate clumped isotope thermometer in deep-sea corals at low temperatures, improve the experimental methods to obtain high precision in temperature estimates, and then apply this thermometer to a unique collection of modern and fossil deep-sea corals collected from the Drake Passage during two recent Office of Polar Programs (OPP)-funded cruises, that have already been dated by radiocarbon and U-series methods. By combining the reconstructed temperatures with the radiocarbon and U-Th ages for these deep-sea corals, this study will explore the relationships between these temperature changes and global climate changes.","plum"

Additionally precipitation is projected to become more intense, variability on all timescales stronger and significant shifts to occur in the seasonal cycles of precipitation, soil moisture and streamflow. While these projected changes will have serious implications for water resources, agriculture, rangelands, wildlife management and natural ecosystems including forests, fire, etc. it must be noted that the model simulations of radiatively-driven hydroclimate change to data are not in close accord with actual change.

Finally, the research team will determine how long term selection by high CO2 affects the iron and phosphorus requirements of Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera, since constitutive up-regulation of N2 fixation would also have major implications for limitation of diazotrophs by these two critical nutrients in the future high CO2 ocean.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts. This project will support graduate student dissertation work at USC and WHOI, as well as research activities by under-represented undergraduate biology majors. Public education and communication efforts for this project will be enhanced by an annual series of public outreach and professional colloquia sponsored by our USC-funded ""2020"" initiative intended to integrate scientific and societal responses to climate change. The biggest scientific impact of this project may well be the development of a pioneering new approach combining marine science and evolutionary biology, in order to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the adaptive responses of N2-fixing cyanobacteria and the key biogeochemical cycles that they control to changing ocean chemistry and climate","lavender"

However, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is frequently not feasible in developing evidence around the impact of many STEM practices, programs and policies. Researchers from Northwestern University examine how quasi-experimental designs that include treatment and comparison groups and outcome measures, but that do not include the random assignment to treatment and control conditions, might produce the same quality of findings as experimental designs. The researchers are also examining if pretreatment measures of study outcomes might be replaced with proxy pretests, measures in the same domain as an original pretest but in a different form, to replicate the findings from experimental studies using the original pretest. Many STEM research studies frequently have access in quasi-experimental studies for data from these proxy pretests in archival datasets, such as the state longitudinal data systems.<br/><br/>Researchers in this project have identified a number of RCTs that they use to examine whether changing the nature of the comparison group, from the original randomly assigned group, to one that is statistically adjusted from a larger population will show similar causal estimates as the original RCT. Using a within-study comparison, the researchers determine the differences in the RCT and quasi-experimental findings. They are studying the use of proxy pretreatment tests, such as math achievement data from state longitudinal data systems, to examine the extent to which these measures replicate findings in the original RCTs. They also examine the effect that modeling with a number of pre-intervention covariates has on causal estimates. If the differences between the causal estimates in the RCT and the new quasi-experimental study are low, then the quasi-experimental design is adequate to measure impact. <br/><br/>Large data sets are increasingly available in education, especially with the development of district and local data systems that expand the information gathered about students, teachers and schools. These data sets provide opportunities for research and evaluation studies that can operate with population level data rather than samples of data drawn randomly from the population. The determination of the quality of quasi-experimental evaluation designs that result from this study provides information that can be used by policy makers and researchers to study questions about educational treatments, programs and policies that have been intractable to study. Removing the potential barrier of random assignment, while still maintaining the quality of an RCT, expands the methodological toolkit of evaluators.","maroon"

In many buildings, these walls surround stairs and elevators or are located at the building perimeter. Evolution in wall design and construction practices has resulted in thinner, more efficient wall geometries that are pushing the seismic performance limits of this structural system. Indeed, poor performance in some recent earthquakes and structural engineering laboratory tests demonstrate that revisions in seismic design practices now are necessary to ensure that future construction meets the high performance expectations for modern construction. This research will explore seismic design and performance limits for structural walls, considering both conventional and innovative wall construction practices. The research will investigate: (a) mechanics models to understand poor performance of conventional construction, (b) innovative yet practical new systems that can transform design practices, (c) performance-based design limits for conventional and innovative systems, and (d) international collaborative development and interpretation of shake table tests of full-scale, three-dimensional building structures. This research is a collaborative effort among researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles and University of California at Berkeley. Primary tests will be conducted at the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) facilities at the University of California at Berkeley and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In addition, the project team will collaborate with researchers from the University of Tokyo and Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, who will conduct full-scale building tests on the E-Defense shake table facility in Miki, Japan. Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES Project Warehouse/data repository (http://www.nees.org). <br/><br/>The research program tackles an important and challenging problem that will advance discovery and understanding of one of the most common building systems used to resist earthquake forces. The results of the research will be disseminated in multiple ways: by sharing results using NEES resources, by involving earthquake professionals, and by disseminating educational materials. The results will benefit society most directly by helping define appropriate seismic design requirements for efficient and high-performance building construction. These goals will be accomplished by the active participation of the researchers with professional organizations and by utilizing an advisory board of expert engineering professionals actively involved in earthquake engineering. Graduate and undergraduate student experiences will be enhanced by active participation in research and by collaboration among the participating universities, with Japanese researchers, and interactions with design professionals.

The NDPSS is a social indicators, infrastructure, and data dissemination program. It gathers data to (1) monitor and explain trends, changes and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes and examine the structure and functioning of society in general, as well as the role of various sub-groups; (2) compare the United States to other societies, by developing cross-national models of human society; and (3) make high quality data easily accessible to scholars, students, and others with minimal cost and waiting. The GSS is a regular, ongoing interview survey of U.S households. The mission of the GSS is to make timely high-quality scientifically relevant data available to social science researchers. Since 1972 the GSS (with NSF support) has conducted 28 in-person, cross-sectional surveys of the adult household population of the U S with approximately 55,087 respondents. GSS content is wide ranging with approximately 5,416 variables overall. The ISSP facilitates cross-national research in 48 nations that use data collection programs modeled on the GSS. <br/><br/>The NDPSS has been collecting high quality, full-probability data in the United States since 1972 and cross-national data since 1982. Using the most scientifically rigorous of survey designs, the GSS is widely acknowledged to represent the ""gold standard"" in contemporary survey research. The GSS/ISSP surveys monitor societal change in the United States and place American society in comparative perspective. These data are used to develop and test models of societal change and other social processes. The GSS and ISSP have contributed to advancing knowledge of age-period-cohort effects; changes in intergroup relations, gender roles, family structure and values, attitudes about civil liberties; the impact of globalization on national identity; and other social and political aspects of society. The renewal proposal supports several enhancements, upgrades and innovations to the GSS. These include 1) the updating of the sample frame, 2) the linkage of GSS cases to the National Death Index, 3) the expansion of auxiliary and aggregate-level data, 4) adding new design-effects variables, 5) additional hypernetwork samples of congregations and employers, 6) updating coding of occupation and industry and a new measurement of occupational prestige, 7) expanding the ISSP and cross-national research methods, 8) adding new modules on social media use and technological change, and 9) analyzing the GSS panel data to study gross and net change and clarify causal connections, <br/><br/>Broader Impacts <br/><br/>The NDPSS has already had enormous impact beyond the boundaries of the survey itself. The GSS is held as the ""gold standard"" by which many other survey data collection activities are measured, and the ISSP program has led to innovations and developments in cross-cultural and cross-national research. The user community includes researchers, college and university faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, business planners, the media and public officials. Sociologists, political scientists, economists, statisticians, survey methodologists, anthropologists, geographers, biologists, engineers, psychologists, criminologist, legal scholars, medical/health researchers, and business administration and management scholars use GSS data. The GSS is widely disseminated and easily accessible, supporting research and education of groups that are traditionally under-represented in the conduct of social scientific research. The use of the GSS is widely documented in publications, with over 20,000 publications citing the use of GSS data. The GSS uses a state-of-the-art interview-to-internet archiving and dissemination system that speeds access to the interview data and allows users to access all information associated with each variable in a database. The contributions of the GSS to the teaching of quantitative social science analysis are unprecedented and unmatched. Its accessibility and ease of use has added value far beyond the original data collection efforts, and researchers continue to mine both the old and new data to advance knowledge and test theories. The GSS and ISSP program are part of the core infrastructure of social science research in the U.S.","crimson"

The mechanical stimulus is perceived and processed by cells and tissues through a highly complicated process regulated by a large number of biomolecules, subcellular components and extracellular structures, which eventually leads to appropriate biochemical responses. Understanding mechanotransduction requires engineering devices that can provide in situ assessment, in a controlled environment, of the cell response to systematically variable external mechanical stimuli mimicking the combinatorial mechanical loads (compressive/tensile) found in vivo.<br/><br/>In this CAREER project, fully automated cellular mechanotransduction analysis will be streamlined through the development of an integrated micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS). The device will simplify the analysis of cells and tissues by minimizing external influence and will provide direct correlation between an applied mechanical stimulus and the activity of critical mechanosensitive biomolecules. The device will enable application of independently controllable combinational mechanical signals with preferred magnitudes, frequency, and duration to cells on loading sites. The use of a microfluidic network will allow parallel actuation of a large number of cells, and in situ intercellular and intracellular analysis. Use of the device will be simplified by developing instrumental and software interfaces. The efficacy of the device will be evaluated using skeletal myoblasts C2C12. By enabling quantitative study mechanotrandcution pathways, the device will help in the study of mechanisms that govern physiologic and pathologic conditions of mechanosensitive cells.<br/><br/>The CAREER project will integrate the PI's research, education and outreach activities. The research outcome will be incorporated into courses and laboratory modules, benefitting students from both engineering fields and biology. The research discoveries will be disseminated through archival journals and conference presentations. Meanwhile, the research will provide a vehicle to deliver math, technological and engineering science in an exciting, practical, and interactive environment to minority and women students through the institutional Engineers in Motion program, and to K-12 students through collaboration with a local high school.<br/><br/>The project outcome will also be available at the lab website http://www.bme.ohio-state.edu/yizhao/.","puce"

The Center?s vision is to understand and predict the role of polar ice sheets in sea level change. In particular, the Center?s mission is to develop technologies, to conduct field investigations, to compile data to understand why many outlet glaciers and ice streams are changing rapidly, and to develop models that explain and predict ice sheet response to climate change. The Center?s mission is also to educate and train a diverse population of graduate and undergraduate students in Center-related disciplines and to encourage K-12 students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM-fields). The long-term goals are to perform a four-dimensional characterization (space and time) of rapidly changing ice-sheet regions, develop diagnostic and predictive ice-sheet models, and contribute to future assessments of sea level change in a warming climate. In the first five years, significant progress was made in developing, testing and optimizing innovative sensors and platforms and completing a major aircraft campaign, which included sounding the channel under Jakobshavn Isbrï¿½. In the second five years, research will focus on the interpretation of integrated data from a suite of sensors to understand the physical processes causing changes and the subsequent development and validation of models. Information about CReSIS can be found at http://www.cresis.ku.edu.<br/><br/>The intellectual merits of the STC are the multidisciplinary research it enables its faculty, staff and students to pursue, as well as the broad education and training opportunities it provides to students at all levels. During the first phase, the Center provided scientists and engineers with a collaborative research environment and the opportunity to interact, enabling the development of high-sensitivity radars integrated with several airborne platforms and innovative seismic instruments. Also, the Center successfully collected data on ice thickness and bed conditions, key variables in the study of ice dynamics and the development of models, for three major fast-flowing glaciers in Greenland. During the second phase, the Center will collect additional data over targeted sites in areas undergoing rapid changes; process, analyze and interpret collected data; and develop advanced process-oriented and ice sheet models to predict future behavior. The Center will continue to provide a rich environment for multidisciplinary education and mentoring for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, as well as for conducting K-12 education and public outreach. The broader impacts of the Center stem from addressing a global environmental problem with critical societal implications, providing a forum for citizens and policymakers to become informed about climate change issues, training the next generation of scientists and engineers to serve the nation, encouraging underrepresented students to pursue careers in STEM-related fields, and transferring new technologies to industry. Students involved in the Center find an intellectually stimulating atmosphere where collaboration between disciplines is the norm and exposure to a wide variety of methodologies and scientific issues enriches their educational experience. The next generation of researchers should reflect the diversity of our society; the Center will therefore continue its work with ECSU to conduct outreach and educational programs that attract minority students to careers in science and technology. The Center has also established a new partnership with ADMI that supports faculty and student exchanges at the national level and provides expanded opportunities for students and faculty to be involved in Center-related research and education activities. These, and other collaborations, will provide broader opportunities to encourage underrepresented students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>As lead institution, The University of Kansas (KU) provides overall direction and management, as well as expertise in radar and remote sensing, Uninhabited Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and modeling and interpretation of data. Five partner institutions and a DOE laboratory play critical roles in the STC. The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) continues to participate in technology development for seismic measurements, field activities, and modeling. The Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing, Education and Research (CERSER) at Elizabeth City State University (ECSU) contributes its expertise to analyzing satellite data and generating high-level data products. ECSU also brings to the Center their extensive experience in mentoring and educating traditionally under-represented students. ADMI, the Association of Computer and Information Science/Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions, expands the program?s reach to underrepresented groups at the national level. Indiana University (IU) provides world-class expertise in CI and high-performance computing to address challenges in data management, processing, distribution and archival, as well as high-performance modeling requirements. The University of Washington (UW) provides expertise in satellite observations of ice sheets and process-oriented interpretation and model development. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) contributes in the area of ice sheet modeling. All partner institutions are actively involved in the analysis and interpretation of observational and numerical data sets.","plum"

By assessing the nature and extent of SISS, the PIs are able to build a sea-ice observing network that is responsive to the needs of both the scientific community and key stakeholders. SIZONet builds on collaboration with several international partners, and spans the entire latitudinal extent of the Arctic seasonal ice zone (SIZ). Based on common protocol and coordinated observation strategies developed in the context of an international working group led by the project team, SIZONet Phase II refines and narrows the scope of the project and focuses on sustaining core observations. The aim is to provide data and information to scientists and stakeholders that: (1) address the most urgent information needs identified by the Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) and related efforts; (2) meet sea-ice user information needs, centering on access, use of ice as a platform, and ice as coastal hazard and regulator of coastal erosion; (3) contribute to development of down-scaling approaches for climate modeling and remote sensing; and (4) are directly tied to SISS, allowing existing collaborations to grow into partnerships that can help track and predict Arctic environmental change and meet long-term information needs.<br/><br/>Observations include shore-based and drift-ice measurements of ice motion, key mass-balance variables and critical snow and ice properties such as albedo, as well as airborne ice thickness and property surveys. Measurements in coastal ice, of greatest interest to key stakeholders, include hydrographic moorings, survey measurements and integration of satellite imagery. Local ice observations and joint ice-trail mapping provide a link between sea-ice geophysics and indigenous sea-ice expertise.

Comets are remnants from the early solar system that retain the volatiles (ices) from the cold outer protoplanetary disk where they formed. The proposing team will characterize the cometary volatile composition in the near-infrared spectral domain, simultaneously searching for a number of parent molecules via multiple spectral lines of each species; these parent molecules include water, oxidized carbon compounds, symmetric hydrocarbons, and nitriles. They will also conduct complementary searches for deuterated water and deuterated methane in order to constrain the deutrerium-to-hydrogen ratio. The observations will help constrain chemical formation pathways for water and pre-biotic organic molecules in cometary ices, the evolution of volatile matter in the early Solar System, and exogenous delivery of water and pre-biotic molecules to Earth. The project will support undergraduate research and enable student participation in professional astronomical observing runs and in local and national conferences.

These spectra, however, are affected by many sources of noise that block these signal changes from being detected. Astronomers aim to develop ways of separating the signals of the exoplanets from the sources of noise. The hardest stellar noise to identify and remove is caused by spots that change with time on the star's surface. These investigators will look for differences between the signals of passing planets and signals of the surface spots on the star, and use these differences to create computer programs that can detect the differences. The investigators will create false data that can be used to test their programs. If successful, they will then apply these software tools to search data from space-based and ground-based telescopes, where they expect to find hundreds of Earth-like planets. This research serves the national interest by developing and applying new tools to detect planets that could harbor life. The techniques that are developed as part of this research will be included in classes and research at the university level.<br/><br/><br/>Astronomers are now searching for analogs of the Earth. Significant progress has been made in the development of more stable and higher resolution spectrometers with the potential to deliver precision sufficient to detect Earth analogs. However, stellar spectra are laced with quasi-periodic signals that arise from stellar photospheres: granulation, oscillations, spots and plage on rotating stars, and meridional flows. The most challenging of these stellar noise signals for exoplanet detection are spots and plage. The investigators propose to search systematically for differences between Doppler shifts from planets and the photospheric signals from spots and plage. They will use blind source separation techniques with principal component analysis, independent component analysis, dictionary learning algorithms, and multivariate Gaussian process modeling. A large library of simulated data will be created and used to verify the efficacy of the statistical tools for distinguishing Doppler shifts from photospheric noise sources. After validation, the most promising algorithms will be applied to real data from space-based and multiple ground-based telescopes. If signals of the level detected by the spaceborne Kepler telescope can be extracted in the presence of background noise sources, hundreds of Earth-like planets will be detected. The statistical techniques that are developed as part of this research will be incorporated into classes and research at the university level.","lime"

Astrophysicists can virtually look back in time by examining some of the most distant galaxies in the Universe, whose light has taken billions of years to reach Earth. Detailed, careful study of these very distant galaxies is critical to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify these galaxies. This project aims to use a new technique that exploits gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies that magnify these distant galaxies, making them easier to detect.<br/><br/>The principal investigators' (PIs') new theoretical framework for analyzing multiple-lensing planes reveals that there are mass distributions consisting of multiple structures along the line-of-sight and large integrated masses that produce a many-fold increase in the number of lensed z > ~7 sources, particularly at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. These beams are effective because they create significant magnification over a large area, or high etendue. Cosmological simulations suggest that they are rare but identifiable by choosing lines-of-sight with the highest integrated luminosities of galaxies that trace the densest structures, i.e., luminous red galaxies. The PIs have now identified 40 such lines-of-sight in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Spectroscopy of the first seven confirms that they are likely the most powerful gravitational lens telescopes in the sky. This project will use a comprehensive observational and theoretical program to enable highly efficient ground- and space-based follow-up surveys for lensed z ~ 7 to 10 sources. Using galaxy spectroscopy and lensed arc imaging to constrain each line-of-sight mass distribution, coupled with theoretical modeling to generate a precise lensing magnification map, the PIs will place the first limits on the faint end luminosity evolution of the most distant galaxies.<br/><br/>This work will advance the training of graduate students at The University of Arizona and Rutgers University by allowing them to work with senior personnel on forefront observational analyses and theoretical modeling.

This project is an integrated program of observational and theoretical studies designed to determine the distribution of both dark and luminous matter within a large sample of spiral galaxies and to compare these measurements with the predictions of galaxy formation in the concordance cosmological model.<br/><br/>Using the wide-field spectroscopic imaging Fabry-Perot instrument on the Southern African Large Telescope, the investigators propose to obtain high-resolution velocity maps of the galaxies, supplemented with more extended but lower resolution 21-cm maps from the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and, later, MeerKAT (Karoo Array Telescope). Combined with optical and near-infrared surface photometry, these data will be the basis for measurement of the total mass distribution within each galaxy. Stellar population synthesis estimates and detailed hydrodynamical modeling will determine the separation into baryonic and dark matter components. Extensive N-body simulations will test the stability of the models, sharpening the determination of the separate contributions of luminous and dark matter. After correction for the gravitational compression by the baryonic disk, the density, concentration, and circular speed of these halo models will be compared to the expected values derived from cosmological simulations. Discrepancies may suggest ways to improve and extend the physics in the galaxy formation simulations. A new analysis tool will measure non-axisymmetric patterns of motion in the two-dimensional kinematic maps of the galaxies, leading to a determination of the shapes of the dark halos. The investigators will also use Fabry-Perot observations of stellar absorption lines in early-type barred disk galaxies to determine the bar's rotation speed. As dynamical friction with the halo slows the bar's motion, this measurement will yield another constraint on the halo density in these galaxies. Sharpened by dynamical constraints, estimates for the mass-to-light ratios of galaxies aim to refine the poorly-known relation between mass-to-light and broad-band colors of disk galaxies.<br/><br/>Educationally, the proposing team will disseminate their results to the broader community through public lectures and in New Jersey schools.

Spectroscopic observations of the surface, whether from in situ spacecraft or Earth-based telescopes, are complicated by Titan's thick atmosphere, through which the light must traverse, and the composition and structure of which are poorly known. The key element of this project is the observation of a grazing-angle specular reflection of the Sun from one of Titan's hydrocarbon lakes by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on the Cassini spacecraft. The Principal Investigator (PI) intends to exploit the wavelength independence of the specular reflection to isolate the atmospheric contributions to the total spectrum. The proposed work consists of three specific tasks: (1) to explore the composition of Titan's polar atmosphere using the transmission spectrum obtained from the specular reflection; (2) to constrain the composition of possible surface organic species using VIMS spectra in the 5-micron transmission window corrected for atmospheric effects, and (3) to map the extent of surface water ice exposures using the corrected spectra.

Such studies are necessary to improve our understanding of the physical processes in galaxy formation and galactic chemical evolution. The primary focus for near-term applications is to use data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey, which is a follow-up survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III). This survey will measure precise radial velocities and multi-element chemistry (about 15 elements per star) for about 100,000 red giant stars in all regions of the Milky Way. Other target data sets include the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration survey (SEGUE, another follow up survey to SDSS), and the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey of the solar neighborhood, but also data from other large surveys planned in the future .The research employs three complementary modeling approaches: Analytic chemical evolution models that incorporate radial mixing and dynamical processes, N-body/hydrodynamic simulations that model growth of a galaxy disk either in isolation or in the presence of accreting satellite galaxies, and simulations of galactic disk formation from fully cosmological initial conditions. The growing disk simulations use the Gasoline code, which is also used in the cosmological runs, but gas is added to the disk as a prescribed function of radius and time. This approach provides controlled simulations that can isolate the effects of specific physical processes, and realize distinct scenarios that can be used to distinguish processes such as galactic bulge formation by secular evolution versus formation through minor mergers. The investigators will develop and apply the technique of Principal Component Abundance Analysis (PCAA) to characterize any correlated variations of elemental abundances in large stellar data sets. The PCAA tool will be a valuable tool for understanding systematic effects and statistical errors in the APOGEE chemical abundance data and for characterizing its multi-dimensional measurements in compact form. This and other tools are likely to increase the impact of the SDSS-III data sets. For example, by applying these tools to the interpretation of APOGEE and other data sets, the investigators can address questions about the origin of the Galactic thick disk, bulge, and stellar halo, and the history of chemical enrichment and migration of stars within the thin disk. The PCAA and data-model comparisons are used to analyze the distribution of stellar chemical compositions as a function of metallicity and spatial location, and to characterize the level of chemo-dynamical substructure in different components of the Galaxy. This can constrain the importance of satellite perturbations and mergers, and by identifying the principal patterns of enrichment and rare outliers from these patterns, one can gain insights insight into the key pathways of stellar nucleosynthesis. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are involved in this project and will be trained in developing and applying theory, observation, and statistical analysis tools to problems in Galaxy formation and evolution.","lime"

Bombardment by large objects may have had fundamental effects on our Earth, including possibly bringing the molecules that are necessary for life. On Earth, it is rare to see the evidence of these impacts because of the constant changes to its surface due to geological (e.g. earthquakes and volcanic eruptions) and meteorological (e.g. wind and rain) processes. However, the Moon, due to its nearness to Earth, serves as a good substitute for understanding terrestrial impact events. But the timing of impacts on the Moon over the last 4500 million years is not well understood. This study will examine samples of lunar material affected by the bombardment that were brought back by the Apollo missions to try and determine how when they were formed and what they are made of. This will help us determine what kinds of objects hit the earth, and when, potentially providing insights into their influence on Earth's evolution.<br/><br/>The PI resides at a predominantly undergraduate college, and will involve her students in studying the samples and their data so that they will learn how to manage and think critically about large data sets. She will also bring students to the annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference to present their results. Thus, they will develop skills that will benefit them in graduate school or the workforce, and their involvement in inquiry-based learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields achieves a key aspect of the National Science Foundation's mission. Furthermore, students who work with the lunar samples and their data will become knowledgeable about extraterrestrial sample characterization and may be poised to be some of the best-prepared graduate students available to work on any samples returned from both the Moon and Mars in the next ~20 years. <br/><br/>The Moon provides the most clear and complete history of impact events in the inner Solar System.

The timing of impacts on the Moon, however, is not well understood and has been the focus of many studies. Deciphering the lunar impact history is a complex process and lunar impact glasses, numerous in the regolith samples returned with the Apollo missions, can be used to address this issue. This study focuses on obtaining geochemical and geochronological data on lunar impact glasses, which are pieces of melted regolith (lunar dirt) created by energetic impacting events on the Moon. These impact glasses possess the composition of the target material and can be dated by the 40Ar/39Ar (argon) method in order to determine their age of formation, how long they have been exposed at the lunar surface, and the composition of the solar wind prior to the time of burial. The study's objective is to understand the ages of impact glasses, along with their compositions, in order to learn more about Solar System processes. In particular, team can begin to piece together information about the rate of impact events and their effects (if any) on Earth, as well as the changing nature (if any) of the solar wind composition.","lime"

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies and how these black holes interact with their host galaxies. Observational evidence suggests that black holes and galaxies evolve together. This evidence includes the tightness of the correlation between the black hole mass and galaxy bulge properties and the similar history of black hole growth and star formation. This evidence is supported by theoretical arguments. Black holes in their active phase emit more than enough energy to unbind the host galaxies' bulge, and in their non-active phase should be present in the centers of most present-day galaxies. As a consequence, many models for galaxy formation include a unspecified process by which a fraction of the energy released in the region surrounding the black hole contributes to the galaxy formation environment. This interaction is generically known as ""feedback,"" and the mechanism by which the black hole acts on the host galaxy remains a mystery. This project uses a novel spectral synthesis and statistical approach to build the tools needed to constrain the key parameter characterizing one type of feedback.<br/><br/>In addition, the project activities will directly contribute to the training of young scientists, including undergraduate students, in techniques of spectral and statistical analysis.

The assembly history of a galaxy is imprinted in its detailed morphology, but current quantitative classification schemes are only useful for broad binning. Thus, the comparison of observations with theoretical predictions has only used small samples of visually classified galaxies. Coping with the large samples needed to disentangle the complex physics involved requires a robust quantitative classification scheme. This study will implement a promising machine learning algorithm that has proven successful at identifying bars, single-armed or multi-armed galaxies, rings and Hubble type. The project will: determine a robust quantitative classification and apply it to multiple ground and space based data sets; study the dependence of bars, rings and spiral arms on properties such as mass, star formation, environment and redshift; determine triggering and destruction mechanisms of bars and spiral arms; compare observed trends to those of simulated galaxies; and apply this robust classification scheme to 3D data cubes to compare stellar, gas and kinematic morphologies. The work for countering the underrepresentation of women and minorities in STEM fields includes more frequent public observing nights, buying a portable planetarium to encourage daytime visits by university and school students, creating planetarium-based lecture-tutorials and interactive demonstrations for teachers and pupils, and arranging discussions with former physics majors about alternate career pathways.","lime"

This course links students to Space Port America and the growing aerospace and tourism industry rapidly growing in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Special emphasis is placed on forging STEM related opportunities for minority students, which comprise 45% of New Mexico State's student population. Two graduate students will be supported in New Mexico. PI Charlton plans to transform her successful science fiction, interactive, web astronomy course into a video game to teach K--12 students, while achieving STEM astronomy standards for the state of Pennsylvania. This project will support two pre-selected skilled and talented students to construct the game and integrate it into local schools. One graduate student will be supported in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The CGM is understood through observations and analysis of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars. However, being blind to the actual properties of the absorbing gas, present day analysis methods are uncalibrated. That is, our cumulative knowledge of the CGM and its role in galaxy evolution is based upon a host of implicit and explicit assumptions that remain untested or quantified. Using the Eulerian hydrodynamic N-body cosmological simulation code hydroART, the team will use the quasar absorption line technique, coupled with direct analysis of the simulations, to study highly-detailed simulated galaxies with various star formation and feedback physical models. The galaxies will range in viral halo mass from 10.5 < log(M/Msun) < 12.5 and in redshift from z ~ 0-3. The team aims to address these questions: (1) What is the relationship between the gas phase structures in and surrounding galaxies and the physical model for star formation and stellar feedback? (2) How well do models that yield galaxies matching global galaxy properties also match the observed properties of the gaseous reservoirs? (3) How does the CGM regulate the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution? (4) Do current analysis methods of absorption lines yield inferred gas properties (metallicities, spatial-kinematics distributions, gas phases, and gas reservoir masses) that are consistent with the gas being probed in the simulations? (5) What are the quantitative relationships between inferred gas properties from observational analysis and the gas actually giving rise to the absorption? (6) What are the implications and how do they change our understanding of the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution?","lime"

A nova is a star that brightens abruptly by a large factor. Some novae may become as much as tens of thousands of times brighter than our Sun. The rapid brightening is caused by a runaway thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a white dwarf star; a small star that packs about as much mass as our Sun into a volume the size of Earth. The white dwarf accumulates the hydrogen that fuels the nova outburst from an ordinary star that is a close companion. The explosion ejects mass from the surface of the white dwarf, enriching space with heavier elements produced during the thermonuclear explosion. Although novae have been known since ancient times, and astrophysicists have understood the cause of a nova explosion since the middle of the last century, important puzzles still remain. Over the past several years, spacecraft observations have revealed that at least some novae emit very high-energy gamma radiation. This was unexpected and is still mysterious. Some novae also may be progenitors of Type Ia supernovae, which have significant implications for cosmology. The Principal Investigator will conduct extensive scientific analyses of the atlas of observational data he has accumulated for 83 novae over the past 14 years. This research will address several key questions about novae. The results of the investigations constitute the Intellectual Merit of this project.

Nova eruptions are caused by thermonuclear runaways at the degenerate base of an accreted H layer on a white dwarf. The hydrogen layer is accumulated by mass transfer from a close binary companion star. During outburst, a nova increases in brightness, in some cases reaching tens of thousands of times the luminosity of the Sun. A nova explosion ejects as much one ten-thousandth of a solar mass from the white dwarf into the interstellar medium, enriching it in heavier elements produced in the nuclear burning event. During the past several years, the Fermi Gamma Ray Observatory has discovered that some novae emit high-energy gamma radiation; the origin of these emissions is still not well understood. Some novae also may be the precursors of Type Ia supernovae, which have important implications for cosmology.

Most of what we know about the outer halo is learned from stars that happen to pass nearby. If the outer halo is, as we expect, dynamically young and not well mixed, the motion of such stars may not tell the full story of the recent accretion history of the Galaxy. Dr. Rockosi (at the University of California Santa Cruz) and Dr. Morrison (at Case Western Reserve University)work on a spectroscopic survey of red giant branch stars in the outer halo, done as part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This is the dark time survey in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III project. The BOSS spectrograph improvements and large area coverage of an area of about 10,000 square degrees allow a contiguous survey of the outer reaches of our Galaxy. The complete sample will provide kinematics, metallicities, and alpha element to iron abundance ratios for approximately 1000 stars with a median distance of 50 kpc, providing a true outer halo sample. The alpha elements such as O, Mg, and Si are mainly produced in supernovae and trace the chemical evolution of the halo. <br/>The outer halo sample will be used to measure the halo stellar radial density profile, metallicity and alpha element abundance gradients to beyond 100 kpc from the center of the Galaxy, as well as identify and characterize substructure in stellar density, kinematics and chemical abundance. From this we can learn the fractional contribution of stellar accretion to the outer halo, as well as the mass and orbit distributions and star formation histories of the halo progenitors. Comparison of these measurements in the outer halo to existing measurements in the surviving dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in the inner halo can be used to infer the mass accretion history and stellar population evolution of our Galaxy and its progenitors through time. All SDSS data become public in a timely manner, giving a rich and in many ways still unexplored resource to astronomers. The principal investigators have led the stellar surveys in the SDSS projects from proposals through data releases. All have been actively involved for the past six years in the calibrations needed before these data can be used reliably for stars, which included improving the flux calibration of the SDSS spectra, to tests of the stellar parameters pipeline to the painstaking observation and analysis of well-studied open and globular clusters.<br/>Minority students remain a small proportion of graduating PhDs.

The Case program for Women in Science and Engineering (co-founded by the PI) is now in its ninth year of encouraging women undergraduates to stay in science. Dr. Rockosi leads many projects to develop facility instrumentation at Keck and Lick Observatory. These instruments are available via public access to Keck, and the Lick Observatory projects provide a technology development platform for adaptive optics and other instrumentation research. Dr. Rockosi and her research group participate in the Santa Cruz Institute for Science and Engineering Educators, which introduces graduate students and postdocs to inquiry-based learning techniques while running workshops designed to encourage underrepresented minority students to go on for advanced degrees in STEM fields.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and how these SMBHs are linked to their host galaxies. Another major question in astrophysics involves the concept of ""dark matter,"" an unidentified type of matter believed to have the properties of gravitation but not to emit any light (hence, ""dark""). Thereby addressing two major astrophysical problems, this project aims to link SMBHs to the dark matter structure of their host galaxies.<br/><br/>All-sky surveys with the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) satellite have now produced groundbreaking data sets, which are used together to obtain constraints on the evolution of structure in the Universe. WISE uncovered millions of the previously ""hidden"" obscured quasars, rapidly growing supermassive black holes that are shrouded in gas and dust and so are not detectable using traditional ground-based optical and near-IR techniques. Recently, Planck produced the most precise all-sky map to date of dark matter structures via the lensing of the CMB. This project will combine these data sets along with ground-based imaging and spectroscopy to obtain a uniquely powerful measurement of the link between rapidly growing black holes and their host dark matter structures by cross-correlating the density field of WISE-selected quasars with the CMB lensing convergence maps obtained from Planck.<br/><br/>In addition, this project will use astronomy to build problem-solving intuition in students through order-of-magnitude (OOM) estimation, or ""Fermi Problems."" Building on successful OOM activities in introductory astronomy courses at Dartmouth College, the investigators will develop OOM exercises for use at the middle, high school, and undergraduate levels, in which real-world estimation problems are combined with more abstract questions based on astronomical concepts. The investigators will organize workshops in which teacher participants learn to incorporate OOM activities in their classrooms and help develop new OOM exercises. Both Dartmouth and the University of Wyoming are located in rural areas, and the investigators will focus on under-resourced schools. By developing OOM exercises and instructing teachers in implementing them in their classrooms, this project will serve to foster students' problem-solving intuition. These skills are particularly useful when applying scientific or mathematical thinking to real-world problems, and success in problem solving will help create enthusiasm and future opportunities for students in STEM. The exercises and teacher reference materials produced by this program will be disseminated to the wider educational community via the web, conferences, and publications, providing a resource for all interested instructors at multiple levels to incorporate OOM activities into their classrooms.<br/><br/>This project will (1) produce the first all-sky measurement of quasar clustering bias using the WISE and Planck data, and (2) directly compare the halo masses of obscured and unobscured quasars, using wide-area deep optical imaging from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and SDSS, and measure the evolution of those biases with redshift, using a technique independent of spatial clustering. This project will enable a significant step forward in our understanding of the cosmic evolution of black holes and their host halos, and will yield valuable tools for future studies with WISE, Planck, and upcoming ground-based surveys.","lime"

The shapes and colors of galaxies provide important insight into how and when galaxies formed their stars and merged to become larger galaxies. Dr. Lotz and team will devise innovative software tools to measure the structures of thousands of nearby galaxies, and compare the distribution of shapes of today's galaxies to distant ones observed as they were ~10 billion years ago. By tracking the metamorphosis of galaxy shapes over cosmic time, and by comparing with simulations of galaxy evolution, the project will illuminate the physical processes governing the evolution of galaxies like our own Milky Way. The tools developed by this project will help to fully exploit future astronomy surveys with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. Besides its scientific significance, the project will support the training of a postdoctoral fellow, and the education of a graduate student and a Baltimore-city high school student. The broader public will be engaged through a related citizen science project to study galaxy images. <br/><br/>The stellar and gaseous structures of galaxies provide direct insight into their most recent assembly events, as well as longer timescale internal secular processes, both of which drive galaxy star-formation and quenching. However, the existing coarse structural classifications fail to capture the complex assembly processes responsible for the morphological transformation of galaxies over the past 10 billion years. Building upon working currently being done for redshifts 0.5<z<3, this project will develop new non-parametric, quantitative measures of galaxy structure, identifying galaxy mergers and classifying galaxy morphology, and apply this approach to nearby galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Optical Galaxy Survey. This low-redshift baseline will be compared to high-redshift observations by the Hubble Space Telescope to track the emergence of spheroidal galaxies and the frequency of different types of galaxy mergers over time. In concert with this observational analysis, the investigators will statistically compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from Illustris to the distribution and evolution of morphologies of observed galaxies at redshifts 0<z<3; this will provide physical insights into the measured structural quantities and distributions, and place constraints on the viable modes for galaxy assembly and evolution.","lime"

Most of what we know about the outer halo is learned from stars that happen to pass nearby. If the outer halo is, as we expect, dynamically young and not well mixed, the motion of such stars may not tell the full story of the recent accretion history of the Galaxy. Dr. Rockosi (at the University of California Santa Cruz) and Dr. Morrison (at Case Western Reserve University)work on a spectroscopic survey of red giant branch stars in the outer halo, done as part of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This is the dark time survey in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)-III project. The BOSS spectrograph improvements and large area coverage of an area of about 10,000 square degrees allow a contiguous survey of the outer reaches of our Galaxy. The complete sample will provide kinematics, metallicities, and alpha element to iron abundance ratios for approximately 1000 stars with a median distance of 50 kpc, providing a true outer halo sample. The alpha elements such as O, Mg, and Si are mainly produced in supernovae and trace the chemical evolution of the halo. <br/>The outer halo sample will be used to measure the halo stellar radial density profile, metallicity and alpha element abundance gradients to beyond 100 kpc from the center of the Galaxy, as well as identify and characterize substructure in stellar density, kinematics and chemical abundance. From this we can learn the fractional contribution of stellar accretion to the outer halo, as well as the mass and orbit distributions and star formation histories of the halo progenitors. Comparison of these measurements in the outer halo to existing measurements in the surviving dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in the inner halo can be used to infer the mass accretion history and stellar population evolution of our Galaxy and its progenitors through time. All SDSS data become public in a timely manner, giving a rich and in many ways still unexplored resource to astronomers. The principal investigators have led the stellar surveys in the SDSS projects from proposals through data releases. All have been actively involved for the past six years in the calibrations needed before these data can be used reliably for stars, which included improving the flux calibration of the SDSS spectra, to tests of the stellar parameters pipeline to the painstaking observation and analysis of well-studied open and globular clusters. <br/>Minority students remain a small proportion of graduating PhDs. Case astronomy is partnering with the very successful Fisk/Vanderbilt Masters Bridge Program for minorities so that their graduates can enter the Case Western Reserve University astronomy PhD program in the same way that they currently enter the Vanderbilt PhD program; effectively as third-year graduate students. The Case program for Women in Science and Engineering (co-founded by the PI) is now in its ninth year of encouraging women undergraduates to stay in science. Dr. Rockosi leads many projects to develop facility instrumentation at Keck and Lick Observatory. These instruments are available via public access to Keck, and the Lick Observatory projects provide a technology development platform for adaptive optics and other instrumentation research. Dr. Rockosi and her research group participate in the Santa Cruz Institute for Science and Engineering Educators, which introduces graduate students and postdocs to inquiry-based learning techniques while running workshops designed to encourage underrepresented minority students to go on for advanced degrees in STEM fields.

The new, NSF-funded, Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I telescope represents a major development for the study of these galaxies, offering increases in sensitivity and survey efficiency by factors of approximately 5 and 100, respectively. This project, the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) Survey, will chart the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for approximately 2000 galaxies between 1.5 and 3.5, more than an order of magnitude improvement over existing surveys. The project will make use of 44 nights allocated on the Keck I telescope through 2016, and will survey three well-studied regions of the sky already having extensive multi-wavelength datasets. By combining new and existing data, the proposing team will characterize the star formation and accreting black hole activity in distant galaxies, their masses, contents and structures, and the manner in which baryonic matter passes through them. In collaboration with theorists, the MOSDEF team will use these results to test and inform forefront models of galaxy evolution. The MOSDEF spectra will be publicly released to the astronomical community to enable additional investigations.

Until recently, resources were sufficiently limited that only selected populations could be extensively monitored in the time domain, but modern telescopes and detectors can survey cosmic volumes much more quickly than before. As a consequence, synoptic time-domain astronomy - the study of cosmic variability across sizeable populations - is becoming a dominant mode of study. Such surveys provide not simply more data, but a different kind of data, requiring a new approach to statistical learning capable of extracting information from large ensembles of multivariate, irregularly and asynchronously sampled light curves. Astronomy is not the only discipline facing this change in the nature of data. Functional data analysis (FDA) is a rapidly growing area of statistics that addresses inference from datasets that sample ensembles of related functions. The present interdisciplinary project will use FDA concepts and techniques to develop new methods to address several problem areas of survey data analysis, from astrophysical modeling of variability using catalog data, to the detection of variable and transient sources in images. One main application will be the analysis of light curves of periodic variable stars using functional mixed effects models. In particular, Cepheid variable stars are a foundation of the cosmic distance scale, and the hope is that these new functional models can provide more accurate brightness estimates and therefore ease limits on how accurately important cosmological parameters can be measured. Other problems well suited to FDA methods include the detection of dim intermittent signals, and the classification of sources from features in their light curves.<br/><br/>The team includes experts in astronomy and in statistics, and will pursue innovative research in both disciplines. This research will enhance their partnership by direct collaboration, by dissemination of results in both communities, and by training a graduate student in information sciences to work on problems in astronomy. The methods produced will improve the science return on the large investments being made in astronomical surveys.

In some cases, called ?symbiotic binaries,? the red giant can transfer matter onto the white dwarf. Such systems provide clues about the way the evolution of one star affects the other. They also provide clues about the types of stars that can explode as supernovae, completely disrupting the entire star. This project will use a robotic telescope called ?SkyMapper? in Australia to search the southern skies for large numbers of symbiotic binaries that previous surveys may have missed. It will also involve large numbers of amateur astronomers around the world who are members of the American Association of Variable Star Observers. Their observations will help professional astronomers to determine the true numbers of these systems in the Milky Way Galaxy.<br/><br/>2. Symbiotic stars are binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a red-giant companion. Understanding these systems may have far-reaching implications for binary stellar evolution and may help to constrain the fraction of SNIa that originate as symbiotics. Arguing that an important, and possibly dominant, sub-population of such systems may have been missed in previous surveys, the Principal Investigator will mine the data provided by the SkyMapper Southern Sky Survey based at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia to determine the true population of symbiotic binaries in the Galaxy. The Intellectual Merit of the proposed research stems from the potential for discovering large numbers of previously unknown symbiotics, from determining the true population of such systems in the Galaxy, and from the potential impact of these discoveries on our understanding of binary evolution and the origins of Type Ia supernovae.

In order to determine the rotation periods and sizes of asteroids, scientists measure the changes in light from an asteroid over time, known as making lightcurve observations.

This proposal will allow the continuing maintenance of the asteroid lightcurve database (LCDB). The LCDB has become a widely-used and heavily relied-upon tool for those involved in asteroid research. The data from the LCDB will be used for a wide range of research programs such as determining rotation rates among objects of specific size, orbital group, or taxonomic class; the evolution of asteroid rates due to non-gravitational, e.g., thermal, forces; and the population of binary asteroids among different groups.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies and how these SMBHs are linked to their host galaxies. Quasar winds are fundamentally linked to mass accretion onto rapidly growing SMBHs, and they also likely serve as agents of SMBH feedback into typical massive galaxies. This project will advance understanding of several key aspects of quasar winds using an unprecedentedly large---and still growing---spectroscopic survey of multi-year ultraviolet broad absorption line (BAL) variability in about 2100 BAL quasars. This survey is primarily based on spectra from the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and is about two orders of magnitude larger than past comparable surveys; supporting targeted spectroscopy is also obtained via Penn State's access to the queue-scheduled Hobby-Eberly Telescope.<br/><br/>The PI's annual summer workshops will serve as a high-leverage way of helping about 50 Pennsylvania high school teachers educate their thousands of students better about space, time, gravity, black holes, and the scientific method. Teachers from underserved rural and urban school districts, including underrepresented minorities and women, will be specifically recruited with scholarship funds. The workshops' programs will include an overview of the project's scientific discoveries and an associated activity, and the postdoctoral research associate will help with workshop planning and presentation. The postdoctoral researcher will also work as a central member of PI's group, thereby developing his or her research, teaching, and outreach skills. He or she will lead much of the analysis as well as many of the high-impact journal articles and presentations. The postdoctoral researcher will also be a primary mentor of the undergraduate researcher, who will develop hands-on research skills via well-defined projects.<br/><br/>More technically, this project will use its database to provide the following specific advances: (1) unmatched large-scale measurements/limits of BAL acceleration and deceleration that constrain BAL-wind feedback into galaxies; (2) measurements of BAL vs. emission-line properties that test the drivers of BAL variability and quasar-wind models; (3) determination of the in-depth relations between BAL disappearance and emergence with associated improvements in direct BAL-lifetime estimates; (4) an understanding of the nature of unusually stable BALs and their possible relation to ongoing large-scale galactic feedback; and (5) determination of whether remarkable redshifted BAL troughs arise from rotationally dominated outflows or high-velocity infalling material. These results will play an important role in transforming the field of multi-year BAL variability studies into one that supplies rigorous, large-sample constraints that can effectively guide models of quasar winds and their feedback. They are expected to be the best such results available for at least a decade.","lime"

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to develop detailed theories of star formation. As star formation occurs in giant molecular clouds (GMCs) within galaxies, astrophysicists study the formation and evolution of GMCs. With unprecedented high quality and high resolution data, this study will explore the evolution of GMCs and consequent star formation in galactic disks, and it will critically and quantitatively reconsider the standard picture of gas evolution in galaxies, specifically the one driven by stellar feedback. The study enables for the first time a census of GMC populations in substantial spiral galaxies.<br/><br/>This project will also serve as a prototype for research with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) (a new international facility funded in part by the National Science Foundation), which will resolve the internal structure of GMCs in nearby galaxies and routinely produce images of molecular gas and star formation in very distant galaxies. For this project the investigators will use observations from their new CO survey of nearby galaxies with the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45m telescope (NRO45), a survey that is nearly complete. The investigators will release to the astronomical community the CO data of nearby galaxies from CARMA and NRO45, and they will also release the software for the combination of interferometer and single-dish data developed for the survey.<br/><br/>The investigating team also plans educational and outreach activities that involve building a radio interferometer for a hands-on astronomical laboratory course and disseminating the course materials to other schools.

The fellow's project involves exoplanets. Today, astronomers are discovering a rich panoply of exoplanets in our Galaxy. Many of these exoplanets are in multi-planet systems. Some show surprisingly different characteristics from our own Solar System that pose serious problems for standard isolated planet formation theories. Strong evidence indicates that the majority of stars form in clusters, many of which dissolve within the age of the Universe. Therefore, many of the exoplanets observed today---in stars clusters and the field of the Galaxy---may have been born inside star clusters and subjected to past perturbations from nearby stars. Understanding how stellar encounters within this birth environment affect the dynamical evolution of planetary systems is paramount to interpreting the characteristics of all the newly discovered exoplanets and how these relate to the planet formation epoch. <br/><br/>To address these important questions, the fellow work with a team of experts to complete development of the first computer code to self-consistently simulate the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems in realistic star clusters. Dr. Geller and collaborators have already completed a pilot code demonstrating the feasibility of the most critical and innovative components, and the full code will be completed early in the first year of the fellowship. The fellow will then use this code to model nine open star clusters, including four in the Kepler field that have been surveyed comprehensively for transiting exoplanets. Each cluster will be modeled with multiple different initial planet populations to cover the range in characteristics of observed exoplanets. The simulations will be analyzed, accounting for the unique sensitivity limits of each transit survey, and the results will be compared directly with the observations. This project will reveal---for the first time self-consistently---how stellar encounters within star clusters of a wide range in age, density, mass, etc., influence the dynamical evolution of multi-planet systems including those like our Solar System and how the characteristics of exoplanets observed today in both clusters and the field may have been modified in the past by their birth environment.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component. The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach in partnership with the Northwestern's NSF-funded GK-12 and CE21 programs to develop, test, and disseminate about 15 high school lesson plans based on the scientific research of this project. The fellow will work directly with a Northwestern graduate student to develop around five classroom-tested high school lesson plans each year. To supplement the lesson plans, the fellow will also develop a web-based student-friendly interface to both analyze the products of the proposed simulations and to allow students to run simulations of their own. During years 2 and 3 the fellow will integrate these lesson plans into teacher professional development workshops, which the PI will co-lead. Through these workshops, the fellow will train about 20 Chicago Public School and area teachers to use his lesson plans, thereby reaching about 2000 students with his curricular materials by the end of the fellowship. Both the GK-12 and CE21 programs are well established at Northwestern University and have been running successfully for years. This is a natural and mutually beneficial partnership that will help train the fellow for a future career teaching computational thinking methods in undergraduate physics and astronomy courses.","lime"

Any clusters that are confirmed at very great distances add significantly to the few that are known. This project employs a unique method for identifying new, distant clusters of galaxies, and this sample of distant galaxy clusters will help in determining the epoch of galaxy formation, in studying the galaxy populations of clusters over time, and in constraining cosmological models including dark energy. <br/><br/>Clusters usually contain bright elliptical galaxies near their centers, and these galaxies host supermassive black holes in their cores. Accreting supermassive black holes produce jets and lobes detected in the radio, and these jets and lobes become distorted as they interact with the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). These distortions sometimes result in the lobes being bent in the same direction, resulting in a wide-angle tail (WAT) morphology. Significant groundwork has been laid in studying the cluster environments of WATs at low-to-moderate redshifts. In addition, a large sample of 653 WATs with cluster environments too faint (and therefore distant) to be studied with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey has been assembled. All of these objects are being observed in the infrared with Spitzer. Based on cluster association rates at lower redshift z, this project's sample is expected to reveal approximately 400 new clusters at z > 0.7. Follow-up deep optical imaging is the next step in the survey and will be achieved using the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope (DCT). By the nature of their selection, all the clusters will contain radio-loud active galaxies, allowing the study of active-galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback at high redshift. Poor, low-mass clusters at high redshifts are particularly important for studying AGN feedback and for constraining models of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich power spectrum. High-redshift, low-mass clusters are also the most difficult ones to find using other cluster survey techniques, making this survey particularly useful because it will locate distant clusters with a wide range of masses.<br/><br/>Research results of this project will be included in undergraduate classes. Students at both the undergraduate and graduate levels will be involved with all aspects of the project. The Principal Investigator (PI) will mentor undergraduate and graduate students, who will accompany the PI on observing trips to the telescope. The PI will engage the community through public elementary school visits and collaboration on science museum exhibits. Students and the PI will participate with public outreach efforts with the Discovery Channel, including films and online science reporting.","lime"

Graur will study two types of transients: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), which are supernovae occurring in two stars orbiting one another; and Tidal Disruption Events (TDE), which are bright flares produced when a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy disrupts the material from a nearby star. Few SNe Ia and TDEs have been observed to date, however, and Graur's work has the potential to drastically increase the detections of SNe Ia and TDEs, allowing astronomers to study these transients in a statistical manner. Graur will also build a mentoring program in which postdoctoral scholars and graduate students will supervise high school students in advanced scientific research projects. <br/><br/>Graur will enhance his supernova detection code to enable detection of all types of transients in large scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys, starting with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and will integrate the enhanced code into the upcoming Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument survey.

Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy. Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries and depend on interpreting observations. This project focuses on how dust in galaxies affects observations. Dust profoundly affects essentially all of the observable diagnostics of galaxies, such as their brightnesses and colors, structures (disks, bulges), color gradients and stellar mass estimates. Previous work demonstrated that more luminous disk galaxies tend to suffer more dust attenuation than low-luminosity galaxies and that their central parts suffer more dust absorption than their outer parts. Yet, two critical questions remain unanswered: (1) How does global dust attenuation---and attenuation gradients---depend simultaneously on the entire set of relevant parameters (luminosity or stellar mass, star formation rate, density or scale length, and structure)? (2) How in detail are commonly-used measures of galaxy structure affected by dust attenuation as a function of galaxy parameters? This project will study these questions by assembling samples of intrinsically similar galaxies (stellar mass, star formation rate, density, structure).<br/><br/>In addition, the principle investigator will lead a collaborative effort to widen the use and assess the impact of effective student-centered pedagogy in University of Michigan introductory undergraduate astronomy classes (e.g., inquiry-based activities, lecture tutorials, think-pair share, diagnostic assessments and learning analytics). This project also involves training of a graduate student, including mentorship and teaching skills; the development of undergraduate research skills in the context of this research project; and involvement in outreach, including in a local elementary school.<br/><br/>More technically, because the samples of similar galaxies are viewed from random angles and edge-on galaxies are much more strongly affected by dust attenuation, studying how the optical properties vary with inclination enables a model-independent measurement of relative dust attenuation as a function of galaxy parameters. However, this crucially depends on the ability to assemble samples of truly similar galaxies, and many previous works use at least some selection criteria that are biased by dust attenuation. This results in samples where the high and low inclination members are not truly similar, and this inclination-dependent cross-sample contamination significantly affects conclusions about the dependence of dust attenuation on galaxy parameters. A critical advance of the investigators' work is that they are developing a set of selection criteria that enables the assembly of samples of similar galaxies in a manner that is unaffected by inclination bias. This advance enables the comparison of the observed properties of samples of truly similar galaxies with unprecedented accuracy. Therefore, the goals of this project are two-fold: (1) To use wide-area near-infrared surveys and this novel inclination-independent measures of galaxy structure to select samples of truly intrinsically similar galaxies in a way that is independent of inclination to a degree never before achieved. (2) To use these samples to measure the dependence of dust attenuation on all relevant galaxy parameters in a complete, unbiased, robust and detailed manner to measure for the first time the effects of dust attenuation on SDSS-based measures of galaxy structure and to measure for the first time the radial gradients in dust attenuation as a function of galaxy properties. The investigators will release their catalogues of structural metrics and other measurements to the public.","lime"

This Penn State and Villanova collaboration involves undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers in all facets of the research, and members of both teams actively participate in public outreach events.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this program is to measure the mass and radius of binary stars with precision better than 3%, while also characterizing the stars' compositions. This measurement precision is necessary to address well recognized discrepancies for low-mass stars of 5-15% between predictions of current models and the handful of existing measurements. These measurements are achieved through the combination of ultra-precise photometry from NASA's Kepler observatory and extensive high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy from near-infrared and visible wavelength spectrographs (APOGEE, HYDRA, HRS) that have been collected by the team. Data are analyzed with cutting-edge algorithms for light-curve modelling (PHOEBE), multi-dimensional radial velocity measurements (TODCOR/TRICOR), and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for assessing robust and repeatable parameters and parameter uncertainties. Results from this program will more than double the number of low-mass stars with both precision mass and radius measurements, and with spectroscopically determined compositions.","lime"

Recent discoveries of the enormous variety of planetary systems around stars beyond the Sun have only increased our curiosity about our own planetary system and why it appears the way it does. One of the key tools to study the entire history of our Solar System is its Asteroid Belt, since that traces the migration of the giant planets, as well as epochs of major change and collisions, and it contains samples from nearly the entire suite of Solar System material from its very beginning. This project will attempt to better identify families of asteroids that record the history of catastrophic asteroid collisions. <br/><br/>The project team will capitalize on the experience of one of the Co-PIs with developing visualizations by developing a visualization product specifically with planetariums in mind. The visualization product they intend to produce will be called ""When Asteroids Collide"" and will engagingly visualize the structure and compositional make-up of the Asteroid Belt and its evolution in time. It will highlight the creation and evolution of families across the asteroid belt and throughout time and help explain complicated asteroid dynamics. The visualization will be circulated through the network of planetariums that have already reached out to Co-PI, as well as through the online and film festival avenues that he has used successfully to share his work with very broad audiences.<br/><br/>The census of known asteroid families is clearly incomplete as a function of time, across all types of asteroids, and across all regions of the Asteroid Belt. This project would calibrate the project team's current techniques to understand their detection biases, and to develop new techniques to better extract and characterize these families in current and future datasets. It will be accomplished by building a calibration testbed using synthetic families implanted in current asteroid datasets to calibrate asteroid family detection tools, building new family detection tools utilizing the orbital elements and the known size-dependent Yarkovsky spreading of as a function of size, calibrating old and new tools and using them to create a de-biased census of the asteroid belt families as a function of their age, size and physical properties.","lime"

This project focuses on deep maps of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization that offer tremendous opportunities for cosmology and fundamental physics. Most cosmologists believe that the entire observable Universe was spawned in a fraction of a second by the superluminal ""inflation"" of a subnuclear volume. Inflation produced a cosmic gravitational background (CGB) that may be detectable now via the faint signature imprinted in ""B-mode"" patterns of degree-scale CMB polarization. Their amplitude directly measures the energy scale of the inflationary Big Bang. Detecting the polarization signature of the CGB may be the most important goal in cosmology today. At arcminute scales CMB polarization traces gravitational lensing from the high redshift Universe, measuring early dark energy and neutrino mass. Where they overlap, such measurements will allow delensing of inflationary CGB searches, enabling better constraints of inflationary physics.<br/><br/>The BICEP/SPUD series of experiments operating from the South Pole have pursued a targeted strategy toward this important science goal. BICEP1 produced the best current published upper limit on inflation from B-modes. Dr. Kovac is now principal investigator (PI) of the collaboration that fielded, operates, and analyzes data from BICEP2 and SPUD. The combined BICEP2/SPUD system concentrates its sensitivity on a small foreground-clean region to optimize the search for the CGB. As other CMB polarization surveys come online in the near future, demand will grow for joint analysis of overlapping maps. Given the major implications of a B-mode detection, any claim will need to be confirmed by rigorous map-level comparisons among independent experiments. Separation of polarized Galactic emission and removal of contributions of gravitational lensing to the B-mode signature also require the joint use of surveys. The study of dark energy and neutrinos and other science goals motivate correlation of CMB maps with optical and radio cosmological surveys.<br/><br/>This project seeks to share ultra-deep CMB polarization maps from SPUD, BICEP2, BICEP1, and DASI. It develops and disseminates complete data products and software tools that broaden the use and impact of those pathfinding surveys while setting what are expected to be useful standards for others to do the same. This project aims to derive the needed portable data products and software tools, to test them in key joint analyses of overlapping maps with external collaborators including SPT, to share them with the full astrophysics community, and to encourage independent reanalysis. Such reanalysis by the astrophysics community, strongly motivated by the science goals above, may also yield unanticipated discoveries.<br/><br/>This project integrates education with research by directly broadening the audience for CMB science. The PI will develop and share a portable curriculum based on a highly successful CMB discovery laboratory aimed at undergraduate students, which will be used across many undergraduate teaching institutions. The PI will also publish virtual tours of the early Universe and interactive deep CMB maps, which may directly image primordial gravitational waves, through the WorldWide Telescope, a web-based astronomy visualization tool used for public and secondary-school educational outreach. This project provides training for a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow who will work closely with the PI on these and other elements of the education and research plan.","lime"

The balance of this exchange with time is thought to explain a number of key galaxy properties. The proposing team will test modern models of galaxy assembly by studying the relationship between galaxies and their circumgalactic gas using a combination of space- and ground-based gas-phase spectroscopy, ground-based optical imaging and spectroscopy of galaxies, and numerical simulations of galaxies in a cosmological context. Specifically, they will: (1) measure the metallicity distribution in circumgalactic gas using high-resolution spectral observations of quasar absorption lines; (2) determine the covering factor of cold gas as a function of distance from the absorbing galaxies; (3) compare the physical and statistical properties of the circumgalactic gas with those of the central galaxies; and (4) develop new simulations and diagnostics to compare model predictions with observations. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the project, and parts of the observational work will be incorporated in an undergraduate course. The team will contribute to the development of a planetarium show, and will disseminate observational data and simulation results through a website.","lime"

Astrophysicists can virtually look back in time by examining some of the most distant galaxies in the Universe, whose light has taken billions of years to reach Earth. Detailed, careful study of these very distant galaxies is critical to understanding how the first stars and galaxies formed. Unfortunately, it is very challenging to identify these galaxies. This project aims to use a new technique that exploits gravitational lensing by foreground clusters of galaxies that magnify these distant galaxies, making them easier to detect.<br/><br/>The principal investigators' (PIs') new theoretical framework for analyzing multiple-lensing planes reveals that there are mass distributions consisting of multiple structures along the line-of-sight and large integrated masses that produce a many-fold increase in the number of lensed z > ~7 sources, particularly at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function. These beams are effective because they create significant magnification over a large area, or high etendue. Cosmological simulations suggest that they are rare but identifiable by choosing lines-of-sight with the highest integrated luminosities of galaxies that trace the densest structures, i.e., luminous red galaxies. The PIs have now identified 40 such lines-of-sight in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Spectroscopy of the first seven confirms that they are likely the most powerful gravitational lens telescopes in the sky. This project will use a comprehensive observational and theoretical program to enable highly efficient ground- and space-based follow-up surveys for lensed z ~ 7 to 10 sources. Using galaxy spectroscopy and lensed arc imaging to constrain each line-of-sight mass distribution, coupled with theoretical modeling to generate a precise lensing magnification map, the PIs will place the first limits on the faint end luminosity evolution of the most distant galaxies.<br/><br/>This work will advance the training of graduate students at The University of Arizona and Rutgers University by allowing them to work with senior personnel on forefront observational analyses and theoretical modeling. Co-PI Zabludoff is involved in The University of Arizona's Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) chapter, where she discusses her research in their workshops for teenage girls. She will also talk about astronomy research and careers with members of the Tohono O'odham Nation and with students in local schools. Co-PI Keeton is the Faculty Director of the Aresty Research Center for Undergraduates at Rutgers, a privately-endowed center that supports approximately 200 student research projects each year. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education via the co-PI's partnership, advance the teaching of faculty and the training and learning of students, broaden the dissemination of knowledge through the public release of the lens modeling software, and may increase the participation of underrepresented women and Native Americans through outreach.","lime"
