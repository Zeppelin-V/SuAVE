ISSN: 2213-624X,0.646,0.385,,,Case Studies on Transport Policy,,"Transport policy is a multidisciplinary field where engineering, economics, sociology and law must come together in well-articulated and effective solutions. Despite being a field of effective intervention, most scientific publications address transport policy with a theoretical and often abstract approach, making its understanding difficult for non-senior academics and even more opaque for practitioners. While the merits of case study methods both for undergraduate and graduate teaching are recognised, academics struggle to find empirical material that provides objective and operational illustration of the theories and approaches lectured. This is a major barrier not only in the teaching context but also for practitioners.   Case Studies on Transport Policy covers this gap by providing a repository of relevant material to support teaching and transferability of experiences.

The impressive development of molecular megatechnologies and of bioinformatics have greatly increased our knowledge of the evolution, transmission and pathogenicity of infectious diseases. Research has shown that host susceptibility to many infectious diseases has a genetic basis. Furthermore, much is now known on the molecular epidemiology, evolution and virulence of pathogenic agents, as well as their resistance to drugs, vaccines, and antibiotics. Equally, research on the genetics of disease vectors has greatly improved our understanding of their systematics, has increased our capacity to identify target populations for control or intervention, and has provided detailed information on the mechanisms of insecticide resistance.

It has reached a level of predictive capability that now firmly complements the traditional pillars of experimentation and theory.

The resulting data explosion allows for detailed data driven modeling and simulation.

Contributions from neurology, communication disorders, linguistics, neuropsychology and cognitive science in general are welcome. Published articles will typically address issues relating some aspect of language or speech function to its neurological substrates with clear theoretical import. Interdisciplinary work on any aspect of the biological foundations of language and its disorders resulting from brain damage is encouraged. Studies of normal subjects, with clear reference to brain functions, are appropriate. Group-studies...

Mutations are defined as all possible alterations in DNA sequence and sequence organization, from point mutations to genome structural variation, chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. Epimutations are defined as alterations in the epigenome, i.e., changes in DNA methylation, histone modification and small regulatory RNAs. We are interested in: mechanisms of (epi)mutation induction, for example, during DNA repair, replication or recombination; novel methods of (epi)mutation detection, with a focus on ultra-high-throughput sequencing; the landscape of somatic mutations and epimutations in cancer and aging; the role of de novo mutations in human disease and aging; mutations in population genomics; interactions between mutations and epimutations; the...

ISSN: 2213-5979,1.83,2.073,,,Photoacoustics,,"Impact Per Publication (IPP*) 2015: 4.0   The aim of the  Photoacoustics  journal ( PACS ) is to publish original research and review contributions within the fast growing field of photoacoustics ( optoacoustics ) and thermoacoustics , which exploits optically and electromagnetically excited acoustical and thermal phenomena for visualization and characterization of a variety of materials and biological tissues, including living organisms. While some of the spectroscopic and photothermal applications have reached a mature state, many other research directions experience an explosive growth, in particular biomedical photoacoustics , which is currently considered the fastest growing bio-imaging modality. The wealth of investigated topics clearly indicates that this field has developed a broad range of tools for fundamental and applied research. The enormous recent progress is greatly supported by the advances in laser technologies, ultrasound detection approaches, development of inverse theory and fast...

Deteriorative reactions occur during processing, when polymers are subjected to heat, oxygen and mechanical stress, and during the useful life of the materials when oxygen and sunlight are the most important degradative agencies. In more specialised applications, degradation may be induced by high energy radiation, ozone, atmospheric pollutants, mechanical stress, biological action, hydrolysis and many other influences. The mechanisms of these reactions and stabilisation processes must be understood if the technology and application of polymers are to continue to advance. The reporting of investigations of this kind is therefore a major function of this journal.
