The workshop will have participation from SI2 EAGER and RAPID awardees and selected awardees of the ACI VOSS program that examines cyberinfrastructures from the social and organizational perspective. In addition, the proximity to NSF will encourage participation by Program Officers from across the Foundation. Goals of this workshop include: (a) providing a focused forum for PIs to share technical information with each other and with NSF Program Officers, (b) encouraging exploration of emerging topics, (c) identifying emerging best practices across the supported software projects, (d) stimulating thinking on new ways of achieving software sustainability, and (d) disseminating the shared experiences of the researchers via an online web portal.<br/><br/>The workshop is expected to host close to 150 SI2 and other awardees, other speakers and panelists. The workshop will use a hybrid style, blending a traditional, top-down driven agenda with a interactive, adaptive, participant-driven agenda. <br/><br/>The proposed workshop will support the exchange of ideas among the current software cyberinfrastructure development projects. It will provide guidance on issues related to the development of robust software and to the problem of software sustainability. Involvement of program officers across NSF is expected to help the interdisciplinary SI2 awardees understand the relevance and impact of cyberinfrastructure throughout the NSF. The participation of these researchers and program officers in a common forum will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SI2 projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to the most science and engineering domains possible. The hybrid approach is innovative and holds the promise of creating rich interactions among PIs, resulting in richer collaboration and learning. The results of this workshop thus have the potential to guide cyberinfrastructure development and cyberinfrastructure driven research for both the participating projects and for the wider software development community.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1606994","fuchsia_atom","2016 Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) Principal Investigators Workshop"

In 2011 and 2012 the OCI Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) program funded software efforts in small development efforts that can provide software pieces that can be integrated into the larger cyberinfrastructure, and larger collaborations that were delivering significant community software. In addition, new SI2 awards aimed at conceptualizing large-scale software institutes, aimed at providing a fabric for the software needed by domain scientists to achieve breakthroughs in their intra and inter-disciplinary efforts, will be awarded. New NSF initiatives such as EarthCube are defining roadmaps for cyberinfrastructure development in Earth sciences. This workshop will bring together the Principle Investigators of the recent SI2 awards to discuss potential synergies and collaborations, define challenges ahead, discuss the relationship of the SI2 efforts to the planned Software Institutes, and explore the relationship of the OCI-funded software in the context of the broad NSF initiatives such as EarthCube, DataWay, and other planned community-focused efforts.<br/><br/>To achieve its goals, the workshop will focus on these main themes: (i) Discussing SI2 projects within the context of SI2 Institutes and NSF-wide initiative such as EarthCube, DataWay, and others; (ii) sharing experiences in building quality software and services; (iii) fostering collaboration and providing incentives for collaboration and cyberinfrastructure development as a career; and (iv) sustaining the software capabilities in the long term, defining software value.<br/><br/>The workshop will solicit participation from major science and engineering projects that rely on the national cyberinfrastructure for their computations and data management needs. Their participation will help ensure that the cyberinfrastructure software developed as part of SI2 projects will be relevant and broadly applicable to a number of science and engineering domains. The results of this workshop will then potentially guide cyberinfrastructure development and testing in the future.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1256100","fuchsia_atom","The Role of Software and Software Institutes in Computational Science Over Time"

Similarly, most of the data analysis is conducted with tools developed in isolation and targeted to a specific simulation platform or research domain; very little systematic and direct technology transfer between astrophysical researchers exists. The yt project is a parallel analysis and visualization toolkit designed to support a collaborative community of researchers as they focus on answering physical questions, rather than the technical mechanics of reading, processing and visualizing data formats. This project will enable the development of advanced, physics-based modules that apply universally across simulation codes, advancing scientific inquiry and enabling more efficient utilization of computational and human resources. In doing so, it will help advance a myriad of research goals from the study of black hole binaries to the growth of cosmic structure. In addition, the project will serve as a touchstone for collaboration and cross-code utilization between many groups studying diverse phenomena. Moreover, the project will be developed through a community-oriented process, engaging a wide range of participants.<br/><br/>The infrastructure development in this research will enable these capabilities by broadening the applicable simulation platforms within yt, enabling cross-code utilization of microphysical solvers and physics modules and in situ analysis, and developing collaborative platforms for the exploration of astrophysical datasets. In particular, it will develop the capabilities of yt in three primary mechanisms. The first is to enable support for additional, fundamentally different simulation platforms such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, unstructured mesh, and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. The second is to provide simulation instrumentation components to ease the process of developing simulation codes, interfacing and exchanging technology between those simulation codes, and to enable deeper, on-the-fly integration of astrophysical simulation codes with yt and other analysis toolkits. The final focus is on developing interface components to enable collaborative and interactive exploration of data utilizing web-based platforms. An explicit goal of this SI2-SSE project is the development of collaborative relationships between scientists, furthering the development of the field as a whole. By conducting all business in the open with a focus on developing and encouraging collaborative, welcoming environments for contributors and researchers, this SSE will help to foster a level playing field that is more accessible to all parties, particularly women and underrepresented minorities. An explicit milestone of this project is to streamline the process of conducting direct outreach through scientific visualization, greatly expanding the domains and individuals engaged in STEM-based public outreach.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339624","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: yt: Reusable Components for Simulating, Analyzing and Visualizing Astrophysical Systems"

Moreover, the project will be developed through a community-oriented process, engaging a wide range of participants.<br/><br/>The infrastructure development in this research will enable these capabilities by broadening the applicable simulation platforms within yt, enabling cross-code utilization of microphysical solvers and physics modules and in situ analysis, and developing collaborative platforms for the exploration of astrophysical datasets. In particular, it will develop the capabilities of yt in three primary mechanisms. The first is to enable support for additional, fundamentally different simulation platforms such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics, unstructured mesh, and non-Cartesian coordinate systems. The second is to provide simulation instrumentation components to ease the process of developing simulation codes, interfacing and exchanging technology between those simulation codes, and to enable deeper, on-the-fly integration of astrophysical simulation codes with yt and other analysis toolkits. The final focus is on developing interface components to enable collaborative and interactive exploration of data utilizing web-based platforms. An explicit goal of this SI2-SSE project is the development of collaborative relationships between scientists, furthering the development of the field as a whole. By conducting all business in the open with a focus on developing and encouraging collaborative, welcoming environments for contributors and researchers, this SSE will help to foster a level playing field that is more accessible to all parties, particularly women and underrepresented minorities. An explicit milestone of this project is to streamline the process of conducting direct outreach through scientific visualization, greatly expanding the domains and individuals engaged in STEM-based public outreach.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1535651","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: yt: Reusable Components for Simulating, Analyzing and Visualizing Astrophysical Systems"

Among the many uses of computational chemistry codes are to aid in the design of new materials with specific properties, to understand protein folding dynamics related to the human body, to understand the mechanisms of enzyme catalysis to produce biofuels, and to identify and characterize gaseous species in the atmosphere. Because computational chemistry simulations can require large amounts of computer, memory and disk space, one focus of this research is to reduce the demands on computer resources by exploiting methods that can efficiently fragment large molecules into smaller pieces and at the same time take advantage of computers that have many thousands of computer cores. The principal investigators are developers of several computational chemistry programs, each of which has unique functionalities that have taken multiple person-years to develop and implement. In order to minimize further development efforts and to maximize the utility of the unique features, a second key focus of this research will be to develop the ability of each program to access the unique features and data of the other programs. A major bottleneck in the effort to construct high performance computers with more and more compute cores is the power that is required to drive such systems. One way that the research team will address the power issue is to explore the utility of low power architectures, such as graphical processing units for computational chemistry calculations. All of the newly developed codes will be made available to the user community by web download at no cost. This project is supported by programs in the Division of Chemistry in MPS and the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in CISE. <br/><br/>This project presents an integrated computational science approach to very high quality electronic structure and dynamics calculations that will (a) be broadly accessible to both the development and applications communities, (b) have the capability to address problems of great interest, such as the properties of liquids and solvent effects, and photochemical/photobiological dynamics with high accuracy, (c) provide interoperability and sustainability into the foreseeable future, and (d) solve bottlenecks including power consumption using accelerators. A primary goal is to provide to the broad community new, accurate approaches that may be easily used, with a clear path forward to further code improvement and development. As part of the proposed effort, in addition to the usual outlets of journal articles and public presentations, the investigators will organize workshops at prominent national meetings, so that the expertise and software developed will be available to as broad a group of users as possible. All of the developed codes will be available on the web for easy downloads. The proposed research will develop new paradigms for interoperability, with a focus on the highly popular program suites GAMESS, NWChem, PSI4 and the AIMS dynamics code. Also included will be a cloud-based client-server model, a common quantum chemistry driver and novel data management approaches. The integration of the codes will be accomplished by making use of the combined expertise of the PIs in developing interoperable methods and data interfaces in computational science. In addition, several new methods will be developed, including novel explicit (R12) correlation methods that will be integrated with the most accurate levels of theory: multi-reference and the most accurate and novel coupled cluster methods, as well as the derivation and implementation of analytic derivatives.

The goal of this project is to address a compelling need in geodynamics, in which continuum mechanics is applied to the study of geophysical processes, such as convection in the Earth?s mantle. A primary tool of geodynamics research is computational models of the flow of the extremely viscous interior of the Earth over hundreds of millions to billions of years. A long-standing challenge for these models is the need to accurately model sharp interfaces in temperature, viscosity, and other properties. These arise when, for example, modeling subduction (in which a cold tectonic plate plunges into the hot interior) or rising plumes (in which a hot boundary layer instability rises through the mantle and encounters the cold boundary layer of the tectonic plates). The project will foster interdisciplinary communication and the application of state-of-the-art applied and computational mathematics to fundamental problems in geophysics. It involves early-career mathematical scientists in the application of state-of-the-art numerical algorithms to geodynamics and, in particular, will provide an opportunity to increase the participation of women in mathematics and geodynamics research.<br/><br/>This project involves the design and implementation of state-of-the-art SSEs for computing the evolution of significant processes in the Earth's mantle in which an essential feature of the problem is the presence of one or more moving boundaries, interfaces, or steep gradients in temperature, composition, or viscosity. The SSEs will address two critical issues that currently limit modern mantle convection simulations. All computational models of mantle convection currently in use produce significant overshoot and undershoot in the neighborhood of sharp gradients in temperature and viscosity. The cause of these overshoots and undershoots is a numerical artifact, which is well-known and well-understood in other fields, such as the computational shock physics community. Over the past thirty years researchers in computational shock physics have developed a variety of high-order accurate, monotone numerical methods, which preserve the physically correct maximum and minimum values of the computed quantities, while producing a high-order accurate numerical approximation of these quantities. Another compelling need in computational geodynamics is the ability to track discontinuous jumps in quantities such as material composition. Here high-order accurate interface tracking algorithms are required, since these fields undergo large-scale deformation, yet quantities such as the viscosity must be accurately approximated at the interface between two materials.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1440811","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Development and Implementation of Software Elements using State-of-the-Art Computational Methodology to Advance Modeling Heterogeneities and Mixing in Earth's Mantle"

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create significant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC?s Stampede system, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a significant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This confluence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this work. <br/><br/>To address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi&#64257;cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. <br/><br/>This work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualization capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that efficiently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs. In addition, the project team will disseminate this work to the general public through NSF XD program, the VisIt visualization toolkit and by exhibiting at forums such as IEEE Visualization, IEEE High Performance Graphics and ACM Supercomputing.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339840","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: A Comprehensive Ray Tracing Framework for Visualization in Distributed-Memory Parallel Environments"

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450180","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

""Volunteer computing"" uses these consumer devices, volunteered by their owners, to do scientific computing. In addition to providing additional, much-needed computational resources to scientists, volunteer computing publicizes scientific research and engages citizens in science. BOINC is the primary software system for volunteer computing. It was developed at UC Berkeley with NSF support starting in 2002. Until now, BOINC has been based on a model of independent competing projects. Scientists set up their own BOINC servers, port their applications to run on BOINC, and publicize their projects to attract volunteers. There are about 40 such projects, in many areas of science: examples include Einstein@home, CERN, and SETI@home (astrophysics), Rosetta@home and GPUGrid.net (biomedicine), Climateprediction.net (climate study), and IBM World Community Grid (multiple applications). Together these projects have about 400,000 active volunteers and 12 PetaFLOPS of computing throughput. This model, while successful to an extent, has reached a limit. The number of projects and volunteers has stagnated. Volunteer computing is supplying lots of computing power, but only to a few research projects. For other scientists, there are two major barriers. First, creating a BOINC project has significant overhead: learning a new technology, creating a public web site, generating publicity, and so on. Second, volunteer computing is risky and uncertain; there is no guarantee that a new project will attract volunteers. This project aims to break this barrier, and to make volunteer computing available to all scientists doing high-throughput computing, by replacing the competing-projects model with a new ""central broker"" model. The new model has two related parts: 1) the integration of BOINC with existing high-throughput computing facilities such as supercomputing centers and science portals. Jobs currently run on cluster nodes will be transparently offloaded to volunteer computers. Scientists using these facilities will see faster turnaround times; they'll benefit from volunteer computing without even knowing it's there. 2) The project will change the volunteer interface so that participants sign up for scientific areas and goals rather then for particular projects. For example, a participant might sign up to contribute to cancer research. A central broker, to be developed as part of this project, would dynamically assign their computing resources to projects doing that type of research. This project mobilizes public support for and interest in scientific research by encouraging ""volunteer computing"" and engaging citizens in the conduct of the research itself. It simultaneously advances NSF's mission to advance science while broadening citizen engagement.<br/><br/>The first year of this project will prototype each of these parts, and will integrate BOINC with TACC and nanoHub. Integrating BOINC with existing HTC systems involves several subtasks: 1) Job routing: modifying existing job processing systems used by TACC and nanoHub (Launcher and Rappture respectively) to decide when a group of jobs should be offloaded to BOINC. This decision might involve the estimated runtime of the jobs, input and output file sizes, data sensitivity, the deadline or priority of the jobs, and the identity of the job submitter. 2) Job format conversion: mapping job descriptions (input/output file specifications, resource and timing requirements) to their BOINC equivalents. 3) Application packaging: adapting existing applications (such as nanoHub's simulation tools and TACC's Autodock) to run under BOINC. We will use BOINC's virtual machine facility, which packages an application as a virtual machine image (VirtualBox or Docker) and a program to be run within the VM. This allows existing Linux applications to run on consumer desktop platforms such as Windows and Mac, as well as providing a strong security sandbox and an efficient application-independent checkpoint/restart mechanism. 4) File handling: moving input and output files between existing storage systems (typically inaccessible from outside firewalls) to Internet-visible servers. This will use existing BOINC components that manage files based on hashes to eliminate duplicate transfer and storage of files. 5) Job monitoring and control: adapting existing web- or command-line based tools for monitoring the progress of batches of jobs, and for aborting jobs, to work with BOINC. This will use existing Web RPCs provided by BOINC for these purposes. This project will carry out these tasks by designing and implementing new software as needed, testing for correctness, performance, and scalability, and deploying it in a production environment. The second part of the project - a brokering system for allocating computing power based on volunteer scientific preferences - will be designed and prototyped.

Any distributed collaboration and resource federation system requires methods for authentication and authorization, data movement, and remote computation. Of the many solutions that have been proposed to these problems, the Globus Toolkit (GT) has proven the most persistently applicable across multiple fields, geographies, and project scales. GT resource gateway services and client libraries are used by tens of thousands of people every day to perform literally tens of millions of tasks at thousands of sites, enabling discovery across essentially every science and engineering discipline supported by the NSF. As new, innovative techniques and technologies for collaboration and scientific workflows are developed, and as new computing and instrument resources are added to the national cyberinfrastructure, these technologies and other improvements must be added and integrated into GT so that it can continue to provide an advanced and robust technology for solving scientific research problems.<br/><br/>The Sustain-GT project builds on past success to ensure that GT resource gateway services will continue to meet the challenges faced by NSF science and engineering communities. These challenges include: multiple-orders-of-magnitude increases in the volume of data generated, stored, and transmitted; much bigger computer systems and correspondingly larger and more complex computations; much faster networks; many more researchers, educators, and students engaged in data-intensive and computational research; and rapidly evolving commodity Web and Cloud computing environments. With the help of a new User Requirements Board, Sustain-GT will respond to community demands to evolve the GT resource gateway services with superior functionality, scalability, availability, reliability, and manageability.

Multipole methods are widely applied to N-body like problems where the individual interactions of a large number of distant objects can be treated as a single interaction under the appropriate conditions. This simplification eliminates the need for computing individual pairwise interactions and results in a drastic speed-up of computation. However, conventional parallel multipole methods are facing serious challenges to remain competitive as computational resources approach Exascale. Many applications employing multipole methods describe very dynamic physical processes, both in their time dependence and in their range of relevant spatial scales, while conventional implementations of multipole methods are essentially static in nature leading to computational inefficiencies. <br/>This project provides a fine-grained data-driven approach for multipole methods in order to address the limitations of conventional practices and improve scalability and efficiency. The software library employs dynamic adaptive execution methods with multipole-specific strategies for fault tolerance and exception handling while simplifying the implementation of the fast multipole method and the Barnes-Hut algorithm for end-users. The project software library immediately impacts science applications based on multipole methods by improving application scalability and efficiency and providing fault tolerance, a global address space, and an Exascale-ready execution model which integrates the entire system stack.

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450177","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

These systems range from the writhing and coiling of DNA, to the beating and pumping of cilia and flagella, to the flow of blood in the body, to the locomotion of fish, insects, and birds. This project aims to develop advanced software infrastructure for performing dynamic computer simulations of such biological and biomedical systems. To facilitate the deployment of this software in a range of scientific and engineering applications, this project will develop new software capabilities in concert with new computer models that use the software. Specific application domains to be advanced in this project include models of aquatic locomotion that can be used to understand the neural control of movement and ultimately to develop new treatments for neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injuries, and models that simulate the interaction between the electrophysiology of the heart and the contractions of the heart that pump blood throughout the body, which could lead to improved approaches to treating heart disease. The software to be developed within the project is freely available online and is used by a number of independent research groups in a variety of scientific and engineering domains. It is being actively used in projects that model different aspects of cardiovascular dynamics, such as platelet aggregation and the dynamics of natural and prosthetic heart valves, and in projects that study other biological problems, including cancer dynamics, insect flight, aquatic locomotion, and the dynamics of phytoplankton. The software is also being applied to non-biological problems, including nanoscale models of colloidal suspensions and models of active particles. The improved methods and software to be developed in this project will thereby have a broad and sustained impact on a large number of ongoing research efforts in the biological and biomedical sciences and other scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>The immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly applicable framework for modeling and simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The IB method was introduced to model the fluid dynamics of heart valves, and subsequent development initially focused on simulating cardiac fluid dynamics. This methodology is broadly useful, however, and has been applied to a variety of problems in which a fluid flow interacts with immersed structures, including elastic bodies, bodies with known or prescribed deformational kinematics, and rigid bodies. Extensions of the IB method have also been developed to model electrophysiological systems and systems with chemically active structures. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the PI has developed adaptive versions of the IB method that employ structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where needed. These methods have been implemented within the IBAMR software framework, which provides parallel implementations of the IB method and its extensions that leverage high-quality computational libraries including SAMRAI, PETSc, and libMesh. This project will further extend the IBAMR software by implementing modeling and discretization technologies required by the research applications of current and prospective users of the software, by developing improved solver infrastructure facilitated by the implementation of native support for structured AMR discretizations in the PETSc library, and by integrating with existing high-quality software tools for model development, deployment, and analysis. IBAMR is freely distributed online and is used within a number of independent research groups both to the further development of the IB method and also to its application to simulate diverse problems in fluid dynamics and FSI. By enhancing IBAMR, this project will also enhance the ability of these and other researchers to construct detailed models without requiring those researchers to develop the significant software infrastructure needed to perform such simulations. This project will also develop general-purpose support for AMR discretizations in PETSc, a software library with thousands of active users, ~400 downloads per month, and numerous applications. The work of this project will help to grow the IBAMR user community of students and researchers by developing UI tools for building models, running simulations, and analyzing results. Students will be actively engaged in all aspects of the project, including code, method, and model development.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450327","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Scalable Infrastructure for Enabling Multiscale and Multiphysics Applications in Fluid Dynamics, Solid Mechanics, and Fluid-Structure Interaction"

There is a long tradition of software packages for algebraic combinatorics. These have been crucial in the development of combinatorics since the 1960s. The originality of the Sage-Combinat project lies in successfully addressing the following simultaneous objectives. It offers a wide variety of interoperable and extensible tools, integrated in a general purpose mathematical software package, as needed for daily computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics; it is developed by a community of researchers spread around the world and across institutions; and it is open source and depends only on open source software. Among the proposers, Stein is founder and lead developer of Sage while Bump, Musiker, and Schilling are strong contributors to Sage-Combinat. Hivert and Thi�ery (Paris-Sud, Orsay), founders and lead developers of Sage-Combinat, are both strongly affiliated with this project. Some of the research areas addressed in this project include symmetric functions, in particular Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary Cartan types and their nonsymmetric analogues, crystals, rigged configurations and combinatorial R-matrices, affine Weyl groups and Hecke algebras, cluster algebras, and posets.<br/><br/>The project will develop Sage-Combinat in areas relevant to the ongoing research of the participants, together with relevant underlying infrastructure. The project will include three Sage Days workshops, and will be affiliated with a third scheduled workshop at ICERM. These workshops include a strong outreach component and have been a potent tool for connecting researchers and recruiting Sage users and developers. The grant will also fund a dedicated software development and computation server for Sage-Combinat, to be hosted in the Sage computation farm in Seattle. Emphasis will be placed on the development of thematic tutorials that will make the code accessible to new users.

However, our ability to model and quantitatively understand the complex interwoven environmental processes that control water and its availability is severely hampered by inadequate tools related to hydrologic data discovery, systems integration, modeling/ simulation, and education. This project develops sustainable cyberinfrastructure for better access to water-related data and models in the hydrologic sciences, enabling hydrologists and other associated communities to collaborate and combine data and models from multiple sources. It will provide new ways in which hydrologic knowledge is created and applied to better understand water availability, quality, and dynamics. It will also help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between natural and engineered aspects of the water cycle. These goals will be achieved through the development of interoperable cyberinfrastructure tools and the creation of an online collaborative environment, called HydroShare, which enables scientists to easily discover and access hydrologic and related data and models, retrieve them to their desktop, and perform analyses in a high performance computing environment. The software to be developed will take advantage of existing NSF cyberinfrastructure (iRODS, HUBzero, CSDMS, CUAHSI HIS) and be created as open source code. Its development will be end user-driven. In terms of broader impacts, the project builds essential infrastructure for science by developing software tools and computing environments to allow better understanding of the impacts of climate change (i.e., floods, droughts, biofuels, etc.) and to allow improved water resource development and the management of freshwater resources both above and below ground.

As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled and condensed into the building blocks of ordinary matter around us: protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei. Droplets of this fluid, which exists only at temperatures above 2 trillion Kelvin, are generated and studied in the laboratory today using collisions of high-energy heavy ions at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN. A key method to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma is the generation of high-energy quarks and gluons in the collision, which interact with the hot plasma and emerge as ""jets"" of particles that are measured by experiments. These jets provide powerful tools to study the internal structure of the plasma, analogous to tomography in medical imaging. However, interpretation of jet measurements requires sophisticated numerical modeling and simulation, and comparison of theory calculations with experimental data demands advanced statistical tools. The JETSCAPE Collaboration, an interdisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians, will develop a comprehensive software framework that will provide a systematic, rigorous approach to meet this challenge. Training programs, workshops, summer schools and MOOCs, will disseminate the expertise needed to modify and maintain this framework.<br/><br/>The JETSCAPE Collaboration will develop a scalable and portable open source software package to replace a variety of existing codes. The modular integrated software framework will consist of interacting generators to simulate (i) wave functions of the incoming nuclei, (ii) viscous fluid dynamical evolution of the hot plasma, and (iii) transport and modification of jets in the plasma. Integrated advanced statistical analysis tools will provide non-expert users with quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally intensive task, the collaboration will develop trainable emulators that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and the modification of jets. The collaboration will create this framework with a user-friendly envelope that allows for continuous modifications, updates and improvements of each of its components.

The iMoDELS SDE is being developed using model-integrated computing (MIC), a state-of-the-art powerful, well-established, extensible, community-supported, and application-hardened software engineering framework that supports scientific and engineering workflows.

Tribology involves molecular mechanisms occurring on a nanometer scale, and hence understanding tribological behavior on this scale is critical to developing new technologies for reducing wear due to friction. Deployment of iMoDELS will enable non-computational specialists to be able to evaluate, design and optimize nanoscale lubrication systems, such as hard disk drives, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), and experiments involving rheological measurements via atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and surface force apparatuses (SFAs).<br/><br/>The iMoDELS SDE brings together a unique combination of materials and computer scientists who will combine their skills to abstract the deep human expertise currently required for the development of simulation-based experiments, thus making broadly available easy-to-use tools to an empirically driven area of science and engineering (nanotribology) of rapidly growing technological importance. iMoDELS includes the creation and open dissemination of forcefield and simulation results databases that will benefit the simulation community worldwide and catalyze broad-based activity in this area. The proposed research also includes the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral researchers at the interface of tribology, computational materials sciences, and computer science. The PIs will use the iMoDELS SDE, and results from it, in presentations used in outreach to local area high school and in classes given to undergraduate students. The iMoDELS SDE will be vigorously promoted through workshops and presentations at national conferences, and via the dedicated website for development and dissemination.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1047857","fuchsia_tree","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Development of an Integrated Molecular Design Environment for Lubrication Systems (iMoDELS)"

However, the rapid evolution at the hardware level over the last few years have been unmatched by corresponding changes at the programming paradigm level. According to the consensus of several major studies, the degree of parallelism on large systems is expected to increase by several orders of magnitude. As a result, the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which has been the de-facto standard message passing paradigm, lacks an efficient and portable way of handling today's architectures. To efficiently handle such systems, MPI implementations must adopt more asynchronous and thread-friendly behaviors to perform better than they do on today?s systems. Maintaining and further enhancing MPI, one of the most widely-used communication libraries in high-performance computing, will have a far-reaching impact beyond the scientific community, and represents a critical building block for continued advances in all areas of science and engineering.<br/>The ADAPT project enhances, hardens and modernizes the Open MPI library in the context of this ongoing revolution in processor architecture and system design. It creates a viable foundation for a new generation of Open MPI components, enabling the rapid exploration of new physical capabilities, providing greatly improved performance portability, and working toward full interoperability between classes of components. More specifically, ADAPT implements fundamental software techniques that can be used in many-core systems to efficiently execute MPI-based applications and to tolerate fail-stop process failures, at scales ranging from current large systems to the extreme scale systems that are coming soon. To improve the efficiency of Open MPI, ADAPT integrates, as a core component, knowledge about the hardware architecture, and allows all layers of the software stack full access to this information. Process placement, distributed topologies, file accesses, point-to-point and collective communications can then adapt to such topological information, providing more portability. The ADAPT team is also updating the current collective communication layer to allow for a task-based collective description contained at a group-level, which in turn adjusts to the intra and inter-node topology. Planned expansion of the current code with resilient capabilities allows Open MPI to efficiently survive hard and soft error types of failures. These capabilities can be used as building blocks for all currently active fault tolerance proposals in the MPI standard body.<br/>MPI is already one of the most relevant parallel programming models, the most important brick of most parallel applications, and one of the most critical communication pieces of most other programing models. Thus, the experience of the research team and emerging capabilities can benefit all future users of these programming standards, tools, and libraries--regardless of discipline. Any improvement in the performance and capabilities of a major MPI library such as Open MPI, has tremendous potential for an immediate and dramatic impact on the application communities. In addition to improving the time to solution for their applications, it has the potential to decrease the energy usage and maximize the performance delivered by the existing execution platforms. The scale at which the Open MPI library is used in government research institutions (including universities and national laboratories), as well as in the private sector, is a major vector for a quick impact on all scientific and engineering communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339763","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Collaborative Research: ADAPT: Next Generation Message Passing Interface (MPI) Library - Open MPI"

The Science Gateway Platform (SciGaP) project will create a set of hosted infrastructure services that can be easily adopted by gateway providers to build new gateways based on robust and reliable open source tools. The proposed work will transform the way Science Gateways are constructed by significantly lowering the development overhead for communities requiring access to cyberinfrastructure, and support the efficient utilization of shared resources.<br/><br/>SciGaP will transform access to large scale computing and data resources by reducing development time of new gateways and by accelerating scientific research for communities in need of access to large-scale resources.

It is difficult to understand phenomena at both highest and lowest scales, as well as all those in between. This challenge shows up in diverse fields. One of the long-standing problems in cosmology is understanding cosmological structure formation. In computer simulations of this process the challenge is increasing grid resolution while retaining the essential physics. In all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes the challenge is simulating systems with a large number of atoms while resolving long-range interactions and having sufficiently high throughput. Such simulations are critical in understanding important biological processes and eventually designing new drugs. Another prime example of multiscale phenomena is turbulent flows, a rich and complex subject of great relevance to many of the main technological issues of the day, including climate, energy, and the management of oil and biohazards. Understanding turbulent flows is critical for design of new transportation vehicles, improving efficiency of combustion processes and managing their environment pollution. Here simulations have been historically limited, and remain so, due to extremely high computational cost, even using the high-end computational systems available to researchers today. Reducing this cost, and efficiently using the computational resources, often requires specialized expertise, as well as significant development time and cost many research groups cannot afford. This project will develop a powerful suite of critical software components to provide tools for performing simulations of multiscale phenomena. <br/><br/>The suite will implement state-of-the-art techniques for reducing communication cost, which has become the most important contributing factor to the total simulation cost, especially at larger scales. It will provide a flexible set of features that will make it usable in a great number of codes across the disciplines. In particular, the library will include user-friendly interfaces for Fourier transforms, spectral and compact differentiation in three dimensions, in addition to widely used communication routines (transposes, halo exchanges). This combination of emphasis on scalable performance and richness of features makes this suite unique among other libraries in existence today. Given the extraordinary challenge of simulations of multiscale phenomena, this library will provide a realistic path towards the Exascale. The suite will be available under an open source license. User outreach will be undertaken through the project website, mailing list, user surveys and presentations.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339773","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSE: A Petascale Numerical Library for Multiscale Phenomena Simulations"

The use of wireless sensors has also started to gain popularity among researchers other than computer engineers and scientists. Today, sensors are used to enable civil engineers to monitor the structural health of deteriorating infrastructure such as highways and bridges, farmers to develop precision-agriculture techniques, ecologists to observe wildlife in their natural habitat, geophysicists to capture seismic activity of volcanoes, and in many other application areas. However, the task of developing software applications for wireless sensors is challenging for researchers because sensors have limited technical capabilities and software implementations for sensors require meticulous procedures to provide a desired level of services (e.g., reliability, security) for applications. This situation is even further exacerbated for researchers in other fields of engineering and science (e.g., civil engineers and geophysicists) as they may not have a rigorous programming background. Therefore, to facilitate the design, development and implementation of wireless sensor applications, this project provides a new framework called PROVIZ, which integrates visualization and programming functionalities into a common platform. PROVIZ is an open-source, platform independent, modular, and extensible framework for heterogeneous wireless sensor monitoring and application development. It consists of a set of easy-to-use simplified languages (one domain specific scripting language, one icon-based drag-and-drop style visual language) and a simple programming editor for developing wireless sensor applications and a mechanism for (re)programming wireless sensor nodes remotely over-the-air by distributing the generated application image. PROVIZ has the capability to visualize wireless sensor data captured from (1) a packet sniffer, (2) a binary packet trace file (e.g., PSD format), and (3) an external simulator running a wireless sensor application. PROVIZ also has the capability to process data from multiple sniffers simultaneously to visualize a large wireless sensor deployment.<br/><br/>PROVIZ will be instrumental to scientists and engineers working with wireless sensors in many disciplines (e.g., civil engineering, ecology, agriculture). PROVIZ will allow these researchers to easily program sensors and to focus more on the tasks in their domains by significantly reducing the overhead of learning how to program sensors. The PROVIZ project will be conducted as an open source project, enabling interested software developers to benefit from and add to it. Further, a variation of PROVIZ will be used to present sensor networking concepts to middle school underrepresented minority students in Georgia. Given the proliferation of wireless sensor utilization in various engineering and science fields, it is envisioned that the success of the PROVIZ project will help contribute to the growth of the future cyber workforce in the U.S.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339781","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: A Sustainable Wireless Sensor Software Development Framework for Science and Engineering Researchers"

Tools to measure application performance in these increasingly complex environments must also increase the richness of their measurements to provide insights into the increasingly intricate ways in which software and hardware interact. The PAPI performance-monitoring library has provided a clear, portable interface to the hardware performance counters available on all modern CPUs and some other components of interest (scattered across the chip and system). Widely deployed and widely used, PAPI has established itself as fundamental software infrastructure, not only for the scientific computing community, but for many industry users of HPC as well. But the radical changes in processor and system design that have occurred over the past several years pose new challenges to PAPI and the HPC software infrastructure as a whole. The PAPI-EX project integrates critical PAPI enhancements that flow from both governmental and industry research investments, focusing on processor and system design changes that are expected to be present in every extreme scale platform on the path to exascale computing.<br/><br/>The primary impact of PAPI-EX is a direct function of the importance of the PAPI library. PAPI has been in predominant use by tool developers, major national HPC centers, system vendors, and application developers for over 15 years. PAPI-EX builds on that foundation. As important research infrastructure, the PAPI-EX project allows PAPI to continue to play its essential role in the face of the revolutionary changes in the design and scale of new systems. In terms of enhancing discovery and education, the list of partners working with PAPI-EX includes NSF computing centers, major tool developers, major system vendors, and individual community leaders, and this diverse group will help facilitate training sessions, targeted workshops, and mini-symposia at national and international meetings. Finally, the active promotion of PAPI by many major system vendors means that PAPI, and therefore PAPI-EX, will continue to deliver major benefits for government and industry in many domains.<br/><br/>PAPI-EX addresses a hardware environment in which the cores of current and future multicore CPUs share various performance-critical resources (a.k.a., 'inter-core' resources), including power management, on-chip networks, the memory hierarchy, and memory controllers between cores. Failure to manage contention for these 'inter-core' resources has already become a major drag on overall application performance. Consequently, the lack of ability to reveal the actual behavior of these resources at a low level, has become very problematic for the users of the many performance tools (e.g., TAU, HPCToolkit, Open|SpeedShop, Vampir, Scalasca, CrayPat, Active Harmony, etc.). PAPI-EX enhances and extends PAPI to solve this critical problem and prepare it to play its well-established role in HPC performance optimization. Accordingly, PAPI-EX targets the following objectives: (1) Develop shared hardware counter support that includes system-wide and inter-core measurements; (2) Provide support for data-flow based runtime systems; (3) Create a sampling interface to record streams of performance data with relevant context; (4) Combine an easy-to-use tool for text-based application performance analysis with updates to PAPI?s high-level API to create a basic, ?out of the box? instrumentation API.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450429","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Proposal: Performance Application Programming Interface for Extreme-Scale Environments (PAPI-EX)"

SimVascular is currently the only comprehensive software package that provides a complete pipeline from medical image data segmentation to patient specific blood flow simulation and analysis. This software now forms the backbone in cardiovascular simulation research in a small but active group of domestic and international academic labs. However, since its original release there have been several critical barriers preventing wider adoption by new users, application to large-scale research studies, and educational access. These include 1) the cost and complications associated with embedded commercial components, 2) the need for more efficient geometric model construction tools, 3) lack of sustainable architecture and infrastructure, and 4) a lack of organized maintenance. <br/><br/>This project is addressing the above roadblocks through the following aims: 1) create a sustainable and modular open source SimVascular 2.0 project housed at Stanford Simbios? simtk.org, with documentation, benchmarking and test suites, 2) provide alternatives to all commercial components in the first truly open source release of SimVascular, 3) improve the image segmentation methods and efficiency of model construction to enable high-throughput studies, and 4) enhance functionality by merging state of the art research in optimization, flow analysis, and multiscale modeling. The project leverages existing resources and infrastructure at simtk.org, and builds upon the significant previous investment that enabled the initial open source release of SimVascular. Access is further enhanced by cross-linking with the NIH funded Vascular Model Repository. This project will increase the user base and build a sustainable software platform supported by an active open source community. Releasing the first fully open source version of SimVascular will enable greater advances in cardiovascular medicine, provide open access to state of the art simulation tools for educational purposes, and facilitate training of young investigators.

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450405","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

Among the many uses of computational chemistry codes are to aid in the design of new materials with specific properties, to understand protein folding dynamics related to the human body, to understand the mechanisms of enzyme catalysis to produce biofuels, and to identify and characterize gaseous species in the atmosphere. Because computational chemistry simulations can require large amounts of computer, memory and disk space, one focus of this research is to reduce the demands on computer resources by exploiting methods that can efficiently fragment large molecules into smaller pieces and at the same time take advantage of computers that have many thousands of computer cores. The principal investigators are developers of several computational chemistry programs, each of which has unique functionalities that have taken multiple person-years to develop and implement. In order to minimize further development efforts and to maximize the utility of the unique features, a second key focus of this research will be to develop the ability of each program to access the unique features and data of the other programs. A major bottleneck in the effort to construct high performance computers with more and more compute cores is the power that is required to drive such systems. One way that the research team will address the power issue is to explore the utility of low power architectures, such as graphical processing units for computational chemistry calculations. All of the newly developed codes will be made available to the user community by web download at no cost.<br/><br/>This project presents an integrated computational science approach to very high quality electronic structure and dynamics calculations that will (a) be broadly accessible to both the development and applications communities, (b) have the capability to address problems of great interest, such as the properties of liquids and solvent effects, and photochemical/photobiological dynamics with high accuracy, (c) provide interoperability and sustainability into the foreseeable future, and (d) solve bottlenecks including power consumption using accelerators. A primary goal is to provide to the broad community new, accurate approaches that may be easily used, with a clear path forward to further code improvement and development. As part of the proposed effort, in addition to the usual outlets of journal articles and public presentations, the investigators will organize workshops at prominent national meetings, so that the expertise and software developed will be available to as broad a group of users as possible. All of the developed codes will be available on the web for easy downloads. The proposed research will develop new paradigms for interoperability, with a focus on the highly popular program suites GAMESS, NWChem, PSI4 and the AIMS dynamics code. Also included will be a cloud-based client-server model, a common quantum chemistry driver and novel data management approaches. The integration of the codes will be accomplished by making use of the combined expertise of the PIs in developing interoperable methods and data interfaces in computational science. In addition, several new methods will be developed, including novel explicit (R12) correlation methods that will be integrated with the most accurate levels of theory: multi-reference and the most accurate and novel coupled cluster methods, as well as the derivation and implementation of analytic derivatives. Applicability to large molecular systems will be made feasible by drawing upon novel fragmentation methods that scale nearly perfectly to the petascale.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450179","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Removing Bottlenecks in High Performance Computational Science"

Models are used to study a wide range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, flooding, plant growth, landslide occurrence, and many other processes. Models can be used to develop scientific understanding by comparing model calculations with the real world. They can also be used to make predictions about how nature will behave under certain conditions. In the areas of geosciences that deal with the earth's surface, one bottleneck in the development and use of models is the effort required to build, test, and debug the necessary software. This project contributes to scientific research and discovery by creating open source software tools that scientists can use to more efficiently create, modify, or combine computer models that represent portions of earth's surface and the processes occurring thereon. The project combines software development with user training and web-based resources, so that the products will be openly accessible, well documented, and widely disseminated within the relevant scientific communities. The project also contributes to K-12, undergraduate, and graduate-level education in computational modeling and earth-surface processes.<br/><br/>This project catalyzes research in earth-surface dynamics by developing a software framework that enables rapid creation, refinement, and reuse of two-dimensional (2D) numerical models. The phrase earth-surface dynamics refers to a remarkably diverse group of science and engineering fields that deal with our planet's surface and near-surface environment: its processes, its management, and its responses to natural and human-made perturbations. Scientists who want to use an earth-surface model often build their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their model rather than taking advantage of codes that have already been written. Whereas the end result may be novel software programs, many person-hours are lost rewriting existing code, and the resulting software is often idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and unable to interact with other software programs in the same scientific community and beyond, leading to lost opportunities for exploring an even wider array of scientific questions than those that can be addressed using a single model. The Landlab model framework seeks to eliminate these redundancies and lost opportunities, and simultaneously lower the bar for entry into numerical modeling, by creating a user- and developer-friendly software library that provides scientists with the fundamental building blocks needed for modeling earth-surface dynamics. The framework takes advantage of the fact that nearly all surface-dynamics models share a set of common software elements, despite the wide range of processes and scales that they encompass. Providing these elements in the context of a popular scientific programming environment, with strong user support and community engagement, contributes to accelerating progress in the diverse sciences of the earth's surface.<br/><br/>The Landlab modeling framework is designed so that grid creation, data storage, and sharing of data among process components is done for the user. The framework is generic enough so that the coupling of two process components, whether they are squarely within a geoscience subdiscipline, or they cross subdisciplines, is the same. This architecture makes it easy to explore a wide range of questions in the geosciences without the need for much coding. Further, the model code is primarily written in Python, a language that is relatively easy for casual programmers to learn. Because of these attributes, the Landlab modeling framework has the potential to add computational modeling to the toolbox of a wide array of geoscientists, and to clear a path for trans-disciplinary earth-surface modeling that explores societally relevant topics, such as land-cover changes in response to climate change, as well as modeling of topics that currently require the coupling of sophisticated but harder-to-use models, such as sediment source-to-sink dynamics. The project will generate several proof-of-concept studies that are interesting in their own right, and demonstrate the capabilities of the modeling framework. Community engagement is fostered by presenting clinics and demonstrations at professional venues aimed at hydrologists, sedimentologists, critical zone scientists, and the broader earth and environmental sciences community. The team also supports visits by individual scientists for on-site training beyond these clinics. Input/output tools allow compatibility with data from relevant NSF-supported research. The project supports four graduate students and three postdoctoral researchers, and also includes modeling workshops for fifth to seventh grade girls in a community that has a greater than 50% minority population.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450338","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Landlab: A Flexible, Open-Source Modeling Framework for Earth-Surface Dynamics"

These systems range from the writhing and coiling of DNA, to the beating and pumping of cilia and flagella, to the flow of blood in the body, to the locomotion of fish, insects, and birds. This project aims to develop advanced software infrastructure for performing dynamic computer simulations of such biological and biomedical systems. To facilitate the deployment of this software in a range of scientific and engineering applications, this project will develop new software capabilities in concert with new computer models that use the software. Specific application domains to be advanced in this project include models of aquatic locomotion that can be used to understand the neural control of movement and ultimately to develop new treatments for neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injuries, and models that simulate the interaction between the electrophysiology of the heart and the contractions of the heart that pump blood throughout the body, which could lead to improved approaches to treating heart disease. The software to be developed within the project is freely available online and is used by a number of independent research groups in a variety of scientific and engineering domains. It is being actively used in projects that model different aspects of cardiovascular dynamics, such as platelet aggregation and the dynamics of natural and prosthetic heart valves, and in projects that study other biological problems, including cancer dynamics, insect flight, aquatic locomotion, and the dynamics of phytoplankton. The software is also being applied to non-biological problems, including nanoscale models of colloidal suspensions and models of active particles. The improved methods and software to be developed in this project will thereby have a broad and sustained impact on a large number of ongoing research efforts in the biological and biomedical sciences and other scientific and engineering disciplines.<br/><br/>The immersed boundary (IB) method is a broadly applicable framework for modeling and simulating fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The IB method was introduced to model the fluid dynamics of heart valves, and subsequent development initially focused on simulating cardiac fluid dynamics. This methodology is broadly useful, however, and has been applied to a variety of problems in which a fluid flow interacts with immersed structures, including elastic bodies, bodies with known or prescribed deformational kinematics, and rigid bodies. Extensions of the IB method have also been developed to model electrophysiological systems and systems with chemically active structures. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the PI has developed adaptive versions of the IB method that employ structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where needed. These methods have been implemented within the IBAMR software framework, which provides parallel implementations of the IB method and its extensions that leverage high-quality computational libraries including SAMRAI, PETSc, and libMesh. This project will further extend the IBAMR software by implementing modeling and discretization technologies required by the research applications of current and prospective users of the software, by developing improved solver infrastructure facilitated by the implementation of native support for structured AMR discretizations in the PETSc library, and by integrating with existing high-quality software tools for model development, deployment, and analysis. IBAMR is freely distributed online and is used within a number of independent research groups both to the further development of the IB method and also to its application to simulate diverse problems in fluid dynamics and FSI. By enhancing IBAMR, this project will also enhance the ability of these and other researchers to construct detailed models without requiring those researchers to develop the significant software infrastructure needed to perform such simulations. This project will also develop general-purpose support for AMR discretizations in PETSc, a software library with thousands of active users, ~400 downloads per month, and numerous applications.

Negrut, Sameh, and Knepley will investigate, produce, and maintain a methodology and its software implementation that leverage emerging heterogeneous hardware architectures to solve billion-unknowns linear systems in a robust, scalable, and efficient fashion. The two classes of problems targeted under this project are banded dense and sparse general linear systems.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the observation that the task of solving a linear system is one of the most ubiquitous ingredients in the numerical solution of Applied Mathematics problems. It is relied upon for the implicit integration of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) problems, in the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems, in interior point optimization methods, in least squares approximations, in solving eigenvalue problems, and in data analysis. In fact, the vast majority of nonlinear problems in Scientific Computing are solved iteratively by drawing on local linearizations of nonlinear operators and the solution of linear systems. Recent advances in (a) hardware architecture; i.e., the emergence of General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GPU) cards, and (b) scalable solution algorithms, provide an opportunity to develop a new class of parallel algorithms, called SPIKE, which can robustly and efficiently solve very large linear systems of equations.<br/><br/>Drawing on its divide-and-conquer paradigm, SPIKE builds on several algorithmic primitives: matrix reordering strategies, dense linear algebra operations, sparse direct solvers, and Krylov subspace methods. It provides a scalable solution that can be deployed in a heterogeneous hardware ecosystem and has the potential to solve billion-unknown linear systems in the cloud or on tomorrow?s exascale supercomputers. Its high degree of scalability and improved efficiency stem from (i) optimized memory access pattern owing to an aggressive pre-processing stage that reduces a generic sparse matrix to a banded one through a novel reordering strategy; (ii) good exposure of coarse and fine grain parallelism owing to a recursive, divide-and-conquer solution strategy; (iii) efficient vectorization in evaluating the coupling terms in the divide-and-conquer stage owing to a CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing approach; and (iv) algorithmic polymorphism, given that SPIKE can serve both as a direct solver or an effective preconditioner in an iterative Krylov-type method.<br/><br/>In Engineering, SPIKE will provide the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) community with a key component; i.e., fast solution of linear systems, required by the analysis of complex problems through computer simulation. Examples of applications that would benefit from this technology are Structural Mechanics problems (Finite Element Analysis in car crash simulation), Computational Fluid Dynamics problems (solving Navier-Stokes equations in the simulation of turbulent flow around a wing profile), and Computational Multibody Dynamics problems (solving Newton-Euler equations in large granular dynamics problems).<br/><br/>SPIKE will also be interfaced to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc), a two decades old flexible and scalable framework for solving Science and Engineering problems on supercomputers. Through PETSc, SPIKE will be made available to a High Performance Computing user community with more than 20,000 members worldwide. PETSc users will be able to run SPIKE without any modifications on vastly different supercomputer architectures such as the IBM BlueGene/P and BlueGene/Q, or the Cray XT5. SPIKE will thus run scalably on the largest machines in the world and will be tuned for very different network and hardware topologies while maintaining a simple code base.<br/><br/>The experience collected and lessons learned in this project will augment a graduate level class, ?High Performance Computing for Engineering Applications? taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A SPIKE tutorial and research outcomes will be presented each year at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. A one day High Performance Computing Boot Camp will be organized each year in conjunction with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference and used to disseminate the software outcomes of this effort.

Negrut, Sameh, and Knepley will investigate, produce, and maintain a methodology and its software implementation that leverage emerging heterogeneous hardware architectures to solve billion-unknowns linear systems in a robust, scalable, and efficient fashion. The two classes of problems targeted under this project are banded dense and sparse general linear systems.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the observation that the task of solving a linear system is one of the most ubiquitous ingredients in the numerical solution of Applied Mathematics problems. It is relied upon for the implicit integration of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) problems, in the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems, in interior point optimization methods, in least squares approximations, in solving eigenvalue problems, and in data analysis. In fact, the vast majority of nonlinear problems in Scientific Computing are solved iteratively by drawing on local linearizations of nonlinear operators and the solution of linear systems. Recent advances in (a) hardware architecture; i.e., the emergence of General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GPU) cards, and (b) scalable solution algorithms, provide an opportunity to develop a new class of parallel algorithms, called SPIKE, which can robustly and efficiently solve very large linear systems of equations.<br/><br/>Drawing on its divide-and-conquer paradigm, SPIKE builds on several algorithmic primitives: matrix reordering strategies, dense linear algebra operations, sparse direct solvers, and Krylov subspace methods. It provides a scalable solution that can be deployed in a heterogeneous hardware ecosystem and has the potential to solve billion-unknown linear systems in the cloud or on tomorrow?s exascale supercomputers. Its high degree of scalability and improved efficiency stem from (i) optimized memory access pattern owing to an aggressive pre-processing stage that reduces a generic sparse matrix to a banded one through a novel reordering strategy; (ii) good exposure of coarse and fine grain parallelism owing to a recursive, divide-and-conquer solution strategy; (iii) efficient vectorization in evaluating the coupling terms in the divide-and-conquer stage owing to a CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing approach; and (iv) algorithmic polymorphism, given that SPIKE can serve both as a direct solver or an effective preconditioner in an iterative Krylov-type method.<br/><br/>In Engineering, SPIKE will provide the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) community with a key component; i.e., fast solution of linear systems, required by the analysis of complex problems through computer simulation. Examples of applications that would benefit from this technology are Structural Mechanics problems (Finite Element Analysis in car crash simulation), Computational Fluid Dynamics problems (solving Navier-Stokes equations in the simulation of turbulent flow around a wing profile), and Computational Multibody Dynamics problems (solving Newton-Euler equations in large granular dynamics problems).<br/><br/>SPIKE will also be interfaced to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc), a two decades old flexible and scalable framework for solving Science and Engineering problems on supercomputers. Through PETSc, SPIKE will be made available to a High Performance Computing user community with more than 20,000 members worldwide. PETSc users will be able to run SPIKE without any modifications on vastly different supercomputer architectures such as the IBM BlueGene/P and BlueGene/Q, or the Cray XT5. SPIKE will thus run scalably on the largest machines in the world and will be tuned for very different network and hardware topologies while maintaining a simple code base.<br/><br/>The experience collected and lessons learned in this project will augment a graduate level class, ?High Performance Computing for Engineering Applications? taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A SPIKE tutorial and research outcomes will be presented each year at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. A one day High Performance Computing Boot Camp will be organized each year in conjunction with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference and used to disseminate the software outcomes of this effort.

Many performance aspects of MPI libraries, such as latency, bandwidth, scalability, memory footprint, cache pollution, overlap of computation and communication etc. are highly dependent on system configuration and application requirements. Additionally, modern clusters are changing rapidly with the growth of multi-core processors and commodity networking technologies such as InfiniBand and 10GigE/iWARP. They are becoming diverse and heterogeneous with varying number of processor cores, processor speed, memory speed, multi-generation network adapters/switches, I/O interface technologies, and accelerators (GPGPUs), etc. Typically, any MPI library deals with the above kind of diversity in platforms and sensitivity of applications by employing various runtime parameters. These parameters are tuned during its release, or by<br/>system administrators, or by end-users. These default parameters may or may not be optimal for all system configurations and applications.<br/><br/>The MPI library of a typical proprietary system goes through heavy performance tuning for a range of applications. Since commodity clusters provide greater flexibility in their configurations (processor, memory and network), it is very hard to achieve optimal tuning using released version of any MPI library, with its default settings. This leads to the following broad challenge: ""Can a comprehensive performance tuning framework be designed for MPI library so that the next generation InfiniBand, 10GigE/iWARP and RoCE clusters and applications will be able to extract `bare-metal' performance and maximum scalability?""

Classical molecular simulations rely upon forcefields to describe the various interactions that exist between atoms and/or groups of atoms. The availability of forcefields for molecular simulation has reduced the effort researchers must devote to the difficult and costly task of determining the interactions between species, allowing them to instead focus on the motivating scientific questions. However, determining which parameters in a forcefield to use is still often a tedious and error prone task. This difficulty is related to the strong dependence of the parameters on the chemical context of the atoms; the chemical context may depend on the local bonded environment of an atom in a molecule, the local environment of neighboring atoms, the type of molecule(s) being considered, the phase of the molecule(s), etc. Forcefields can contain tens or hundreds of different types of the same element, where each type represents the element in a different chemical context. Atom typing can be challenging, often requiring the user to consult textual comments scattered in parameter files or the scientific literature where the parameters were published. Unfortunately, as of today, the documentation of a typical forcefield tends to be scarce and unstructured, commonly expressed in plain English or in an ad-hoc shorthand notation, leading to ambiguities and increasing the likelihood of incorrect usage. While there are freely available tools to aid in atom-typing, these are typically specific to a particular forcefield or simulator and capture the atom-typing and parameterization rules in ways that are hard to maintain, debug, and evolve. The central tenet of this project is that there is an imminent need in the research community for a forcefield agnostic formalism to express atom-typing and parameterization rules in a way that is expressive enough for human consumption, while being machine readable to enable automation in complex scientific workflows.<br/><br/>This work proposes to establish a formalism to express the chemical context for which a particular forcefield parameter is applicable (i.e., forcefield usage semantics) and an atom-typing tool that interprets this formalism to generate forcefield parameterizations that are provably correct. Annotating forcefields with this formalism will serve as clear, unambiguous documentation of the atom-types and parameter usage, and also allows ambiguities or inconsistencies in forcefield specifications to be programmatically pinpointed during development. Successfully developing this framework will simplify the rules needed for atom-typing, which is crucial as forcefields continue to grow, specialize, and become more complex. The machine-readable annotations of forcefield usage semantics will enable automating tedious and error prone tasks and have the potential to enable new application areas, ranging from automated forcefield comparison and cross-validation, to complex simulation workflows integrating multiple forcefields and simulator tools. ��An open online forcefield repository containing the annotated forcefields, associated open source software, and documentation on how to use, annotate, and develop forcefields within the proposed framework will be developed to disseminate results and foster community involvement. �",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1535150","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Development of a Software Framework for Formalizing Forcefield Atom-Typing for Molecular Simulation"

In order to use such accurate models, software is needed that can efficiently handle chemistry in practical simulations. This collaborative project aims to develop such tools, employing the computational power of modern parallelized central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs).

This will be achieved by (1) developing and comparing chemical kinetics integration algorithms for parallel operation on CPUs and GPUs/accelerators, (2) developing a method for detecting local stiffness due to chemical kinetics and adaptively selecting the most efficient solver based on available hardware, (3) implementing a computational cell clustering strategy to group similar spatial locations, (4) demonstrating the improved performance offered by these software elements using commercial and open-source computational fluid dynamics codes for modeling reactive flows, and (5) designing a portable and sustainable software library based on the above software elements, including building a community of users.

The big hurdle to doing this is that these methods for solving the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, known as the Schroedinger equation, are either not sufficiently accurate or are too computationally expensive. The purpose of this proposal is to develop software for a class of stochastic techniques, called quantum Monte Carlo methods, that will allow scientists and engineers to solve the equation more accurately and thereby predict materials properties with greater accuracy. The software uses a new programming paradigm to make the use as well as the extension of the software by developers easier. If researchers find this programming paradigm useful, it may propagate to a much larger research community and may eventually become an integral part of a new programming language. Thus this project will contribute to the basic sciences and potentially contribute to the field of computer science as well.<br/><br/>The goal of this proposal is to develop a software package consisting of a variety of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis tools. The software will have the capability to compute static and dynamic response properties, thereby greatly enhancing the range of applicability of QMC methods. Past research on optimizing many-body wave functions will aid in this goal since some of the formalism is the same. Both real space QMC methods, namely variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC), and, determinant space QMC methods, namely semistochastic QMC (SQMC), which is an extension of the full configuration interaction QMC (FCIQMC) method, will be included, since each of these methods is the method of choice for some set of applications. The software uses the Minimal Explicit Dependency (MED) programming paradigm that greatly facilitates the development of complex programs. In particular, it lowers the barrier for researchers, who are not familiar with the inner workings of the program to contribute new functionality, thereby contributing to the long term survival of the software.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1534965","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Quantum Monte Carlo Software for a Broad Electronic Structure Research Community via Minimal Explicit Dependency (MED) programming"

Scientists and engineers use them to perform research into air quality and pollution, dangerous biological plumes, cloud physics, cloud extent, climate models, numerical weather prediction, road weather, aviation safety, severe convective storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and movement patterns of birds, bats and insects. Radars and lidars are critical for protecting society from high impact weather and understanding the atmosphere and biosphere, but they are complex instruments that produce copious quantities of data that pose many challenges for researchers, students, and instrument developers. This project will develop a new set of tools called the Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE) to meet these challenges and help address the 'big data' problem faced by users in the research and education communities. This project will open new avenues of scientific investigation, including data assimilation to improve weather forecasts, and help to maximize returns on NSF investments in weather and climate research by providing better software tools to researchers, students, and educators. Improving the effectiveness of NSF research will provide significant scientific and societal benefits through an improved understanding of many diverse scientific topics that are relevant to public safety, national defense, and the global economy.<br/><br/>The LROSE project will develop a 'Virtual Toolbox' with a set of software tools needed for a diverse set of scientific applications. LROSE will be packaged so that it can be run on a virtual machine (VM), either locally or in the cloud, and stocked with core algorithm modules for those typical processing steps that are well understood and documented in the peer-reviewed literature. LROSE will enable the user community to use the core toolset to develop new research modules that address the specific needs of the latest scientific research. Through the VM Toolbox and a core software framework, other developers of open-source radar software can then provide their own compatible software tools to the set.

The infrastructure and modules will allow researchers to run standard procedures, thereby improving the efficiency and reproducibility of the analyses, and encourage researchers to jointly develop new scientific approaches for data analysis. The use of collaborative open source methods will lead to a suite of available algorithmic modules that will allow scientists to explore radar and lidar data in new, innovative ways.

Cancer and genetic diseases are due to altered interactions caused by mutations. Cellular organelles and viruses spontaneously build themselves from the ordered assembly of component molecules. While a complete understanding remains elusive, these and many other phenomena fundamentally rest on the ability of molecules to recognize and bind specifically to other molecules. The general principles of molecular recognition are being employed to design new drugs, chemical catalysts, and advanced materials. Computer models offer an important mean to disentangle and analyze molecular interactions and to produce quantitative predictions. The main objective of the project is to develop novel algorithms to model molecular recognition processes at atomic resolution on modern parallel computer architectures. This research seeks to increase the speed of the calculations and expand hardware support to enable the screening of larger sets of drug candidates and the study of multiple protein mutations under various conditions. The increased accuracy and availability of modeling software technologies by a larger community will lead to new ideas and research approaches, and ultimately to new discoveries in medicine, chemistry and material science. This effort will contribute to the establishment of in silico means to evaluate environmental and clinical claims. For example computational evidences on toxicity of substances can inform public policy in the same way that, for instance, atmospheric models are currently used for global climate projections.<br/><br/>The project targets the Binding Energy Distribution Analysis Method (BEDAM, for short), an accurate model of molecular binding, currently limited by computational performance.

In a wide array of disciplines ranging from astronomy and geology to environmental science and biology, digital imaging approaches are used to capture dynamic processes in great detail. In the biological sciences, digital light microscopy has transformed the field with unprecedented levels of accessibility, functionality and performance with fewer compromises. Not only have there been great advances in the hardware and software needed to collect digital images, but also in the software tools for analysis, interpretation, storage and dissemination of the images. The accessibility of digital microscopy and imaging in general has resulted not only in widespread use and adoption but in increased innovation as well, with scientist pushing the envelope in developing core technologies in new directions such as hybrid and multimodal developments. Despite the great technological advances occurring in the field by commercial and academic researchers alike, there still is a fundamental barrier in imaging research that nearly every scientist encounters in their imaging workflow: the Proprietary File Format (PFF). PFFs are what the majority of software programs use to record images and any subsequent image analysis. While there are implemented efforts to create better open microscopy formats to help reduce the number of PFFs, it is clear that one universal format for everyone is not practical. Rather, the greatest practical need facing the community is not a universal scientific imaging format, but rather a universal scientific imaging format converter. With such a system, any current or future imaging format can be supported, including conversion from any PFF to any open standard. A universal imaging converter would enable a scientist to open a PFF from any imaging system and fully parse and analyze the full image contents without the need for any proprietary software. Such a converter would not only be of great utility to biologists but also of great benefit to instrument developers, who are equally limited by the lack of transparency and access of PFFs. We propose to develop a robust scientific software element for imaging file format interoperability. This effort that we dub ""SCIFIO"" for ""Scientific Image Format Input and Output"" would build on our current successful ""Bio-Formats"" efforts to make a file converter for light microscopy in our research domain and ""harden"" these efforts to make a robust interchange library for all of biological microscopy. The system will be generalizable, extensible and adaptable to new emerging microscopy types. It will also serve as a model for adaptation to other scientific imaging types.<br/><br/>A great practical barrier to collaborative work in imaging is the issue of proprietary file formats. One of the most fundamental needs in imaging is being able to open and freely share the original pixel information and associated text information with others using any processing software or workflow desired. We are developing ""Scientific Image Format Input and Output"" (SCIFIO) a robust software package that can read and convert any proprietary image file format. By harnessing the power of a reusable software project like SCIFIO, the community will be able to freely share all content collected on any imaging system both for visualization and quantitative analysis. SCIFIO will be developed as a robust software element, both as a library anyone can utilize and as a full software tool kit that any developer can easily use to add converter support to their application freely. This is important as our target---and thus our impact---is not only on the research scientist, but the wider community including researchers from other fields, academic software developers, commercial software developers, and educators.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148362","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: SCIFIO: An Extensible Framework for Scientific Image Interoperability"

Making iMoDELS broadly accessible is motivated by the high cost (over $800B/yr in the US) of friction and wear, which, along with the methodology to overcome them, lubrication, are collectively known as tribology. Tribology involves molecular mechanisms occurring on a nanometer scale, and hence understanding tribological behavior on this scale is critical to developing new technologies for reducing wear due to friction. Deployment of iMoDELS will enable non-computational specialists to be able to evaluate, design and optimize nanoscale lubrication systems, such as hard disk drives, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), and experiments involving rheological measurements via atomic force microscopes (AFMs) and surface force apparatuses (SFAs).<br/><br/>The iMoDELS SDE brings together a unique combination of materials and computer scientists who will combine their skills to abstract the deep human expertise currently required for the development of simulation-based experiments, thus making broadly available easy-to-use tools to an empirically driven area of science and engineering (nanotribology) of rapidly growing technological importance. iMoDELS includes the creation and open dissemination of forcefield and simulation results databases that will benefit the simulation community worldwide and catalyze broad-based activity in this area.

While the ability to deploy virtual machines for cloud computing is widely supported, researchers face increasing challenges in prototyping and deploying experimental research systems that span across multiple cloud providers. In particular, providing end-to-end network connectivity among distributed virtual machines in today's Internet environment (where nodes are often constrained by firewalls and network address translators) requires significant investment of time in development, testing and maintenance of code needed solely to provide connectivity. This project addresses these connectivity challenges in cloud computing by developing an open-source scientific software element that allows researchers and users of clouds to seamlessly create virtual networks on demand for distributed virtual machines. To this end, the project creates software-defined virtual networks that support the standard Internet Protocol (IP) and use tunneling of virtual network packets over Peer-to-Peer (P2P) links among virtual machines for scalable and resilient messaging. In addition to the core IP-over-P2P virtual networking, the software provides a framework for configuration, management and monitoring that enables easy deployment of user-defined overlays for inter-cloud research experiments. <br/>The open-source software developed in this project enables advances in the state-of-the-art of research of cloud computing systems and applications. Complementary to research and development activities, this project delivers educational modules, tutorials, software packages, and pre-configured virtual machine images that allow non-expert users to deploy their own virtual networks over private, commercial and public clouds. Because cloud computing technologies are increasingly pervasive and of growing importance to the economy and society, the broader impacts of this project can reach Internet users at large who benefit from the ability to seamlessly interconnect cloud virtual machines across multiple providers. In particular, leveraging online social networking technologies, the virtual network software software enables individuals and small groups to easily create social virtual private networks connecting personal computers and multiple cloud resources.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339737","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Peer-to-Peer Overlay Virtual Network for Cloud Computing Research"

These accelerators contain myriad innovative architectural features, including explicit control of data motion, large-scale SIMD/vector processing, and multithreaded stream processing.

Math libraries have historically been in the vanguard of software that must be quickly adapted to such design revolutions because they are the common, low-level software workhorses that do all the most basic mathematical calculations for many different types of applications. The Sustained Innovation for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS) project updates two of the most widely used numerical libraries in the history of Computational Science and Engineering---LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, (abbreviated Sca/LAPACK)---enhancing and hardening them for this ongoing revolution in processor architecture and system design. SILAS creates a layered package of software components, capable of running at every level of the platform deployment pyramid, from the desktop to the largest supercomputers in the world. It achieves three complementary objectives: 1) Wherever possible, SILAS delivers seamless access to the most up-to-date algorithms, numerical implementations, and performance, by way of Sca/LAPACK programming interfaces that are familiar to many computational scientists; 2) Wherever necessary, SILAS makes advanced algorithms, numerical implementations and performance capabilities available through new interface extensions; and 3) SILAS provides a well engineered conduit through which new discoveries at the frontiers of research in these areas can be channeled as quickly as possible to all the application communities that depend on high performance linear algebra. The improvements and innovations included in SILAS derive from a variety of sources. They represent the results (including designs and well tested prototypes) of the PIs' own algorithmic and software research agenda, which has targeted multicore, hybrid and extreme scale system architectures. They are an outcome of extensive and on-going interactions with users, vendors, and the management of large NSF and DOE supercomputing facilities. They flow from cross-disciplinary engagement with other areas of computer science and engineering, anticipating the demands and opportunities of new architectures and programming models. And finally, they come from the enthusiastic participation of the research community in developing and offering enhanced versions of existing Sca/LAPACK codes.<br/><br/>The primary impact of SILAS is a direct function of the importance of the Sca/LAPACK libraries to many branches of computational science. The Sca/LAPACK libraries are the community standard for dense linear algebra and have been adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and HPC vendors. Learning to use them is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions. Application domains where Sca/LAPACK have historically been heavily used include (among a host of other examples) airplane wing design, radar cross-section studies, flow around ships and other off-shore constructions, diffusion of solid bodies in a liquid, noise reduction, and diffusion of light through small particles. Moreover, the list of application partners working with SILAS to enhance and transform these libraries for next generation platforms expands this traditional list to include quantum chemistry, adaptive mesh refinement schemes, computational materials science, geophysical flows, stochastic simulation and database research for ""big data"". No other numerical library can claim this breadth of integration with the community. Thus, there is every reason to believe that enhancing these libraries with state of the art methods and algorithms and adapting them for new and emerging platforms (reaching up to extreme scale), will have a correspondingly large impact on the research and education community, government laboratories, and private industry.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339676","fuchsia_tree","SI2 SSI: Collaborative Research: Sustained Innovations for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS)"

Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation.

Exploiting this new generation of data is difficult because the data sets they produce are sufficiently complex and large as to demand new approaches to data processing that lag far behind developments in instrumentation. A growing community is working to rectify this state-of-affairs. This project will deliver software tools that will aggregate data from the new instruments into images of large scale regions of the sky so that astronomers can fully study scientific questions such as those identified above. This approach of studying aggregated images, or mosaics, is a powerful tool in astronomy. The project will deliver the next generation of an existing mosaic-building engine, Montage, which is in wide use in astronomy and in educational activities. It will support processing of the new data sets such that they can be visualized in immersive tools such as the World Wide Telescope, widely used in developing innovative approaches to education, and such that that they can generate data used by Citizen Science services such as Zooniverse. Montage will come be bundled with a set of tools that will enable astronomers to process massive collections images on powerful ""cloud computing"" platforms. These tools will be applicable to many data-intensive problems in fields such as earthquake prediction, DNA sequencing, and climate modeling. Finally, Montage is in wide use in developing and testing national cyberinfrastructure to benefit the U.S. science community. We anticipate that the next-generation Montage will be used in the same way to develop ever more powerful cyberinfrastructure as data volumes grow rapidly in all fields.<br/><br/>In greater detail, the project will deliver the next generation of the Montage image mosaic engine, which will offer new capabilities that respond to the changing astronomy data and computing landscapes. These capabilities, requested by the user community, are: 1. Support for mosaicking of data cubes, now routinely generated by modern instrumentation; 2. Support for two widely used sky-partitioning schemes, HEALPix and TOAST; 3. An API to enable users to call Montage directly in Python and other languages. The work to develop memory management and subsetting techniques to support mosaicking will be available for others to use and extend. Support for HEALPix will enable integration and analysis of far-infrared, cosmic background data sets with other image data sets. TOAST will enable essentially any image data set to be incorporated into the WWT. Montage will be bundled with a turnkey package of open source tools that provision resources and run applications on cloud platforms. This package will build on knowledge gained in creating data products at scale with cloud platforms. These tools will bring cloud computing to scientists who have little system configuration knowledge, one of the biggest barriers to entry; these tools are general purpose and will be applicable to data intensive applications in may fields. Thus Montage will provide powerful new capabilities to astronomers, to projects analyzing data at scale to create new data products, and to scientists in data-intensive fields outside astronomy. The next-generation toolkit will inherit the sustainable Montage architecture, which has attracted a large user base among astronomers, E/PO specialists, and computer technologists. Montage is written in C, is portable across all common Unix platforms, highly scalable and delivered as components that are easy to incorporate into pipelines and processing environments. Montage is the only mosaic engine with all these characteristics. The project will use the evolutionary delivery lifecycle model. The code will be a made accessible on the GitHub repository, and released as Open Source code with a BSD 3-clause license.

To facilitate the deployment of this software in a range of scientific and engineering applications, this project will develop new software capabilities in concert with new computer models that use the software. Specific application domains to be advanced in this project include models of aquatic locomotion that can be used to understand the neural control of movement and ultimately to develop new treatments for neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injuries, and models that simulate the interaction between the electrophysiology of the heart and the contractions of the heart that pump blood throughout the body, which could lead to improved approaches to treating heart disease.

The IB method was introduced to describe the fluid dynamics of heart valves, but this methodology has also been applied to a wide range of problems in biological and non-biological fluid dynamics. The IB method typically requires high spatial resolution to resolve the viscous boundary layers at fluid-structure interfaces and, at higher Reynolds numbers, to resolve vortices shed from such interfaces. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the principal investigator has developed an adaptive version of the IB method that employs block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where it is needed. IBAMR software is a distributed-memory parallel implementation of this adaptive scheme. The key goal of this project is to make IBAMR the unifying software framework for users of the IB method, thereby establishing a community of researchers who employ a common software infrastructure for biofluids model development and simulation. The project aims to enhance IBAMR substantially by (1) developing and implementing implicit IB schemes that will allow for the efficient use of large numerical timesteps; (2) developing and implementing extensions of the basic IB methodology, including a new variable-viscosity version of the IB method, and an existing stochastic version for microscale and nanoscale problems in which Brownian motion is important; (3) optimizing IBAMR for use with modern as well as projected-future high performance computing systems comprised of multi-core compute nodes interconnected by a high-speed network; and (4) developing front-end tools for model construction, validation, and execution, thereby facilitating the adoption and use of IBAMR, especially by students and researchers with limited computational experience.<br/><br/>From the writhing and coiling of DNA, to the beating and pumping motions of cilia and flagella, to the flow of blood in the heart and throughout the circulation, coupled fluid-structure systems are ubiquitous in biology and physiology.

This project will enhance the IBAMR software substantially, extending the range of problems to which it may be applied, and improving the methods implemented within the software as well as the efficiency of the implementation. The work of this project will extend greatly the community of students and researchers who are able to use IBAMR to model biological fluid-structure interaction, in part by implementing graphical software tools for building IB models and running IB simulations.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1460334","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Parallel and Adaptive Simulation Infrastructure for Biological Fluid-Structure Interaction"

However, the computer systems that complex scientific applications run on are continuously updated by administrators to add new capabilities, fix bugs, and plug security holes. These are necessary changes, but a user needs to know if ""something changed in the system that will break his/her code"". A similar question arises when running a code on a different computer from which it was compiled or developed: ""does the new system have all the necessary support software to run my applications?"" This proposal describes a plan for developing the software capability to both statically and dynamically ""fingerprint"" a scientific application to answer those two questions and therefore test for compatibility of new system or determine if a new update could have deleterious effects. Our proposed software system will have five major components: fingerprint format, static analysis of an application to create one type of fingerprint, a system verifier that checks if a system satisfies the needs defined in a fingerprint, dynamic analysis to find applications dependencies only detectable at run time, and a composer capability to automatically define a Rocks cluster managed system that will fulfill the requirements of a specific fingerprint. All software developed will be open-source and freely available.<br/><br/>Nearly every person who uses a computer has seen messages similar to ""new updates have been installed, you must restart your computer."" Sometimes, applications break because of these updates. This proposal's broader impact is that, for a wide variety of scientific applications, we will be able to determine if a new system or an existing system is compatible by verifying the code's fingerprint. Since, scientific applications can be very sensitive to underlying software changes, it will be possible to detect incompatibility before wasting time and energy to run a large-scale application on an production systems. When these applications are used as the basis of scientific discovery, it becomes even more imperative that we view the computing environment and application together as an experimental apparatus whose configuration we need to better understand. We believe that the composer capability of this proposal can have the transformational impact by developing fully- descriptive catalogs of what an application needs to function properly. In the era in which simulation output is being used to drive policy, this kind of scientific reproducibility has impact well beyond the notions of academic completeness.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148473","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Fingerprinting Scientific Codes to Verify and Create Compatible System Software Environments"

It is difficult to use cloud computing resources for large-scale, high throughput ensemble jobs however. Additionally, the computationally oriented researcher is increasingly encouraged to make data sets available to the broader community. For the latter to be achieved, using capture tools during experimentation to harvest metadata and provenance reduces the manual burden of marking up results. Better automatic capture of metadata and provenance is the only means by which sharing of scientific data can scale to meet the burgeoning explosion of data.<br/><br/>This project develops a pipeline framework for running ensemble simulations on the cloud; the framework has two key components: ensemble deployment and metadata harvest. Regarding the former, on commercial cloud platforms typically a much smaller number of jobs than desired can be started at any one time. An ensemble run will need to be pipelined to a cloud resource, that is, executed in well-controlled batches over a period of time. We will use platform features of Azure, and employ machine learning techniques to continuously refine the pipeline submission strategy and workflow strategies for ensemble parameter specification, pipelined deployment, and metadata capture. Regarding the latter key component, we expect to reduce the burden of sharing scientific datasets resulting from the use of cloud resources through automatic metadata and provenance capture and representation that aligns the metadata with emerging best practices in data sharing and discovery. Ensemble simulations result in complex data sets, whose reuse could be increased by expressive, granule and collection level metadata, including the lineage of the resulting products, to contribute towards trust.<br/><br/>In this project we focus on a compelling and timely application from climate research: One of the more immediate and dangerous impacts of climate change could be a change in the strength of storms that form over the oceans. In addition, as sea level rises due to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps, coastal communities will become increasingly vulnerable to storm surge. There have already been indications that even modest changes in ocean surface temperature can have a disproportionate effect on hurricane strength and the damage inflicted by these storms. In an effort to understand these impacts, modelers turn to predictions generated by hydrodynamic coastal ocean models such as the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The proposed research advances the knowledge and understanding of probabilistic storm surge products by enhancements to the SLOSH model itself and through mechanisms that take advantage of commercial cloud resources. This knowledge is expected to have application in research, the classroom, and in operational settings.<br/><br/>The broader significance of the project is several-fold. Cloud computing is an important economic driver but it remains difficult for use in computationally driven scientific research. This project lowers the barriers to conducting e-Science research that utilizes cloud resources, specifically Azure. It will contribute tools to help researchers share, preserve, and publicize the scientific data sets that result from their research. Because we focus on and improve an application that predicts storm surge in response to sea level changes and severe storms, our work contributes to societal responses and adaptations to climate change, including planning and building the sustainable, hazard-resilient coastal communities of the future.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148359","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research SI2 SSE: Pipeline Framework for Ensemble Runs on Clouds"

As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled and condensed into the building blocks of ordinary matter around us: protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei. Droplets of this fluid, which exists only at temperatures above 2 trillion Kelvin, are generated and studied in the laboratory today using collisions of high-energy heavy ions at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN. A key method to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma is the generation of high-energy quarks and gluons in the collision, which interact with the hot plasma and emerge as ""jets"" of particles that are measured by experiments. These jets provide powerful tools to study the internal structure of the plasma, analogous to tomography in medical imaging. However, interpretation of jet measurements requires sophisticated numerical modeling and simulation, and comparison of theory calculations with experimental data demands advanced statistical tools. The JETSCAPE Collaboration, an interdisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians, will develop a comprehensive software framework that will provide a systematic, rigorous approach to meet this challenge. Training programs, workshops, summer schools and MOOCs, will disseminate the expertise needed to modify and maintain this framework.<br/><br/>The JETSCAPE Collaboration will develop a scalable and portable open source software package to replace a variety of existing codes. The modular integrated software framework will consist of interacting generators to simulate (i) wave functions of the incoming nuclei, (ii) viscous fluid dynamical evolution of the hot plasma, and (iii) transport and modification of jets in the plasma. Integrated advanced statistical analysis tools will provide non-expert users with quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally intensive task, the collaboration will develop trainable emulators that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and the modification of jets. The collaboration will create this framework with a user-friendly envelope that allows for continuous modifications, updates and improvements of each of its components. The effort will serve as a template for other fields that involve complex dynamical modeling and comparison with large data sets.

It is difficult to understand phenomena at both highest and lowest scales, as well as all those in between. This challenge shows up in diverse fields. One of the long-standing problems in cosmology is understanding cosmological structure formation. In computer simulations of this process the challenge is increasing grid resolution while retaining the essential physics. In all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of enzymes the challenge is simulating systems with a large number of atoms while resolving long-range interactions and having sufficiently high throughput. Such simulations are critical in understanding important biological processes and eventually designing new drugs. Another prime example of multiscale phenomena is turbulent flows, a rich and complex subject of great relevance to many of the main technological issues of the day, including climate, energy, and the management of oil and biohazards. Understanding turbulent flows is critical for design of new transportation vehicles, improving efficiency of combustion processes and managing their environment pollution. Here simulations have been historically limited, and remain so, due to extremely high computational cost, even using the high-end computational systems available to researchers today. Reducing this cost, and efficiently using the computational resources, often requires specialized expertise, as well as significant development time and cost many research groups cannot afford. This project will develop a powerful suite of critical software components to provide tools for performing simulations of multiscale phenomena. <br/><br/>The suite will implement state-of-the-art techniques for reducing communication cost, which has become the most important contributing factor to the total simulation cost, especially at larger scales. It will provide a flexible set of features that will make it usable in a great number of codes across the disciplines. In particular, the library will include user-friendly interfaces for Fourier transforms, spectral and compact differentiation in three dimensions, in addition to widely used communication routines (transposes, halo exchanges). This combination of emphasis on scalable performance and richness of features makes this suite unique among other libraries in existence today.

Burgeoning sets of eukaryotic genome sequences provide the foundation for a new spectrum of investigations into the functional and evolutionary consequences of gene and genome duplication, as well as the means to clarify knowledge of relationships among particular genes. The current software can only align small numbers of genomes; and layers of duplicated blocks produced by different genome duplication events are not readily deconvoluted, thus failing to provide crucial information toward understanding evolutionary trajectories of genomes and gene families. The enhanced software will mitigate these limitations.<br/><br/>The enhanced software will greatly help researchers to reconstruct the evolutionary trajectories of genomes and gene families, including the singularly challenging genomes of angiosperms and other taxa that have experienced polyploidization events. In particular, multiple alignment (of an expanded number of genomes) will be preceded by a multiple-way comparison of homologous regions at the DNA level, which will provide a holographic grasp of layers of homology produced by different duplication events. To reflect the evolutionary trajectories of structural changes, genomes will be input in a stepwise manner, with those of simple structures first. The resulting multiple alignment will much more accurately depict evolutionary relationships between chromosomal regions from diverse genomes, and easily be visualized and understood by users. The core part of the software will be implemented using the C++ programming language while the visualization module will be developed in Python language. The multiple and pairwise alignment information will be stored in MySQL or SQLite databases. The software will be tamed to work under multiple operating systems, including MS Windows, UNIX and Linux.

Math libraries have historically been in the vanguard of software that must be quickly adapted to such design revolutions because they are the common, low-level software workhorses that do all the most basic mathematical calculations for many different types of applications. The Sustained Innovation for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS) project updates two of the most widely used numerical libraries in the history of Computational Science and Engineering---LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, (abbreviated Sca/LAPACK)---enhancing and hardening them for this ongoing revolution in processor architecture and system design. SILAS creates a layered package of software components, capable of running at every level of the platform deployment pyramid, from the desktop to the largest supercomputers in the world. It achieves three complementary objectives: 1) Wherever possible, SILAS delivers seamless access to the most up-to-date algorithms, numerical implementations, and performance, by way of Sca/LAPACK programming interfaces that are familiar to many computational scientists; 2) Wherever necessary, SILAS makes advanced algorithms, numerical implementations and performance capabilities available through new interface extensions; and 3) SILAS provides a well engineered conduit through which new discoveries at the frontiers of research in these areas can be channeled as quickly as possible to all the application communities that depend on high performance linear algebra. The improvements and innovations included in SILAS derive from a variety of sources. They represent the results (including designs and well tested prototypes) of the PIs' own algorithmic and software research agenda, which has targeted multicore, hybrid and extreme scale system architectures. They are an outcome of extensive and on-going interactions with users, vendors, and the management of large NSF and DOE supercomputing facilities. They flow from cross-disciplinary engagement with other areas of computer science and engineering, anticipating the demands and opportunities of new architectures and programming models. And finally, they come from the enthusiastic participation of the research community in developing and offering enhanced versions of existing Sca/LAPACK codes.<br/><br/>The primary impact of SILAS is a direct function of the importance of the Sca/LAPACK libraries to many branches of computational science. The Sca/LAPACK libraries are the community standard for dense linear algebra and have been adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and HPC vendors. Learning to use them is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions. Application domains where Sca/LAPACK have historically been heavily used include (among a host of other examples) airplane wing design, radar cross-section studies, flow around ships and other off-shore constructions, diffusion of solid bodies in a liquid, noise reduction, and diffusion of light through small particles. Moreover, the list of application partners working with SILAS to enhance and transform these libraries for next generation platforms expands this traditional list to include quantum chemistry, adaptive mesh refinement schemes, computational materials science, geophysical flows, stochastic simulation and database research for ""big data"". No other numerical library can claim this breadth of integration with the community. Thus, there is every reason to believe that enhancing these libraries with state of the art methods and algorithms and adapting them for new and emerging platforms (reaching up to extreme scale), will have a correspondingly large impact on the research and education community, government laboratories, and private industry.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339822","fuchsia_tree","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Sustained Innovation for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS)"

This project is motivated by this national commitment to supercomputing research and the increasing availability of many-core computing hardware from workstations to supercomputers. Today scientists and engineers have access to extreme-scale computing resources. However, many legacy codes do not take advantage of recent innovations in computing hardware, and there is a lack of open-source simulation science software that can effectively leverage the many-core computing paradigm. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers have advanced many fields such as aerospace engineering and atmospheric sciences. Many current open-source CFD models and numerical weather prediction models do not take full advantage of the superior compute performance of graphics processing units (GPUs). By creating an open-source community model that can execute on multi-GPU workstations and large GPU clusters, the project team expects to broaden the use of high-performance computing in fluid dynamics applications. The immediate target application is wind modeling over complex terrain, to support research and development in wind resource assessment, power forecasting, atmospheric research, and air pollution. Through this project, the PIs will continue to transfer and expand the knowledge bases in GPU computing, computational mathematics, and software engineering to new students. Skill sets that transcend traditional disciplines are highly prized by national laboratories as there is a critical shortage of workforce who can conduct scientific research using supercomputers. Students and postdoctoral researchers who are involved in this project will contribute toward this critical workforce. <br/><br/>This project brings together engineers, applied mathematicians, and computer scientists. The entire suite of software elements will be designed for GPU clusters with an MPI-CUDA implementation that overlaps computation with communications using a three-dimensional decomposition for enhanced scalability. The implementation will balance performance and further development and ownership by a broader community of academic researchers. The team will follow modern software engineering practices for concurrent applications. An adaptive mesh refinement strategy that can scale on GPU clusters will be developed. A novel projection method based on radial basis functions will impose the divergence-free constraint on a hierarchy of adaptively refined grids. Software elements will be tested using unit testing and verification techniques for concurrent programs, and against data available from benchmark numerical problems. The flow solver will include modules for the immersed boundary approach for arbitrarily complex terrain and the dynamic large-eddy simulation technique. The software implementation and syntax will be intuitive to allow contributions from a larger community. The project team expects the proposed software to help reduce modeling errors with very high resolution simulations and contribute toward a fundamental understanding of turbulent winds over complex terrain.

In materials science, they enable the computational (""in silico"") design of new materials with improved properties. In biological or pharmacological research, they provide molecular-level insights into the function of macromolecules or drugs. In the search for new energy solutions, they give molecular-level insights into new solar cell designs, catalytic processes, and many others. A key bottleneck in many applications and calculations is the ""cubic scaling wall"" of the so-called Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem with system size (i.e., the effort increases by a factor of 1,000 if the model size increases by a factor of 10). This project will establish an open source software infrastructure ""ELSI"" that offers a common, practical interface to initially three complementary solution strategies to alleviate or overcome the difficulty associated with solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem. ELSI will enable a broad range of end user communities, centered around different codes with, often, unique features that tie a specialized group of scientists to that particular solution, to easily incorporate state-of-the-art solution strategies for a key problem they all share. By providing these effective, accessible solution strategies, we will open up major areas for electronic structure theory where DFT based predictive methodologies are not applicable today. This will in turn open doors for new development in materials science, chemistry, and all related areas. Commitments to support ELSI exist from some of the most important electronic structure developer communities, as well as from industry and government leaders in high-performance computing. Thus, we will create a strong U.S. based infrastructure that leverages the large user and developer base from a globally active community developing DFT methods for materials research.<br/><br/>ELSI will support and enhance three state-of-the-art approaches, each best suited for a specific problem range: (i) The ELPA (EigensoLvers for Petascale Applications) library, a leading library for efficient, massively parallel solution of eigenvalue problems (for small- and mid-sized problems up to several 1,000s of atoms), (ii) the OMM (Orbital Minimization Method) in a recent re-implementation, which circumvents the eigenvalue problem by focusing on a reduced, auxiliary problem (for systems in the several 1,000s of atoms range), and (iii) the PEXSI (Pole EXpansion and Selective Inversion) library, a proven reduced scaling (at most quadratic scaling) solution for general systems (for problems with 1,000s of atoms and beyond). By establishing standardized interfaces in a style already familiar to many electronic structure developers, ELSI will enable production electronic structure codes that use it to significantly reduce the ""scaling wall"" of the eigenvalue problem. First, ELSI will help them make efficient use of the most powerful computational platforms available. The target platforms are current massively parallel computers and multicore architectures, GPU based systems and future manycore processors. Second, the project will make targeted methodological improvements to ELPA, OMM, and PEXSI, e.g., a more effective use of matrix sparsity towards very large systems. The focus on similar computational architectures and similar methodological enhancements will lead to significant cross-fertilization and synergy between these approaches.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450372","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: ELSI-Infrastructure for Scalable Electronic Structure Theory"

This research represents a forward-looking and pragmatic approach that will lead to the discovery of the key principles for effective data and resource management for multiprocessor application development. In the course of this project the PI will create new methodologies and tools for the design, verification, and effective use of lock-free and wait-free data structures and algorithms. The proposed methodology will allow for the construction and use of lightweight multiprocessor algorithms with minimal overhead by supporting only the minimal set of operations and guarantees required by the user's application. The ideas advanced in this work will allow first-of-a-kind technology that will deliver immense boost in performance and software reuse; thus productivity will increase for developers of commercial and scientific applications. This research will pave the way for tool-based specification and verification of nonblocking algorithms, which will help reliability of multiprocessor programs. <br/><br/>This work will create novel multiprocessor data structures that provide wait-free and lock-free progress. A concurrent object is lock-free if it guarantees that some thread makes progress. A wait-free algorithm guarantees that all threads make progress, thus eliminating performance bottlenecks and entire classes of safety hazards such as starvation, deadlock, and order violations. Unlike a sequential data structure, a concurrent container must maintain correctness when multiple threads are performing its operations. Achieving this correctness adversely affects the complexity and performance of the operations. As a result, users of concurrent containers are often forced to sacrifice functionality or safety guarantees to achieve desired performance. Here, the PI will introduce the use of alternative function models that will deliver high performance in parts of the program that require less functionality and more functionality in other fragments of the program that need it. The deliverables of this research include: a collection of formally verified multiprocessor data structure designs including queues, vectors, ring buffers, sets, and hash maps; a wait-free database; a multiple resource lock manager; a set of unified concurrent APIs to assist the end users of the data structures; and a technique for specification of the key progress and correctness properties of these containers.

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450195","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

A large variety of scientific applications in use today are based on MPI. On the current and next-generation High-End Computing (HEC) systems, it is essential to understand the interaction between time-critical applications and the underlying MPI implementations in order to better optimize them for both scalability and performance. Current users of HEC systems develop their applications with high-performance MPI implementations, but analyze and fine tune the behavior using standalone performance tools. Essentially, each software component views the other as a blackbox, with little sharing of information or access to capabilities that might be useful in optimization strategies. Lack of a standardized interface that allows interaction between the profiling tool and the MPI library has been a big impediment. The newly introduced MPI_T interface in the MPI-3 standard provides a simple mechanism that allows MPI implementers to expose variables representing configuration parameters or performance measurements from within the implementation for the benefit of tools, tuning frameworks, and other support libraries. However, few performance analysis and tuning tools take advantage of the MPI_T interface and none do so to dynamically optimize at execution time. This research and development effort aims to build a software infrastructure for MPI performance engineering using the new MPI_T interface.<br/><br/>With the adoption of MPI_T in the MPI standard, it is now possible to take positive steps to realize close interaction between and integration of MPI libraries and performance tools. This research, undertaken by a team of computer scientists from OSU and UO representing the open source MVAPICH and TAU projects, aims to create an open source integrated software infrastructure built on the MPI_T interface which defines the API for interaction and information interchange to enable fine grained performance optimizations for HPC applications. The challenges addressed by the project include: 1) enhancing existing support for MPI_T in MVAPICH to expose a richer set of performance and control variables; 2) redesigning TAU to take advantage of the new MPI_T variables exposed by MVAPICH; 3) extending and enhancing TAU and MVAPICH with the ability to generate recommendations and performance engineering reports; 4) proposing fundamental design changes to make MPI libraries like MVAPICH ``reconfigurable'' at runtime; and 5) adding support to MVAPICH and TAU for interactive performance engineering sessions. The framework will be validated on a variety of HPC benchmarks and applications. The integrated middleware and tools will be made publicly available to the community. The research will have a significant impact on enabling optimizations of HPC applications that have previously been difficult to provide.

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450170","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

Many performance aspects of MPI libraries, such as latency, bandwidth, scalability, memory footprint, cache pollution, overlap of computation and communication etc. are highly dependent on system configuration and application requirements. Additionally, modern clusters are changing rapidly with the growth of multi-core processors and commodity networking technologies such as InfiniBand and 10GigE/iWARP. They are becoming diverse and heterogeneous with varying number of processor cores, processor speed, memory speed, multi-generation network adapters/switches, I/O interface technologies, and accelerators (GPGPUs), etc. Typically, any MPI library deals with the above kind of diversity in platforms and sensitivity of applications by employing various runtime parameters. These parameters are tuned during its release, or by<br/>system administrators, or by end-users. These default parameters may or may not be optimal for all system configurations and applications.<br/><br/>The MPI library of a typical proprietary system goes through heavy performance tuning for a range of applications. Since commodity clusters provide greater flexibility in their configurations (processor, memory and network), it is very hard to achieve optimal tuning using released version of any MPI library, with its default settings. This leads to the following broad challenge: ""Can a comprehensive performance tuning framework be designed for MPI library so that the next generation InfiniBand, 10GigE/iWARP and RoCE clusters and applications will be able to extract `bare-metal' performance and maximum scalability?""

Many performance aspects of MPI libraries, such as latency, bandwidth, scalability, memory footprint, cache pollution, overlap of computation and communication etc. are highly dependent on system configuration and application requirements. Additionally, modern clusters are changing rapidly with the growth of multi-core processors and commodity networking technologies such as InfiniBand and 10GigE/iWARP. They are becoming diverse and heterogeneous with varying number of processor cores, processor speed, memory speed, multi-generation network adapters/switches, I/O interface technologies, and accelerators (GPGPUs), etc. Typically, any MPI library deals with the above kind of diversity in platforms and sensitivity of applications by employing various runtime parameters. These parameters are tuned during its release, or by<br/>system administrators, or by end-users. These default parameters may or may not be optimal for all system configurations and applications.<br/><br/>The MPI library of a typical proprietary system goes through heavy performance tuning for a range of applications. Since commodity clusters provide greater flexibility in their configurations (processor, memory and network), it is very hard to achieve optimal tuning using released version of any MPI library, with its default settings. This leads to the following broad challenge: ""Can a comprehensive performance tuning framework be designed for MPI library so that the next generation InfiniBand, 10GigE/iWARP and RoCE clusters and applications will be able to extract `bare-metal' performance and maximum scalability?""

These phenomena often involve the physics of radiation transport. For example, neutrino radiation hydrodynamics is a key element of the physics governing environments with hot and dense nuclear matter. Such extreme environments include the Early Universe, during primordial nucleosynthesis of light nuclei such as hydrogen through lithium just after the Big Bang; the merger through inspiraling of neutron star-neutron star or neutron star-black hole binaries; and the death throes of massive stars, more than ten times the mass of the Sun, in stellar explosions known as core-collapse supernovae, which are responsible for elements such as oxygen and calcium without which life as we know it would not exist. Radiation transport and kinetic theory of particles besides neutrinos---photons, electrons, or neutrons---are also relevant to many areas of astrophysics, as well as a broad range of other science applications, including materials science, plasma physics, neutron transport, multiphase flows, and high-energy-density physics. As such, the availability of a software element to solve radiation transport problems is highly valuable to researchers.<br/><br/>This project will create and deploy a software element to solve radiation hydrodynamics problems on modern supercomputers featuring ""hybrid"" architectures that include traditional CPUs plus ""accelerators"" or ""coprocessors,"" such as GPUs or Intel Many Integrated Core processors, respectively. This radiation hydrodynamics functionality will be developed within GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System), a new framework being developed to facilitate the simulation of astrophysical phenomena on the world's leading capability supercomputers. In particular, the radiation transport solver will utilize the extant capabilities of GenASiS for adaptive computational ""mesh refinement,"" whereby the representation of the natural continuum is captured adaptively on a mesh of points foundational to any computational model in order to maximize the fidelity of the computational model for a given computational cost. We will use the so-called M1 approach, solving directly for the zeroth and first angular moments (energy density and momentum) of the radiation field, with higher-order moments given by ""closure relations,"" expressing them in terms of the zeroth and first moments. The energy dependence of the radiation field will be retained, with the zeroth and first angular moments discretized into ""energy bins."" Our computational approach to neutrino radiation transport will be an ""implicit-explicit"" (IMEX) scheme. Interactions between radiation and matter will be handled with a time-implicit subsolver, which will involve the inversion of dense matrices local to each node of the machine to exploit all available hardware in the node, including accelerators and coprocessors when available.

This 'Big Data' is transforming the process of scientific discovery. However, many scientific workflows require that the data be transferred, via networks like the Internet, to an optimal location for analysis and collaboration. Unfortunately, scientists often encounter performance problems on these networks. To resolve these problems, researchers depend on the expertise of engineers at Network Operations Centers (NOCs) for diagnosis and resolution. Resolving these problems often requires a cycle of interactions between the user and engineer that can last for days if not weeks, seriously hindering the scientific workflow. This project, known as TestRig 2.0, will short circuit this cycle by deploying a simple, easy to use system that will automatically collect a wide variety of important network diagnostic information. TestRig 2.0 will distribute dynamically generated test environments that are tuned to the specific needs of NOC engineers. TestRig 2.0 will automatically runs a series of tests against the infrastructure, collect the results, and transfer them back to the NOC engineer. TestRig 2.0 will also conducted a coarse analysis of the collected data so as to give the engineers some initial insight into the collected metrics.<br/><br/>In this project, researchers at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) propose to build a system, TestRig 2.0, that will quickly and easily gather a wide range of important network diagnostic information. This system includes a centralized management server that dynamically creates and configures client optical disk image files (as defined by ISO 9660). This server will be at PSC; it will provide TestRig 2.0 services to multiple geographically diverse NOCs via a free subscription model. These bootable images will provide a known good TCP stack configuration and system environment. TestRig 2.0 will use this baseline environment to perform tests against the perfSONAR monitoring infrastructure and also collect other pertinent data. The resulting data will undergo an initial automated coarse analysis by the client in order to provide engineers initial insight into the data. The resulting analysis and raw data will then be packaged and transferred back to the appropriate NOC for analysis. The client ISO creation process will include a unique dynamically generated public/private key pair. This key pair will be used for the authentication of the client ISO, distribution management, and user/test management. The rapid collection of pertinent data will enhance the process of scientific discovery by allowing researchers to focus on their research, instead of running tests for network engineers.

These patterns have been very productive because they are a natural ""common language"" in which application scientists can express their computations, and for which computer scientists can provide optimized libraries, domain specific languages, compilers, and other software tools.<br/><br/>This project will design an institute focused on a subset of these patterns --- structured grid discretizations of partial differential equations and particle methods, along with the linear and nonlinear solvers that enable their effective use --- with the specific goals of providing simulation capabilities for a set of scientific domains that make heavy use of these patterns. Two major components are envisioned to this proposed institute, called the Institute for High-Performance Computational Science with Structured Meshes and Particles (HPCS-SMP). The first component is a software infrastructure development activity that will be performed by a team whose expertise spans the design and development of mathematical algorithms and software frameworks, as well as the design and development of compilers, runtime systems, and tools that enable one to obtain high performance from emerging multicore and heterogeneous architectures. The second component is an outreach activity, in which algorithms, libraries, and software frameworks developed by the institute will be customized and integrated into simulation codes for stakeholder application domains. At the heart of this activity will be collaborations and partnerships, in which the institute will provide one or more software developers to collaborate with application scientists over a period of months to years to develop a new simulation capability or enhance an existing one.<br/><br/>The design of this institute will be carried out through a series of workshops, each focused on one of five stakeholder science domains that have been identified as using these motifs and that play a central role in various NSF Grand Challenge problems, with participation of both representatives of the science domain and the the relevant mathematics and computer science communities.

Some endeavors may even start from information not being available and accessible in digital form, and when it is available, it is often in non-structured form, not compatible with analytics tools that require structured and uniformly-formatted data. Two main methods to deal with the volume and variety of data as well as to accelerate the rate of digitization have been to apply crowdsourcing or machine-learning solutions. However, very little has been done to simultaneously take advantage of both types of solutions, and to make it easier for different efforts to share and reuse developed software elements.

Even though HuMaIN concentrates on digitization tasks faced by the biodiversity community, the software elements being developed are generic in nature, and expected to be applicable to other scientific domains (e.g., exploring the surface of the moon for craters require the same type of crowdsourcing tool as finding words in text, and the same questions of whether machine-learning tools could provide similar results can be tested).<br/><br/>The HuMaIN project proposes to conduct research and develop the following software elements: (a) configurable Machine-Learning applications for scientific data digitization (e.g., Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing), which will be made automatically available as RESTful services for increasing the ability of HuMaIN software elements to interoperate with other elements while decreasing the software development time via a new application specification language; (b) workflows leading to a cyber-human coordination system that will take advantage of feedback loops (e.g., based on consensus of crowdsourced data and its quality) for self-adaptation to changes and increased sustainability of the overall system, (c) new crowdsourcing micro-tasks with ability of being reusable for a variety of scenarios and containing user activity sensors for studying time-effective user interfaces, and (d) services to support automated creation and configuration of crowdsourcing workflows on demand to fit the needs of individual groups. A cloud-based system will be deployed to provide the necessary execution environment with traceability of service executions involved in cyber-human workflows, and cost-effectiveness analysis of all the software elements developed in this project will provide assessment and evaluation of long standing what-if scenarios pertaining human- and machine-intelligent tasks.

Among the many uses of computational chemistry codes are to aid in the design of new materials with specific properties, to understand protein folding dynamics related to the human body, to understand the mechanisms of enzyme catalysis to produce biofuels, and to identify and characterize gaseous species in the atmosphere. Because computational chemistry simulations can require large amounts of computer, memory and disk space, one focus of this research is to reduce the demands on computer resources by exploiting methods that can efficiently fragment large molecules into smaller pieces and at the same time take advantage of computers that have many thousands of computer cores. The principal investigators are developers of several computational chemistry programs, each of which has unique functionalities that have taken multiple person-years to develop and implement. In order to minimize further development efforts and to maximize the utility of the unique features, a second key focus of this research will be to develop the ability of each program to access the unique features and data of the other programs. A major bottleneck in the effort to construct high performance computers with more and more compute cores is the power that is required to drive such systems. One way that the research team will address the power issue is to explore the utility of low power architectures, such as graphical processing units for computational chemistry calculations. All of the newly developed codes will be made available to the user community by web download at no cost.<br/><br/>This project presents an integrated computational science approach to very high quality electronic structure and dynamics calculations that will (a) be broadly accessible to both the development and applications communities, (b) have the capability to address problems of great interest, such as the properties of liquids and solvent effects, and photochemical/photobiological dynamics with high accuracy, (c) provide interoperability and sustainability into the foreseeable future, and (d) solve bottlenecks including power consumption using accelerators. A primary goal is to provide to the broad community new, accurate approaches that may be easily used, with a clear path forward to further code improvement and development. As part of the proposed effort, in addition to the usual outlets of journal articles and public presentations, the investigators will organize workshops at prominent national meetings, so that the expertise and software developed will be available to as broad a group of users as possible. All of the developed codes will be available on the web for easy downloads. The proposed research will develop new paradigms for interoperability, with a focus on the highly popular program suites GAMESS, NWChem, PSI4 and the AIMS dynamics code. Also included will be a cloud-based client-server model, a common quantum chemistry driver and novel data management approaches. The integration of the codes will be accomplished by making use of the combined expertise of the PIs in developing interoperable methods and data interfaces in computational science. In addition, several new methods will be developed, including novel explicit (R12) correlation methods that will be integrated with the most accurate levels of theory: multi-reference and the most accurate and novel coupled cluster methods, as well as the derivation and implementation of analytic derivatives. Applicability to large molecular systems will be made feasible by drawing upon novel fragmentation methods that scale nearly perfectly to the petascale.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450088","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Removing Bottlenecks in High Performance Computational Science"

This project will develop new software and integrate existing software, apps, and data for citizen science - allowing expanded discovery, appraisal, exploration, visualization, analysis, and reuse of software and data. Over the three phases, the software of two platforms, CitSci.org and CyberTracker, will be integrated and new software will be built to integrate and share additional software and data. The project will: (1) broaden the inclusivity, accessibility, and reach of citizen science; (2) elevate the value and rigor of citizen science data; (3) improve interoperability, usability, scalability and sustainability of citizen science software and data; and (4) mobilize data to allow cross-disciplinary research and meta-analyses.

Unfortunately, the impact of HPC is often limited simply because the computers themselves are difficult to use and scientists and engineers would rather spend their time advancing their disciplines than learn HPC. Learning esoteric commands is a hurdle to many students and researchers when they first begin to work with traditional HPC systems, which has contributed to the relatively small proportions of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities within related STEM fields. The Open OnDemand project addresses this problem through innovative software that makes HPC no more difficult than using a desktop computer or a web site, hence reducing that initial learning curve. Open OnDemand will provide an enhanced infrastructure for research and education, in that students and educators will be exposed to the same tools and techniques on smaller departmental and classroom systems that they'll eventually utilize at larger HPC centers. This streamlines the pipeline for developing a more globally competitive STEM workforce that is prepared to dive right into computational problems and resources once they graduate from academia. Open OnDemand also allows scientists and engineers to make specialized domain-specific workflows and expertise available to more collaborators and users, both from academia and industry. This should result in increased partnerships, and the transfer of more technologies from the public to private sectors.<br/><br/>The web has become the dominant access mechanism for remote compute services in every computing area except high-performance computing (HPC). Accessing HPC cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources today, either at the campus or national level, typically requires advanced knowledge of UNIX, familiarity with command-line interfaces and installation and configuration of custom client software. Web applications in HPC today do exist in the form of science gateways. However, gateways have not proliferated in part due to the development and administrative overheads required for each individual gateway. These factors demonstrate an accessibility gap for HPC. Open OnDemand is an open source platform for HPC and remote computing access that addresses the accessibility gap. Open OnDemand will be a public release based on the successful OSC OnDemand platform. OSC OnDemand is a web platform providing Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) users integrated access to HPC systems, web applications, and VNC services. OSC OnDemand has been in production since January 2013, has over 800 distinct users from 27 different NSF fields of science, and its apps have been launched over 70,000 times. In addition to easing access to HPC services, Open OnDemand centralizes web app overheads, easing support for custom visualization and science gateway apps. Open OnDemand has the ability to transform cyberinfrastructure by providing a platform to enable a new delivery method for scientific web tools like HubZero apps, XSEDE Science Gateways, iPython notebooks and workflow tools like Pegasus. <br/><br/>Under this project, the Open OnDemand platform will be created by (a) transitioning the existing OSC OnDemand software to a community developed project hosted on GitHub, (b) extending the per-user web server to serve Rails apps, (c) replacing the custom-developed Proxy with an existing open source project like NGINX and (d) replacing the existing Java-based VNC client with an HTML5 solution. File usage will be improved by updating or replacing AjaXplorer and integrating high performance file transfer functions (sftp and Globus Online). The accessibly apps will be updated by by (a) upgrading or replacing AnyTerm, (b) updating Job Constructor and (c) integrating Open XDMoD and SUPREMM for job and cluster performance metrics. In addition, community infrastructure will be created including (a) system administrator documentation and discussion forums and (b) training materials based on existing OSC OnDemand materials. A beta program will be conducted including (a) assisting beta sites with installs, (b) updating training materials to include new functionality, (c) beginning metric reporting and (d) documenting a Galaxy case study for app integration. HPC center staff will be engaged by through the ""boot camps"" and ""train the trainer"" sessions. Finally, Open OnDemand will be proposed as a project to the XSEDE Campus Bridging Technology Insertion Service. These activities will help meet the following objectives: (1) Transition OSC OnDemand to a community-developed open source software package called Open OnDemand, (2) Improve the interface capabilities of Open OnDemand by updating and expanding the accessibility apps, including integration of Globus Online and Open XDMoD projects. (3) Conduct a program to engage departmental, campus and national HPC users and administrators on enhancing HPC inclusivity through Open OnDemand and (4) Leverage Open OnDemand as a platform to support existing web-based applications such XSEDE Science Gateways and HubZero applications based on our experience supporting a data-intensive biomedical package (the Galaxy Project).",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1534949","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Open OnDemand: Transforming Computational Science through Omnidisciplinary Software Cyberinfrastructure"

""Volunteer computing"" uses these consumer devices, volunteered by their owners, to do scientific computing. In addition to providing additional, much-needed computational resources to scientists, volunteer computing publicizes scientific research and engages citizens in science. BOINC is the primary software system for volunteer computing. It was developed at UC Berkeley with NSF support starting in 2002. Until now, BOINC has been based on a model of independent competing projects. Scientists set up their own BOINC servers, port their applications to run on BOINC, and publicize their projects to attract volunteers. There are about 40 such projects, in many areas of science: examples include Einstein@home, CERN, and SETI@home (astrophysics), Rosetta@home and GPUGrid.net (biomedicine), Climateprediction.net (climate study), and IBM World Community Grid (multiple applications). Together these projects have about 400,000 active volunteers and 12 PetaFLOPS of computing throughput. This model, while successful to an extent, has reached a limit. The number of projects and volunteers has stagnated. Volunteer computing is supplying lots of computing power, but only to a few research projects. For other scientists, there are two major barriers. First, creating a BOINC project has significant overhead: learning a new technology, creating a public web site, generating publicity, and so on. Second, volunteer computing is risky and uncertain; there is no guarantee that a new project will attract volunteers. This project aims to break this barrier, and to make volunteer computing available to all scientists doing high-throughput computing, by replacing the competing-projects model with a new ""central broker"" model. The new model has two related parts: 1) the integration of BOINC with existing high-throughput computing facilities such as supercomputing centers and science portals. Jobs currently run on cluster nodes will be transparently offloaded to volunteer computers. Scientists using these facilities will see faster turnaround times; they'll benefit from volunteer computing without even knowing it's there. 2) The project will change the volunteer interface so that participants sign up for scientific areas and goals rather then for particular projects. For example, a participant might sign up to contribute to cancer research. A central broker, to be developed as part of this project, would dynamically assign their computing resources to projects doing that type of research. This project mobilizes public support for and interest in scientific research by encouraging ""volunteer computing"" and engaging citizens in the conduct of the research itself. It simultaneously advances NSF's mission to advance science while broadening citizen engagement.<br/><br/>The first year of this project will prototype each of these parts, and will integrate BOINC with TACC and nanoHub. Integrating BOINC with existing HTC systems involves several subtasks: 1) Job routing: modifying existing job processing systems used by TACC and nanoHub (Launcher and Rappture respectively) to decide when a group of jobs should be offloaded to BOINC. This decision might involve the estimated runtime of the jobs, input and output file sizes, data sensitivity, the deadline or priority of the jobs, and the identity of the job submitter. 2) Job format conversion: mapping job descriptions (input/output file specifications, resource and timing requirements) to their BOINC equivalents. 3) Application packaging: adapting existing applications (such as nanoHub's simulation tools and TACC's Autodock) to run under BOINC. We will use BOINC's virtual machine facility, which packages an application as a virtual machine image (VirtualBox or Docker) and a program to be run within the VM. This allows existing Linux applications to run on consumer desktop platforms such as Windows and Mac, as well as providing a strong security sandbox and an efficient application-independent checkpoint/restart mechanism. 4) File handling: moving input and output files between existing storage systems (typically inaccessible from outside firewalls) to Internet-visible servers. This will use existing BOINC components that manage files based on hashes to eliminate duplicate transfer and storage of files. 5) Job monitoring and control: adapting existing web- or command-line based tools for monitoring the progress of batches of jobs, and for aborting jobs, to work with BOINC. This will use existing Web RPCs provided by BOINC for these purposes. This project will carry out these tasks by designing and implementing new software as needed, testing for correctness, performance, and scalability, and deploying it in a production environment. The second part of the project - a brokering system for allocating computing power based on volunteer scientific preferences - will be designed and prototyped. This involves several subtasks: 1) Designing a schema for volunteer preferences, including scientific areas and sub-areas, project nationality and institutions, specific projects and applications, inclusions/exclusions, and so on. 2) Designing a schema for assigning attributes to job streams (e.g. their area, sub-area, institution, etc.), and for assigning quotas or priorities to job streams. 3) Designing a relational database for storing the above information. 4) Designing and implementing policies for assigning volunteer resources to job streams in a way that respects volunteer preferences and optimizes quota, fairness, and throughput criteria. This will be implemented as a BOINC ""account manager"" so that volunteers see a single interface rather than lots of separate projects and web sites.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550526","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Adding Volunteer Computing to the Research Cyberinfrastructure"

This is particularly true when molecules meet solid surfaces - due to the particular challenges of experiments in such a setting. Yet the molecule-on-surface frontier encompasses a vast class of problems of tremendous practical importance: industrial applications facilitated by surface processes are estimated to produce globally more than than 15 trillion USD worth of goods and products. This research will improve our ability to simulate the physics and chemistry of molecules on surfaces by extending the advanced simulation methodologies that were originally developed by for modeling electrons in molecules. This project will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the surface science but also open a road to technological applications relevant to producing and storing clean energy and in designing improved catalysts. The research may result in a new computer software framework for simulating electrons in molecules and materials. This software will be a unique contribution to the U.S. cyberinfrastructure and spur further innovation by other researchers in the US and worldwide, who will be able to access its source code for free. The software framework will also serve as an education platform for training computational chemists and materials scientists.<br/><br/>A frontier simulation challenge lies at the intersection of the two domains of chemistry and materials science - namely to determine, with predictive accuracy, the properties and chemistry of molecules on solid surfaces. The molecule-on-surface frontier encompasses a vast class of problems of tremendous practical importance: heterogeneous catalysis, photovoltaics, and emerging electronic materials. Yet, from a simulation perspective, it is not currently possible to efficiently combine the recent advances in highly accurate many-body molecular and periodic condensed phase methodologies in these problems, due to a significant gap between how the electronic structure theories of molecules and materials are formulated, as reflected in distinct algorithms and disjoint codebases. The goal of this project is to reduce and/or completely eliminate the gap between molecular and solid-state electronic structure methodologies, in theory, algorithms, and in usable community software implementations. This will be achieved by building an ambitious Electronic structure for Molecules and Solids (EMOS) software framework that will permit accurate computation of the first-principles electronic structure of both molecules and solids on an equivalent footing - and with the high efficiency necessary for high-throughput screening or ab initio molecular dynamics. These efforts build on the leading track-record of the principal investigators in developing open-source quantum chemistry software as well as automated computer implementation and high-performance parallel libraries. The project will allow the advances from molecular electronic structure - embedding, reduced-scaling many-body methodology, accurate excited-state electronic structure, and others - to be applied routinely to molecules, materials, and combinations of the two as relevant to surface chemistry. This has great potential to advance the state-of-the-art in treatment of electronic structure and open new lines of theoretical inquiry. The resulting open-source production-quality toolkit will be validated against experimental data for a host of surface phenomena, from exciton dynamics to surface spectroscopy and catalysis. An open-source US-based advanced materials code is a long-standing omission in U.S. cyberinfrastructure. As a high-performance framework for simulation of electronic structure of molecules, solids, and their interfaces with unprecedented accuracy, EMOS will be a significant contribution to this effort. Further, the modular component based structure will be able to be integrated with other major electronic structure packages through the reuse of the modules. This project will provide invaluable training opportunities to the students and postdocs who will develop the software framework under the direct supervision of principal investigators. In addition, each project site will contribute to the development of a stakeholder network for EMOS by hosting, each summer, visiting students and faculty representing the broader theoretical community, to train them on the use of EMOS in research and education. The project team will also use EMOS in teaching classes and summer schools, building on already established efforts in this area; these efforts will also be extended to an online setting.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550471","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Software Framework for Electronic Structure of Molecules and Solids"

This project creates a open source software infrastructure by solving many problems common to different types of analysis programs. By using this infrastructure, researchers can focus on scientific discovery, not writing computer programs. This project can improve efficiency and thus reduce the cost for running programs analyzing large amounts of data. This infrastructure promotes education because students can obtain an instantaneous view of the network cameras and use the visual information to understand the world.

Math libraries have historically been in the vanguard of software that must be quickly adapted to such design revolutions because they are the common, low-level software workhorses that do all the most basic mathematical calculations for many different types of applications. The Sustained Innovation for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS) project updates two of the most widely used numerical libraries in the history of Computational Science and Engineering---LAPACK and ScaLAPACK, (abbreviated Sca/LAPACK)---enhancing and hardening them for this ongoing revolution in processor architecture and system design. SILAS creates a layered package of software components, capable of running at every level of the platform deployment pyramid, from the desktop to the largest supercomputers in the world. It achieves three complementary objectives: 1) Wherever possible, SILAS delivers seamless access to the most up-to-date algorithms, numerical implementations, and performance, by way of Sca/LAPACK programming interfaces that are familiar to many computational scientists; 2) Wherever necessary, SILAS makes advanced algorithms, numerical implementations and performance capabilities available through new interface extensions; and 3) SILAS provides a well engineered conduit through which new discoveries at the frontiers of research in these areas can be channeled as quickly as possible to all the application communities that depend on high performance linear algebra. The improvements and innovations included in SILAS derive from a variety of sources. They represent the results (including designs and well tested prototypes) of the PIs' own algorithmic and software research agenda, which has targeted multicore, hybrid and extreme scale system architectures. They are an outcome of extensive and on-going interactions with users, vendors, and the management of large NSF and DOE supercomputing facilities. They flow from cross-disciplinary engagement with other areas of computer science and engineering, anticipating the demands and opportunities of new architectures and programming models. And finally, they come from the enthusiastic participation of the research community in developing and offering enhanced versions of existing Sca/LAPACK codes.<br/><br/>The primary impact of SILAS is a direct function of the importance of the Sca/LAPACK libraries to many branches of computational science. The Sca/LAPACK libraries are the community standard for dense linear algebra and have been adopted and/or supported by a large community of users, computing centers, and HPC vendors. Learning to use them is a basic part of the education of a computational scientist or engineer in many fields and at many academic institutions. Application domains where Sca/LAPACK have historically been heavily used include (among a host of other examples) airplane wing design, radar cross-section studies, flow around ships and other off-shore constructions, diffusion of solid bodies in a liquid, noise reduction, and diffusion of light through small particles. Moreover, the list of application partners working with SILAS to enhance and transform these libraries for next generation platforms expands this traditional list to include quantum chemistry, adaptive mesh refinement schemes, computational materials science, geophysical flows, stochastic simulation and database research for ""big data"". No other numerical library can claim this breadth of integration with the community. Thus, there is every reason to believe that enhancing these libraries with state of the art methods and algorithms and adapting them for new and emerging platforms (reaching up to extreme scale), will have a correspondingly large impact on the research and education community, government laboratories, and private industry.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339797","fuchsia_tree","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Sustained Innovation for Linear Algebra Software (SILAS)"

First, researchers increasingly rely on computation to process ever larger data sets and to perform ever more computationally-intensive simulations. Second, individual processor speeds are no longer increasing with every computer chip generation as they once were. To compensate, processor manufacturers have moved to including more processors, or cores, on a chip with each generation. To obtain peak performance on these multicore chips, software must be implemented so that it can execute in parallel and thereby use the additional processor cores. Unfortunately, writing efficient, explicitly parallel software programs using today's software-development tools takes advanced training in computer science, and even with such training, the task remains extremely difficult, error-prone, and time consuming. This project will create a new high-level programming platform, called Implicit Parallel Programming (IPP), designed to bring the performance promises of modern multicore machines to scientists and engineers without the costs associated with having to teach these users how to write explicitly parallel programs. In the short term, this research will provide direct and immediate benefit to researchers in several areas of science as the PIs will pair computer science graduate students with non-computer science graduate students to study, analyze, and develop high-value scientific applications. In the long term, this research has the potential to fundamentally change the way scientists obtain performance from parallel machines, improve their productivity, and accelerate the overall pace of science. This work will also have major educational impact by developing courseware and tutorial materials, useable by all scientists and engineers, on the topics of explicit and implicit parallel computing.<br/><br/>IPP will operate by allowing users to write ordinary sequential programs and then to augment them with logical specifications that expand (or abstract) the set of sequential program behaviors. This capacity for abstraction will provide parallelizing compilers with the flexibility to more aggressively optimize programs than would otherwise be possible. In fact, it will enable effective parallelization techniques where they were impossible before. The language design and compiler implementation will be accompanied by formal semantic analysis that will be used to judge the correctness of compiler transformations, provide a foundation for about reasoning programs, and guide the creation of static analysis and program defect detection algorithms. Moreover since existing programs and languages can be viewed as (degenerately) implicitly parallel, decades of investment in human expertise, languages, compilers, methods, tools, and applications is preserved. In particular, it will be possible to upgrade old legacy programs or libraries from slow sequential versions without overhauling the entire system architecture, but merely by adding a few auxiliary specifications. Compiler technology will help guide scientists and engineers through this process, further simplifying the task. Conceptually, IPP restores an important layer of abstraction, freeing programmers to write high-level code, designed to be easy to understand, rather than low-level code, architected according to the specific demands of a particular parallel machine.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1047879","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Accelerating the Pace of Research through Implicitly Parallel Programming"

However, the computing potential of HEC machines is delivered only through productive parallel program development and efficient parallel execution. This project enables application developers to improve performance on future HEC machines for their scientific and engineering processes. This project challenges the current model for parallel application development via ""black box"" tools and services. Instead, the project offers an open, transparent software infrastructure -- a Glass Box system -- for creating and tuning large-scale, parallel applications. `Opening up' the tools and services used to create and evaluate peta- and exa-scale codes involves developing interfaces and methods that make tool-internal information and available for new performance management services that improve developer productivity and code efficiency.<br/><br/>The project will explore the information that can be shared 'across the software stack'. Methods will be developed for analyzing program information, performance data and tool knowledge. The resulting Glass Box system will allow developers to better assess the performance of their parallel codes. Tool creators can use the performance data to create new analysis and optimization techniques. System developers can also better manage multicore and machine resources at runtime, using JIT compilation and binary code editing to exploit the evolving hardware. Working with the `Keeneland' NSF Track II machine and our industry partners, the project will create new performance monitoring tools, compiler methods and system-level resource management techniques.

In materials science, they enable the computational (""in silico"") design of new materials with improved properties. In biological or pharmacological research, they provide molecular-level insights into the function of macromolecules or drugs. In the search for new energy solutions, they give molecular-level insights into new solar cell designs, catalytic processes, and many others. A key bottleneck in many applications and calculations is the ""cubic scaling wall"" of the so-called Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem with system size (i.e., the effort increases by a factor of 1,000 if the model size increases by a factor of 10). This project will establish an open source software infrastructure ""ELSI"" that offers a common, practical interface to initially three complementary solution strategies to alleviate or overcome the difficulty associated with solving the Kohn-Sham eigenvalue problem. ELSI will enable a broad range of end user communities, centered around different codes with, often, unique features that tie a specialized group of scientists to that particular solution, to easily incorporate state-of-the-art solution strategies for a key problem they all share. By providing these effective, accessible solution strategies, we will open up major areas for electronic structure theory where DFT based predictive methodologies are not applicable today. This will in turn open doors for new development in materials science, chemistry, and all related areas. Commitments to support ELSI exist from some of the most important electronic structure developer communities, as well as from industry and government leaders in high-performance computing. Thus, we will create a strong U.S. based infrastructure that leverages the large user and developer base from a globally active community developing DFT methods for materials research.<br/><br/>ELSI will support and enhance three state-of-the-art approaches, each best suited for a specific problem range: (i) The ELPA (EigensoLvers for Petascale Applications) library, a leading library for efficient, massively parallel solution of eigenvalue problems (for small- and mid-sized problems up to several 1,000s of atoms), (ii) the OMM (Orbital Minimization Method) in a recent re-implementation, which circumvents the eigenvalue problem by focusing on a reduced, auxiliary problem (for systems in the several 1,000s of atoms range), and (iii) the PEXSI (Pole EXpansion and Selective Inversion) library, a proven reduced scaling (at most quadratic scaling) solution for general systems (for problems with 1,000s of atoms and beyond). By establishing standardized interfaces in a style already familiar to many electronic structure developers, ELSI will enable production electronic structure codes that use it to significantly reduce the ""scaling wall"" of the eigenvalue problem. First, ELSI will help them make efficient use of the most powerful computational platforms available. The target platforms are current massively parallel computers and multicore architectures, GPU based systems and future manycore processors. Second, the project will make targeted methodological improvements to ELPA, OMM, and PEXSI, e.g., a more effective use of matrix sparsity towards very large systems.

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means.

The IB method was introduced to describe the fluid dynamics of heart valves, but this methodology has also been applied to a wide range of problems in biological and non-biological fluid dynamics. The IB method typically requires high spatial resolution to resolve the viscous boundary layers at fluid-structure interfaces and, at higher Reynolds numbers, to resolve vortices shed from such interfaces. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the principal investigator has developed an adaptive version of the IB method that employs block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where it is needed. IBAMR software is a distributed-memory parallel implementation of this adaptive scheme. The key goal of this project is to make IBAMR the unifying software framework for users of the IB method, thereby establishing a community of researchers who employ a common software infrastructure for biofluids model development and simulation. The project aims to enhance IBAMR substantially by (1) developing and implementing implicit IB schemes that will allow for the efficient use of large numerical timesteps; (2) developing and implementing extensions of the basic IB methodology, including a new variable-viscosity version of the IB method, and an existing stochastic version for microscale and nanoscale problems in which Brownian motion is important; (3) optimizing IBAMR for use with modern as well as projected-future high performance computing systems comprised of multi-core compute nodes interconnected by a high-speed network; and (4) developing front-end tools for model construction, validation, and execution, thereby facilitating the adoption and use of IBAMR, especially by students and researchers with limited computational experience.<br/><br/>From the writhing and coiling of DNA, to the beating and pumping motions of cilia and flagella, to the flow of blood in the heart and throughout the circulation, coupled fluid-structure systems are ubiquitous in biology and physiology.

IBAMR is a framework for performing computer simulations of biological fluid mechanics, and this project seeks to establish IBAMR as a unifying software infrastructure that will serve as a common ""language"" for developing and exchanging such models. IBAMR is already being actively used within several independent research projects that aim to model different aspects of cardiovascular dynamics, such as platelet aggregation and the fluid dynamics of natural and prosthetic heart valves. Such simulations promise ultimately to improve the efficacy of devices and procedures for treating cardiovascular disease. This software also is being used within projects that study other problems in biofluid mechanics, including insect flight, aquatic locomotion, and the dynamics of phytoplankton. By enhancing IBAMR, this project will also enhance significantly the ability of these and other research groups to construct detailed biofluids models without requiring those researchers to develop the significant software infrastructure needed to perform such simulations. This project will enhance the IBAMR software substantially, extending the range of problems to which it may be applied, and improving the methods implemented within the software as well as the efficiency of the implementation. The work of this project will extend greatly the community of students and researchers who are able to use IBAMR to model biological fluid-structure interaction, in part by implementing graphical software tools for building IB models and running IB simulations.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1047734","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Parallel and Adaptive Simulation Infrastructure for Biological Fluid-Structure Interaction"

Modeling of sources of gravitational radiation is more than ever a critical necessity in order to interpret the observations. The project Einstein Toolkit has as overarching mission to provide the scientific community with a sustainable software platform of core computational tools for research focused on astrophysical systems endowed with complex multi-scale/multi-physics properties which are governed by Einstein's equations of General Relativity. The central premise of the project Einstein Toolkit is to create a broad and vibrant community of users, a community where interdisciplinary collaborations are the norm and not the exception, a community driving advances in the next generation of high-performance computing cyberinfrastructure. The main objectives of the project Einstein Toolkit are: developing software tools for a radical increase in scientific productivity, achieving sustainability of the software ecosystem, addressing software engineering challenges, and the curation of data from general relativistic numerical simulations. <br/><br/>This project will achieve its goals through two major activity areas. Regarding the software ecosystem and its sustainability, the scheduler that handles the flow of tasks in a problem will be redesigned to be more versatile and to improve its performance. In addition new software modules will be developed to broaden the choices of initial data and matter sources, as well as modules for problems requiring a high degree of experimentation with equations and numerical methodologies. A new general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code will also be integrated in the Einstein Toolkit. The second activity area involves building a simulation data repository. The repository will allows user to compare results, contribute data, test innovative ideas and algorithms for gravitational wave data analysis, and to explore or discover new phenomena in sources of gravitational radiation. The broader impact effort in the project Einstein Toolkit will be organized in two major activity areas. The first involves community integration. The project will support a program of ease-of-use on-line tutorials and a workshops/tutorial series. The program will help small groups or individual investigators familiarizing with the codes and modules in the toolkit as well as pathways to become a developer. Regarding outreach and education, the project Einstein Toolkit will enable interdisciplinary training of students and postdocs in numerical relativity, computational astrophysics and computer science. The effort will includes developing a teaching resources bank for educational activities involving computational topics applied to gravitational physics and astrophysics. The educational resources will be suitable for computational courses in general relativity and astrophysics at both the graduate and undergraduate level.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Physics Division in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550514","fuchsia_tree","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Einstein Toolkit Community Integration and Data Exploration"

As the universe expanded, this plasma cooled and condensed into the building blocks of ordinary matter around us: protons, neutrons, and atomic nuclei. Droplets of this fluid, which exists only at temperatures above 2 trillion Kelvin, are generated and studied in the laboratory today using collisions of high-energy heavy ions at Brookhaven National Laboratory and CERN. A key method to study the Quark-Gluon Plasma is the generation of high-energy quarks and gluons in the collision, which interact with the hot plasma and emerge as ""jets"" of particles that are measured by experiments. These jets provide powerful tools to study the internal structure of the plasma, analogous to tomography in medical imaging. However, interpretation of jet measurements requires sophisticated numerical modeling and simulation, and comparison of theory calculations with experimental data demands advanced statistical tools. The JETSCAPE Collaboration, an interdisciplinary team of physicists, computer scientists, and statisticians, will develop a comprehensive software framework that will provide a systematic, rigorous approach to meet this challenge. Training programs, workshops, summer schools and MOOCs, will disseminate the expertise needed to modify and maintain this framework.<br/><br/>The JETSCAPE Collaboration will develop a scalable and portable open source software package to replace a variety of existing codes. The modular integrated software framework will consist of interacting generators to simulate (i) wave functions of the incoming nuclei, (ii) viscous fluid dynamical evolution of the hot plasma, and (iii) transport and modification of jets in the plasma. Integrated advanced statistical analysis tools will provide non-expert users with quantitative methods to validate novel theoretical descriptions of jet modification, by comparison with the complete set of current experimental data. To improve the efficiency of this computationally intensive task, the collaboration will develop trainable emulators that can accurately predict experimental observables by interpolation between full model runs, and employ accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for both the fluid dynamical simulations and the modification of jets. The collaboration will create this framework with a user-friendly envelope that allows for continuous modifications, updates and improvements of each of its components. The effort will serve as a template for other fields that involve complex dynamical modeling and comparison with large data sets. It will open a new era for high-precision extraction of the internal structure of the Quark-Gluon Plasma with quantifiable uncertainties. <br/><br/>This project advances the objectives of the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI), an effort aimed at sustaining and enhancing the U.S. scientific, technological, and economic leadership position in High-Performance Computing (HPC) research, development, and deployment. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Physics Division and the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550223","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Jet Energy-Loss Tomography with a Statistically and Computationally Advanced Program Envelope (JETSCAPE)"

These data are increasing in size and are becoming much more complex; in many cases, they can be considered structured. An example of structured data is data describing disease propagation in a specific population. Widespread sharing of data can, among many other things, help corporations increase their revenues, help reduce the spread of communicable diseases, accelerate the cure of some of the most significant diseases, and enable reproducible experiments amongst researchers. Although there is little disagreement that sharing data has tremendous benefits, it is still not as widespread as it should be. This is, in part, due to privacy concerns with sharing datasets. This project will develop an open source system (ShareSafe) that allows data owners to evaluate the security (such as resistance to de-anonymization attacks) and utility of their anonymized datasets before release, which will help facilitate the data sharing process.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to develop a software framework, ShareSafe, that (1) helps structured data owners (e.g., social network researchers, epidemiologists) evaluate the security (against modern de-anonymization attacks) and utility of their datasets when using simple and state-of-the-art anonymization techniques; and (2) to provide structured data security/privacy researchers a uniform platform to comprehensively study, evaluate, and compare existing/newly developed techniques for structured data utility and privacy. ShareSafe is a comprehensive, user-friendly framework with the following capabilities: ShareSafe will enable data owners to: (1) anonymize their datasets with all of the state-of-the art anonymization techniques; (2) measure the utility of anonymized datasets using state-of-the-art utility measurement techniques; (3) evaluate the practical security of their datasets by subjecting them to state-of-the-art de-anonymization attacks; and (4) evaluate the theoretical security of their datasets by subjecting them to state-of-the-art de-anonymization quantification (de-anonymizability analysis) techniques. Understanding the results from (2)-(4) allows data owners to determine which anonymization algorithm suits their needs when sharing datasets.

(p. 122)<br/><br/>Over the last few years, the design of computer and software systems, particularly as they relate to simulation in the physical sciences, has been organized around a collection of algorithmic patterns / motifs. These patterns have been very productive because they are a natural ""common language"" in which application scientists can express their computations, and for which computer scientists can provide optimized libraries, domain specific languages, compilers, and other software tools.<br/><br/>This project will design an institute focused on a subset of these patterns --- structured grid discretizations of partial differential equations and particle methods, along with the linear and nonlinear solvers that enable their effective use --- with the specific goals of providing simulation capabilities for a set of scientific domains that make heavy use of these patterns. Two major components are envisioned to this proposed institute, called the Institute for High-Performance Computational Science with Structured Meshes and Particles (HPCS-SMP). The first component is a software infrastructure development activity that will be performed by a team whose expertise spans the design and development of mathematical algorithms and software frameworks, as well as the design and development of compilers, runtime systems, and tools that enable one to obtain high performance from emerging multicore and heterogeneous architectures. The second component is an outreach activity, in which algorithms, libraries, and software frameworks developed by the institute will be customized and integrated into simulation codes for stakeholder application domains. At the heart of this activity will be collaborations and partnerships, in which the institute will provide one or more software developers to collaborate with application scientists over a period of months to years to develop a new simulation capability or enhance an existing one.<br/><br/>The design of this institute will be carried out through a series of workshops, each focused on one of five stakeholder science domains that have been identified as using these motifs and that play a central role in various NSF Grand Challenge problems, with participation of both representatives of the science domain and the the relevant mathematics and computer science communities. In addition, there will be a final workshop that will bring together the relevant mathematics and computer science experts to identify cross-cutting themes. These information obtained from these workshops will be used by the project to develop the final conceptual design of the institute, in the form of a document that includes the input from all of the workshops and our analysis of how this leads to a design of a software institute.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1216890","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-S2I2: High-Performance Computational Science with Structured Meshes and Particles (HPCS-SMP)"

There is a long tradition of software packages for algebraic combinatorics. These have been crucial in the development of combinatorics since the 1960s. The originality of the Sage-Combinat project lies in successfully addressing the following simultaneous objectives. It offers a wide variety of interoperable and extensible tools, integrated in a general purpose mathematical software package, as needed for daily computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics; it is developed by a community of researchers spread around the world and across institutions; and it is open source and depends only on open source software.

Hivert and Thi�ery (Paris-Sud, Orsay), founders and lead developers of Sage-Combinat, are both strongly affiliated with this project. Some of the research areas addressed in this project include symmetric functions, in particular Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary Cartan types and their nonsymmetric analogues, crystals, rigged configurations and combinatorial R-matrices, affine Weyl groups and Hecke algebras, cluster algebras, and posets.<br/><br/>The project will develop Sage-Combinat in areas relevant to the ongoing research of the participants, together with relevant underlying infrastructure. The project will include three Sage Days workshops, and will be affiliated with a third scheduled workshop at ICERM. These workshops include a strong outreach component and have been a potent tool for connecting researchers and recruiting Sage users and developers. The grant will also fund a dedicated software development and computation server for Sage-Combinat, to be hosted in the Sage computation farm in Seattle. Emphasis will be placed on the development of thematic tutorials that will make the code accessible to new users.

These compute engines, coupled with tighter integration of faster interconnection fabrics, are drivers for the next-generation high end computing (HEC) machines. However, the computing potential of HEC machines is delivered only through productive parallel program development and efficient parallel execution. This project enables application developers to improve performance on future HEC machines for their scientific and engineering processes. This project challenges the current model for parallel application development via ""black box"" tools and services. Instead, the project offers an open, transparent software infrastructure -- a Glass Box system -- for creating and tuning large-scale, parallel applications. `Opening up' the tools and services used to create and evaluate peta- and exa-scale codes involves developing interfaces and methods that make tool-internal information and available for new performance management services that improve developer productivity and code efficiency.<br/><br/>The project will explore the information that can be shared 'across the software stack'. Methods will be developed for analyzing program information, performance data and tool knowledge. The resulting Glass Box system will allow developers to better assess the performance of their parallel codes. Tool creators can use the performance data to create new analysis and optimization techniques. System developers can also better manage multicore and machine resources at runtime, using JIT compilation and binary code editing to exploit the evolving hardware. Working with the `Keeneland' NSF Track II machine and our industry partners, the project will create new performance monitoring tools, compiler methods and system-level resource management techniques. The effort is driven by the large-scale codes running on today's petascale machines. Its broader impact is derived from the interactions with technology developers and application scientists as well as from its base in three universities with diverse student populations.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148310","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: A Glass Box Approach to Enabling Open, Deep Interactions in the HPC Toolchain"

The project Einstein Toolkit has as overarching mission to provide the scientific community with a sustainable software platform of core computational tools for research focused on astrophysical systems endowed with complex multi-scale/multi-physics properties which are governed by Einstein's equations of General Relativity. The central premise of the project Einstein Toolkit is to create a broad and vibrant community of users, a community where interdisciplinary collaborations are the norm and not the exception, a community driving advances in the next generation of high-performance computing cyberinfrastructure. The main objectives of the project Einstein Toolkit are: developing software tools for a radical increase in scientific productivity, achieving sustainability of the software ecosystem, addressing software engineering challenges, and the curation of data from general relativistic numerical simulations. <br/><br/>This project will achieve its goals through two major activity areas. Regarding the software ecosystem and its sustainability, the scheduler that handles the flow of tasks in a problem will be redesigned to be more versatile and to improve its performance. In addition new software modules will be developed to broaden the choices of initial data and matter sources, as well as modules for problems requiring a high degree of experimentation with equations and numerical methodologies. A new general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics code will also be integrated in the Einstein Toolkit. The second activity area involves building a simulation data repository. The repository will allows user to compare results, contribute data, test innovative ideas and algorithms for gravitational wave data analysis, and to explore or discover new phenomena in sources of gravitational radiation. The broader impact effort in the project Einstein Toolkit will be organized in two major activity areas. The first involves community integration. The project will support a program of ease-of-use on-line tutorials and a workshops/tutorial series. The program will help small groups or individual investigators familiarizing with the codes and modules in the toolkit as well as pathways to become a developer. Regarding outreach and education, the project Einstein Toolkit will enable interdisciplinary training of students and postdocs in numerical relativity, computational astrophysics and computer science. The effort will includes developing a teaching resources bank for educational activities involving computational topics applied to gravitational physics and astrophysics. The educational resources will be suitable for computational courses in general relativity and astrophysics at both the graduate and undergraduate level.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Division of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering and the Physics Division in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1550551","fuchsia_tree","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Research: Einstein Toolkit Community Integration and Data Exploration"

Unfortunately, this has resulted in a situation where the generated scientific results do not often agree across CPUs and GPUs. This exacerbates the danger of drawing wrong conclusions in crucial areas such as physics, weather simulations, drug discovery, and engineering computations. This project offers a combination of existing and new techniques in dissecting scientific experiments conducted through simulations, obtaining believable results, finding the root causes of varying results, and developing best practices to ensure higher result fidelity. Its techniques have special emphasis on GPUs, given their often poorly specified and evolving nature.<br/><br/>Result variability has many causes, including evolving, incorrect, or ambiguous specifications of computer hardware and software, racing data accesses, varying floating point precision standards, and incorrect result association within compound computational steps. This project develops methods that help a scientist systematically search through and eliminate these causes, thus accelerating the process of debugging result variability. The produced tools and exemplars of known erroneous behaviors allow a scientist to avoid the use of incorrect specifications, isolate and eliminate data races, and isolate and eliminate unreliable numerical steps.

In the foreseeable future, GIS software will continue to play essential roles for breaking through scientific challenges in numerous fields and improving decision-making practices with broad societal impacts. However, fulfilling such roles is increasingly dependent on the ability to handle very large spatiotemporal data sets and complex analysis software based on synthesizing computational and spatial thinking enabled by cyberinfrastructure, which conventional GIS-based software approaches do not provide. This project will establish CyberGIS as a fundamentally new software framework comprising a seamless integration of cyberinfrastructure, GIS, and spatial analysis/modeling capabilities. Specifically, the project will: 1) engage a multidisciplinary community through a participatory approach in evolving CyberGIS software requirements; 2) integrate and sustain a core set of composable, interoperable, manageable, and reusable CyberGIS software elements based on community-driven and open source strategies; 3) empower high-performance and scalable CyberGIS by exploiting spatial characteristics of data and analytical operations for achieving unprecedented capabilities for geospatial knowledge discovery; 4) enhance an online geospatial problem solving environment to allow for the contribution, sharing, and learning of CyberGIS software by numerous users, which fosters the development of education, outreach, and training programs crosscutting multiple disciplines; 5) deploy and test CyberGIS software by linking with national and international cyberinfrastructure to achieve scalability to significant sizes of geospatial problems, cyberinfrastructure resources, and user communities; and 6) evaluate and improve the CyberGIS framework through domain science applications and vibrant partnerships to gain better understanding of the complexity of coupled human-natural systems.<br/><br/>The CyberGIS software framework will shift the current paradigm of GIS and associated spatial analysis/modeling software to create scalable and sustainable software ecosystems while achieving groundbreaking scientific advances in understanding coupled human-natural systems that would be impossible otherwise. These advances will, for example, dramatically advance the understanding of disaster preparedness and response and impacts of global climate change.

A particularly important class of data arises from multi-epoch wide-field surveys, which are essentially 'movies' of the sky. These advances in time domain astronomy are crucial for such diverse and important research topics as exoplanet discovery, supernovae and other transients, variable stars, and accretion phenomena. However, most astronomers use only a narrow range of classical statistical methods for interpreting these large datasets. This problem can now be alleviated with the R statistical computing environment and its rapidly growing CRAN add-on packages. This project will bring the R software capabilities into the astronomical research community and introduce specialized astrostatistical methodology into R.<br/><br/>In particular, the research includes two complementary projects. First, CRAN packages will be developed for the analysis of time domain data with irregularly spaced observation times. This is a difficulty rarely encountered in other fields but common in multi-epoch astronomical studies, due to diurnal cycles, satellite orbits, survey cadence patterns, and telescope allocation limitations. Astronomers have developed a wide range of treatments for such problems, but most have not been evaluated statistically or incorporated into widely-used software packages, so a part of this study will be a statistical evaluation of competing methods. Second, the prototype VOStat Web service will be developed into a major tool and integrated into the growing Virtual Astronomical Observatory (VAO) software environment. VOStat will provide dozens of functionalities in many areas of applied statistics: data manipulation and visualization, nonparametric statistics and density estimation, probability density functions, regression and inference, multivariate analysis, clustering and classification, censoring and truncation, time series analysis, spatial point processes and image processing. These achievements will improve the statistical sophistication within the VAO and for thousands of other astronomical studies.<br/><br/>These software developments will improve the statistical analysis of a large number of astronomical research studies every year. Coding within R has the simultaneous advantage of inheriting the large infrastructure of methodology and graphics, itself of enormous value to the entire astronomical community. While the production of CRAN packages directly allows wide dissemination of the code, integrating the code into the VAO software environment through VOStat will make it conveniently accessible to all astronomers. A strong pedagogical component will further encourage less experienced astronomers to learn and use more advanced statistical methods. In addition, the CRAN packages on astrostatistical methods for irregular time series may have value to statisticians, physicists and economists who also might encounter datasets of this type.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1047586","chartreuse_atom","SI2-SSE: Statistical software for astronomical surveys"

The research program of this collaborative software institute aims to create an open and effective scientific software package that can make efficient use of cutting-edge high performance computers (HPC) to solve challenging problems involving the physics and chemistry of materials. By having such software available, this software initiative will have multiple broad impacts. First, the community of materials scientists will be able to study next-generation problems in materials physics and chemistry, and computer science advances that enable the software will be demonstrated and made accessible for both communities which will help cross-fertilize further such collaborative efforts. Second, the capability of simulating and engineering more complex materials systems and technological devices could play a role in helping the US continue is competitive edge in science, technology, and education. Third, through training of young scientists, direct outreach to the broader scientific community through workshops and conferences, and educational programs ranging from secondary to graduate levels, the power, importance, and capabilities of computational modeling, materials science, and computer science methodologies that enable the science will be communicated to a broad audience.

This award will deliver a set of open source petascale quantum simulation tools in the broad areas of materials design, nano science and nanotechnology. Materials prediction and design are key aspects to the recently created Materials Genome initiative, which seeks to ""deploy advanced materials at least twice as fast, at a fraction of the cost."" Computational materials design is the critical aspect of that initiative, which relies on computation guiding experiments. The outcomes of the latter will in turn lead to follow-up computation in an iterative feedback loop. Nanoscience, which studies properties of materials and processes on fundamental scale of nanometers, promises development of materials and systems with radically new properties. However, the nanoscale properties are hard to measure and even harder to predict theoretically. Only simulations that can fully account for the complexity and variability at that fundamental scale stand a chance of predicting and utilizing the macroscopic properties that emerge. This truly requires petascale resources and efficient petascale software tools.<br/><br/>This award will develop software tools build on the real-space multigrid (RMG) software suite and distribute them to the national user community. The RMG code already scales to 128,000 CPU cores and 18,000 GPU nodes. The award will further enhance RMG through development of new iterative methods with improved convergence, optimization of additional modules for existing and new petascale computing platforms, and creation of ease-to-use interfaces to the main codes. Workshops in RMG usage will be conducted at XSEDE workshops and other meetings of NSF supercomputing centers. RMG will be distributed through a web portal, which will also contain user forums and video tutorials, recorded at live user sessions. A library of representative examples for the main petascale platforms will be maintained. RMG will enable quantum simulations of unprecedented size, enabling studies of the building blocks of functional nano or bio-nano structures, which often involve thousands of atoms and must be described with the requisite fidelity. The development of petascale quantum simulation software and its user community will lead to cross-fertilization of ideas both within and across fields.

This field relies upon the existence of sophisticated software packages that enable researchers to conduct these simulations. There are two general approaches for simulating bulk materials: molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo, each of which is appropriate for certain problems.

The Critical Zone is Earth's permeable near-surface layer - from the atmosphere at the vegetation's canopy to the lower boundary of actively circulating groundwaters. The Critical Zone was a term coined by the National Research Council's Basic Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences (BROES) Report (2001) to highlight the imperative for a new approach to thoroughly multi-disciplinary research on the zone of the Earth?s surface that is critical to sustaining terrestrial life on our planet. In January 2013, 103 members of the CZ community met for the CZ-EarthCube Domain Workshop (NSF Award #1252238) to prioritize the CZ community's key science drivers, key computational and information technology (""cyber"") challenges and key cyber needs. They identified that the central scientific challenge of the critical zone science community is to develop a ""grand unifying theory"" of the critical zone through a theory-model-data fusion approach. Work participants unanimously described that the key missing need of this approach was a future cyberinfrastructure for seamless 4D visual exploration of the integrated knowledge (data, model outputs and interpolations) from all the bio and geoscience disciplines relevant to critical zone structure and function, similar to today?s ability to easily explore historical satellite imagery and photographs of the earth's surface using Google Earth.

The entire BiG CZ Software system will be developed on public repositories as a modular suite of fully open source software projects.

However, the rapid evolution at the hardware level over the last few years have been unmatched by corresponding changes at the programming paradigm level. According to the consensus of several major studies, the degree of parallelism on large systems is expected to increase by several orders of magnitude. As a result, the Message Passing Interface (MPI), which has been the de-facto standard message passing paradigm, lacks an efficient and portable way of handling today's architectures. To efficiently handle such systems, MPI implementations must adopt more asynchronous and thread-friendly behaviors to perform better than they do on today?s systems. Maintaining and further enhancing MPI, one of the most widely-used communication libraries in high-performance computing, will have a far-reaching impact beyond the scientific community, and represents a critical building block for continued advances in all areas of science and engineering.<br/>The ADAPT project enhances, hardens and modernizes the Open MPI library in the context of this ongoing revolution in processor architecture and system design. It creates a viable foundation for a new generation of Open MPI components, enabling the rapid exploration of new physical capabilities, providing greatly improved performance portability, and working toward full interoperability between classes of components. More specifically, ADAPT implements fundamental software techniques that can be used in many-core systems to efficiently execute MPI-based applications and to tolerate fail-stop process failures, at scales ranging from current large systems to the extreme scale systems that are coming soon. To improve the efficiency of Open MPI, ADAPT integrates, as a core component, knowledge about the hardware architecture, and allows all layers of the software stack full access to this information. Process placement, distributed topologies, file accesses, point-to-point and collective communications can then adapt to such topological information, providing more portability. The ADAPT team is also updating the current collective communication layer to allow for a task-based collective description contained at a group-level, which in turn adjusts to the intra and inter-node topology. Planned expansion of the current code with resilient capabilities allows Open MPI to efficiently survive hard and soft error types of failures. These capabilities can be used as building blocks for all currently active fault tolerance proposals in the MPI standard body.<br/>MPI is already one of the most relevant parallel programming models, the most important brick of most parallel applications, and one of the most critical communication pieces of most other programing models. Thus, the experience of the research team and emerging capabilities can benefit all future users of these programming standards, tools, and libraries--regardless of discipline. Any improvement in the performance and capabilities of a major MPI library such as Open MPI, has tremendous potential for an immediate and dramatic impact on the application communities. In addition to improving the time to solution for their applications, it has the potential to decrease the energy usage and maximize the performance delivered by the existing execution platforms. The scale at which the Open MPI library is used in government research institutions (including universities and national laboratories), as well as in the private sector, is a major vector for a quick impact on all scientific and engineering communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339820","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Collaborative Research: ADAPT: Next Generation Message Passing Interface (MPI) Library - Open MPI"

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create significant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC?s Stampede system, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a significant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This confluence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this work. <br/><br/>To address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi&#64257;cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. <br/><br/>This work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualization capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that efficiently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs. In addition, the project team will disseminate this work to the general public through NSF XD program, the VisIt visualization toolkit and by exhibiting at forums such as IEEE Visualization, IEEE High Performance Graphics and ACM Supercomputing.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339881","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: A Comprehensive Ray Tracing Framework for Visualization in Distributed-Memory Parallel Environments"

Thus there is a well-established user network in place to convert improvements in ADCIRC into significant broader impacts. The proposed research provides transformative intellectual contributions that focus on applying new parallelization schemes to enable major advances in the algorithms, implementation and utilization of the ADCIRC model. The broadening of ADCIRC to a multi-algorithmic framework and the resulting performance gains that are anticipated will help ensure ADCIRC's sustainability as a core community model for at least the next 20 years. In addition, the proposed collaboration will impact computer science by serving as a high impact use case to inform the design of new approaches to efficient scalable computing. Together, the advancements in coastal modeling and parallelization technology will make a significant contribution to the science of modeling and HPC. The results of the proposed research will be disseminated to a wider community through ongoing educational outreach activities at the participating organizations as well as through refereed conference and journal papers, and invited presentations.

We will do this by creating a living, evolving coastal modeling framework that will continue to lead the community in merging physical science / engineering and high performance computing and we will make the framework available to the broader community as a sustainable long term solution for its coastal modeling needs. In addition we will utilize these advancements in the highly demanding coastal storm surge forecasting system that we presently operate to demonstrate both improved robustness and speed of the model solution.

Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation. This project will sustain MESA as a key piece of software infrastructure for stellar astrophysics while building new scientific and educational networks.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339581","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSE: Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics"

The Critical Zone is Earth's permeable near-surface layer - from the atmosphere at the vegetation's canopy to the lower boundary of actively circulating groundwaters. The Critical Zone was a term coined by the National Research Council's Basic Research Opportunities in the Earth Sciences (BROES) Report (2001) to highlight the imperative for a new approach to thoroughly multi-disciplinary research on the zone of the Earth?s surface that is critical to sustaining terrestrial life on our planet. In January 2013, 103 members of the CZ community met for the CZ-EarthCube Domain Workshop (NSF Award #1252238) to prioritize the CZ community's key science drivers, key computational and information technology (""cyber"") challenges and key cyber needs. They identified that the central scientific challenge of the critical zone science community is to develop a ""grand unifying theory"" of the critical zone through a theory-model-data fusion approach. Work participants unanimously described that the key missing need of this approach was a future cyberinfrastructure for seamless 4D visual exploration of the integrated knowledge (data, model outputs and interpolations) from all the bio and geoscience disciplines relevant to critical zone structure and function, similar to today?s ability to easily explore historical satellite imagery and photographs of the earth's surface using Google Earth.

The entire BiG CZ Software system will be developed on public repositories as a modular suite of fully open source software projects.

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create significant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC?s Stampede system, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a significant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This confluence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this work. <br/><br/>To address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi&#64257;cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. <br/><br/>This work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualization capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that efficiently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs. In addition, the project team will disseminate this work to the general public through NSF XD program, the VisIt visualization toolkit and by exhibiting at forums such as IEEE Visualization, IEEE High Performance Graphics and ACM Supercomputing.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339863","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: A Comprehensive Ray Tracing Framework for Visualization in Distributed-Memory Parallel Environments"

According to the US Energy Information Administration, buildings consume more energy than any other sector, with 48.7% of the overall energy consumption, and building energy consumption is projected to grow faster than the consumptions of industry and transportation sectors. As a response to this, by 2030 only 18% of the US building stock is expected to be relying on the current energy management technologies, with the rest either having been retrofitted or designed from the ground up using smart and cleaner energy technologies. These building energy management systems (BEMSs) need to integrate large volumes of data, including (a) continuously collected heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) sensor and actuation data, (b) other sensory data, such as occupancy, humidity, lighting levels, air speed and quality, (c) architectural, mechanical, and building automation system configuration data for these buildings, (d) local whether and GIS data that provide contextual information, as well as (e) energy price, consumption, and cost data from electricity (such as smart grid) and gas utilities. In theory, these data can be leveraged from the initial design and/or retrofitting of buildings with data driven building optimization (including the evaluation of the building location, orientation, and alternative energy-saving strategies) to total cost of ownership (TCOs) simulation tools and day-to-day operation decisions. In practice, however, because of the size and complexity of the data, the varying spatial and temporal scales at which the key processes operate, (a) creating models to support such simulations, (b) executing simulations that involve 100s of inter-dependent parameters spanning multiple spatio-temporal frames, affected by complex dynamic processes operating at different resolutions, and (c) analyzing simulation results are extremely costly. The energy simulation data management system (e-SDMS) software will address challenges that arise from the need to model, index, search, visualize, and analyze, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate series resulting from observations and simulations. e-SDMS will, therefore, fill an important hole in data-driven building design and clean-energy (an area of national priority) and will enable applications and services with significant economic and environmental impact.<br/><br/>The key observations driving the research is that many data sets of urgent interest to energy simulations include the following: (a) voluminous, (b) heterogeneous, (c) multi-variate, (d) temporal, (e) inter-related (meaning that the parameters of interest are dependent on each other and constrained with the structure of the building), and (f) multi-resolution (meaning that simulations and observations cover days to months of data and may be considered at different granularities of space, time, and parameters). Moreover, generating an appropriate ensemble of simulations for decision making often requires multiple simulations, each with different parameters settings corresponding to slightly different, but plausible, scenarios. Therefore, significant savings in modeling and analysis can be obtained through data management software supporting modular re-use of existing simulation results in new settings, such as re-contextualization and modular recomposition (or ""sketching"") of building models and if-then analysis of simulation traces under new parameters, new building floorplans, and new contexts. In developing the energy simulation data management system (e-SDMS), the research addresses the key data challenges that render data-driven energy simulations, today, difficult. This requires (a) a novel building models, simulation traces, and sensor/actuation traces (BSS) data model to accommodate energy simulation data and models, (b) feature analysis and indexing of sensory data and simulation traces along with the corresponding building models, and (c) algorithms for analysis and exploration of simulation traces and re-contextualization of models for new building plans and contextual metadata. This research will therefore, impact computational challenges that arise from the need to model, analyze, index, visualize, search, and recompose, in a scalable manner, large volumes of multi-variate series resulting from energy observations and simulations. E-SDMS consists of an (a) eViz server, which works as a frontend to e-SDMS, an (b) eDMS middleware for feature extraction, indexing, simulation analysis, and sketching, and an (c) eStore backend for data storage. To avoid waste and achieve scalabilities needed for managing large data sets, e-SDMS employs novel multi-resolution data partitioning and resource allocation strategies. The multi-resolution data encoding, partitioning, and analysis algorithms are efficiently computable, leverage massive parallelism, and result in high quality, compact data descriptions.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339835","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: E-SDMS: Energy Simulation Data Management System Software"

Technical advances in detectors, computer processing power, networks and data storage have enabled new sky surveys. Many of these search for transient events at optical wavelengths, such as the Palomar Transient Factory and Pan-STARRS1 that probe ever-larger areas of the sky and ever-fainter sources, opening up the vast discovery space of ""time domain astronomy"". The recent Kepler and COROT space missions achieved nearly continuous monitoring of more than 100,000 stars. The stellar discoveries from these surveys include revelations about stellar evolution, rare stars, unusual explosion outcomes, and remarkably complex binary star systems. The immediate future holds tremendous promise, as both the space-based survey Gaia and the ground based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope come to fruition. This tsunami of data has created a new demand for a reliable and publicly available research and education tool in computational stellar astrophysics that will reap the full scientific benefits of these discoveries while also creating a collaborative environment where theory, computation and interpretation can come together to address critical scientific issues. This demand by the stellar community led to our release of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project in 2011. MESA has driven, and will continue to drive with support from this award, innovation in the stellar community as well as the exoplanet, galactic, and cosmological communities. Educators have widely deployed MESA in their undergraduate and graduate stellar evolution courses because MESA is a community platform with an active support network for leading-edge scientific investigations. Stellar astrophysics research, and all the communities that rely on stellar astrophysics, will be significantly enhanced by sustaining innovative development of MESA.<br/><br/>This award supports the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software project and user community. MESA solves the 1D fully coupled structure and composition equations governing stellar evolution. It is based on an implicit finite difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls; state-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion, boundary conditions, and changes to the mass of the star. MESA is an open source library that employs contemporary numerical approaches, supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP, and is written with present and future multi-core and multi-thread architectures in mind. MESA combines the robust, efficient, thread-safe numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very-low mass to massive stars. Innovations in MESA and its domain of applicability continues to grow, just recently extended to include giant planets, oscillations, and rotation. This project will sustain MESA as a key piece of software infrastructure for stellar astrophysics while building new scientific and educational networks.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1339606","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSE: Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics"

The tools are collectively called CRESCAT (Computational Research Ecosystem for Scientific Collaboration on Ancient Topics). The initial focus is on disciplines that deal with dynamic interactions and structural changes within spatially situated populations over long time spans in the past, e.g., paleobiology, archaeology, and economic history. Despite their differences, these disciplines have similar computational needs for modeling and analyzing data. Moreover, the same software can be used in many other disciplines, enabling economies of scale by building and maintaining a common set of interoperable tools to serve a wide range of researchers, while spanning the full research data life cycle, consisting of (1) acquisition, (2) integration, (3) analysis, (4) publication, and (5) archiving of data. An intuitive graphical user interface is provided for end-user researchers to work with their data in all stages of the life cycle without cumbersome manual data transfers and transformations. The project will address a major computational problem that affects many scientific disciplines due to the challenge of integrating and analyzing data of diverse origins based on heterogeneous spatial, temporal, and taxonomic ontologies. Thus it will have a broad impact in the sciences and beyond by showing how to represent explicitly the full variability of individual judgments and the divergent conceptualizations and terminologies through which those judgments are expressed, with explicit attribution of each observation, interpretation, and conceptual ontology to a particular named person or group. Unlike many computational tools for scientific research, which assume a degree of ontological consensus that does not exist, CRESCAT conforms to actual research practices. It does not impose a standardized ontology, thereby ignoring or suppressing the inevitable disagreements and conflicting interpretations that arise among researchers. Instead, it represents ontological diversity, observational uncertainty, and interpretive disagreement explicitly within a larger common framework in which end users can query, analyze, and compare the full range of observations, interpretations, and terminologies to inform their own judgments about the evidence. CRESCAT is designed to allow scientific disagreements and observational and interpretive uncertainties to be represented digitally in a way that exposes these differences themselves as data for analysis and debate. Thus, in addition to the practical goal of building a more efficient shared framework for advanced research, the proposed work will provoke theoretical reflection about how computational tools should relate to scientific practice.<br/><br/>The CRESCAT project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, paleobiologists, geoscientists, archaeologists, economic historians, and other social scientists. The goal is to demonstrate the value of an integrative software ecosystem that spans the social and natural sciences and can facilitate any research characterized by overlapping models of temporal and spatial relations or by conflicting terminologies and taxonomies. CRESCAT's representation of scientific knowledge eschews forced standardization, which is impractical in many cases due to lack of an enforcement mechanism and is also questionable in principle since divergent ontologies often legitimately reflect different theoretical assumptions and research agendas. Central to the CRESCAT suite of tools is an innovative data-integration system that represents explicitly both research data and the ontologies inherent in the data. An ontology is defined here as a conceptual model of entities and the relationships among them in a given domain of knowledge, in contrast to a schema,&#148;which is the implementation of an ontology in logical data structures within a working system. CRESCAT's data-integration system operates at a level of abstraction sufficient to provide a predictable and efficiently queryable database structure based on an abstract global schema, which in turn is based on an upper ontology specified in terms of fundamental concepts and relationships applicable to all scientific and scholarly disciplines. The data-integration system is implemented in an enterprise-class XML/XQuery DBMS that serves as a data warehouse (using the non-relational graph data model), in which is stored diverse data from a wide range of research projects representing many disciplines. The terminology and conceptual distinctions of each research project are fully preserved. The approach to research data taken in the CRESCAT project is (1) coherent, tightly integrating software tools and data formats within a single analytical framework; (2) open-ended, interconnecting existing tools while allowing the addition of new tools in the future; (3) non-exclusive, in no way preventing its component tools from participating in other software ecosystems; (4) scalable, designed to handle large-scale data management, analysis, and visualization; and (5) sustainable, maintaining shared resources to meet common needs for software and technical support and thus enabling substantial economies of scale.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450455","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: CRESCAT, A Computational Research Ecosystem for Scientific Collaboration on Ancient Topics, Spanning the Full Data Life Cycle"

Tools to measure application performance in these increasingly complex environments must also increase the richness of their measurements to provide insights into the increasingly intricate ways in which software and hardware interact. The PAPI performance-monitoring library has provided a clear, portable interface to the hardware performance counters available on all modern CPUs and some other components of interest (scattered across the chip and system). Widely deployed and widely used, PAPI has established itself as fundamental software infrastructure, not only for the scientific computing community, but for many industry users of HPC as well. But the radical changes in processor and system design that have occurred over the past several years pose new challenges to PAPI and the HPC software infrastructure as a whole. The PAPI-EX project integrates critical PAPI enhancements that flow from both governmental and industry research investments, focusing on processor and system design changes that are expected to be present in every extreme scale platform on the path to exascale computing.<br/><br/>The primary impact of PAPI-EX is a direct function of the importance of the PAPI library. PAPI has been in predominant use by tool developers, major national HPC centers, system vendors, and application developers for over 15 years. PAPI-EX builds on that foundation. As important research infrastructure, the PAPI-EX project allows PAPI to continue to play its essential role in the face of the revolutionary changes in the design and scale of new systems. In terms of enhancing discovery and education, the list of partners working with PAPI-EX includes NSF computing centers, major tool developers, major system vendors, and individual community leaders, and this diverse group will help facilitate training sessions, targeted workshops, and mini-symposia at national and international meetings. Finally, the active promotion of PAPI by many major system vendors means that PAPI, and therefore PAPI-EX, will continue to deliver major benefits for government and industry in many domains.<br/><br/>PAPI-EX addresses a hardware environment in which the cores of current and future multicore CPUs share various performance-critical resources (a.k.a., 'inter-core' resources), including power management, on-chip networks, the memory hierarchy, and memory controllers between cores. Failure to manage contention for these 'inter-core' resources has already become a major drag on overall application performance. Consequently, the lack of ability to reveal the actual behavior of these resources at a low level, has become very problematic for the users of the many performance tools (e.g., TAU, HPCToolkit, Open|SpeedShop, Vampir, Scalasca, CrayPat, Active Harmony, etc.). PAPI-EX enhances and extends PAPI to solve this critical problem and prepare it to play its well-established role in HPC performance optimization. Accordingly, PAPI-EX targets the following objectives: (1) Develop shared hardware counter support that includes system-wide and inter-core measurements; (2) Provide support for data-flow based runtime systems; (3) Create a sampling interface to record streams of performance data with relevant context; (4) Combine an easy-to-use tool for text-based application performance analysis with updates to PAPI?s high-level API to create a basic, ?out of the box? instrumentation API.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450122","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSI: Collaborative Proposal: Performance Application Programming Interface for Extreme-Scale Environments (PAPI-EX)"

Models are used to study a wide range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, flooding, plant growth, landslide occurrence, and many other processes. Models can be used to develop scientific understanding by comparing model calculations with the real world. They can also be used to make predictions about how nature will behave under certain conditions. In the areas of geosciences that deal with the earth's surface, one bottleneck in the development and use of models is the effort required to build, test, and debug the necessary software. This project contributes to scientific research and discovery by creating open source software tools that scientists can use to more efficiently create, modify, or combine computer models that represent portions of earth's surface and the processes occurring thereon. The project combines software development with user training and web-based resources, so that the products will be openly accessible, well documented, and widely disseminated within the relevant scientific communities. The project also contributes to K-12, undergraduate, and graduate-level education in computational modeling and earth-surface processes.<br/><br/>This project catalyzes research in earth-surface dynamics by developing a software framework that enables rapid creation, refinement, and reuse of two-dimensional (2D) numerical models. The phrase earth-surface dynamics refers to a remarkably diverse group of science and engineering fields that deal with our planet's surface and near-surface environment: its processes, its management, and its responses to natural and human-made perturbations. Scientists who want to use an earth-surface model often build their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their model rather than taking advantage of codes that have already been written. Whereas the end result may be novel software programs, many person-hours are lost rewriting existing code, and the resulting software is often idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and unable to interact with other software programs in the same scientific community and beyond, leading to lost opportunities for exploring an even wider array of scientific questions than those that can be addressed using a single model. The Landlab model framework seeks to eliminate these redundancies and lost opportunities, and simultaneously lower the bar for entry into numerical modeling, by creating a user- and developer-friendly software library that provides scientists with the fundamental building blocks needed for modeling earth-surface dynamics. The framework takes advantage of the fact that nearly all surface-dynamics models share a set of common software elements, despite the wide range of processes and scales that they encompass. Providing these elements in the context of a popular scientific programming environment, with strong user support and community engagement, contributes to accelerating progress in the diverse sciences of the earth's surface.<br/><br/>The Landlab modeling framework is designed so that grid creation, data storage, and sharing of data among process components is done for the user. The framework is generic enough so that the coupling of two process components, whether they are squarely within a geoscience subdiscipline, or they cross subdisciplines, is the same. This architecture makes it easy to explore a wide range of questions in the geosciences without the need for much coding. Further, the model code is primarily written in Python, a language that is relatively easy for casual programmers to learn. Because of these attributes, the Landlab modeling framework has the potential to add computational modeling to the toolbox of a wide array of geoscientists, and to clear a path for trans-disciplinary earth-surface modeling that explores societally relevant topics, such as land-cover changes in response to climate change, as well as modeling of topics that currently require the coupling of sophisticated but harder-to-use models, such as sediment source-to-sink dynamics. The project will generate several proof-of-concept studies that are interesting in their own right, and demonstrate the capabilities of the modeling framework. Community engagement is fostered by presenting clinics and demonstrations at professional venues aimed at hydrologists, sedimentologists, critical zone scientists, and the broader earth and environmental sciences community. The team also supports visits by individual scientists for on-site training beyond these clinics. Input/output tools allow compatibility with data from relevant NSF-supported research. The project supports four graduate students and three postdoctoral researchers, and also includes modeling workshops for fifth to seventh grade girls in a community that has a greater than 50% minority population.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450412","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Landlab: A Flexible, Open-Source Modeling Framework for Earth-Surface Dynamics"

These gateways are fostering collaboration and exchange of ideas among thousands of researchers from multiple communities ranging from atmospheric science, astrophysics, chemistry, biophysics, biochemistry, earthquake engineering, geophysics, to neuroscience, and biology. However due to limited development and administrative personnel resources, science gateways often leverage only a small subset of the NSF-funded CI to mitigate the complexities involved with using multiple resource and services at scale in part due to software and hardware failures. Since many successful science gateways have had unprecedented growth in their user base and ever increasing datasets, increasing their usage of CI resources without introducing additional complexity would help them meet this demand.<br/><br/>In response to this need, an Automated Monitoring AnalySis Service (AMASS) will be built to provide a flexible and extensible service for automated analysis of monitoring data initially focused on science gateways. AMASS will be based on data mining and machine learning techniques and emerging big data technologies to analyze monitoring data for improving the reliability and operational efficiency of CI as well as progress on fundamental questions in systematic and population biology, computational neuroscience, and biophysics communities. Along with AMASS, a simulation framework will be built for testing automated analysis algorithms and adaptive execution techniques. An intuitive query API will be provided for science gateway software to use and will be integrated into the following three target science gateways that will drive the project's research and development: the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES), the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), and UltraScan. The proposed approach does not require any changes to the end user applications, and the software developments will significantly enhance the science productivity and user satisfaction of science gateways by integrating monitoring data into their infrastructure to enable adaptive execution of their applications, allowing scientists to answer more sophisticated questions without having to understand the complexities of a large-scale distributed environment.

A large variety of scientific applications in use today are based on MPI. On the current and next-generation High-End Computing (HEC) systems, it is essential to understand the interaction between time-critical applications and the underlying MPI implementations in order to better optimize them for both scalability and performance. Current users of HEC systems develop their applications with high-performance MPI implementations, but analyze and fine tune the behavior using standalone performance tools. Essentially, each software component views the other as a blackbox, with little sharing of information or access to capabilities that might be useful in optimization strategies. Lack of a standardized interface that allows interaction between the profiling tool and the MPI library has been a big impediment. The newly introduced MPI_T interface in the MPI-3 standard provides a simple mechanism that allows MPI implementers to expose variables representing configuration parameters or performance measurements from within the implementation for the benefit of tools, tuning frameworks, and other support libraries. However, few performance analysis and tuning tools take advantage of the MPI_T interface and none do so to dynamically optimize at execution time. This research and development effort aims to build a software infrastructure for MPI performance engineering using the new MPI_T interface.<br/><br/>With the adoption of MPI_T in the MPI standard, it is now possible to take positive steps to realize close interaction between and integration of MPI libraries and performance tools. This research, undertaken by a team of computer scientists from OSU and UO representing the open source MVAPICH and TAU projects, aims to create an open source integrated software infrastructure built on the MPI_T interface which defines the API for interaction and information interchange to enable fine grained performance optimizations for HPC applications. The challenges addressed by the project include: 1) enhancing existing support for MPI_T in MVAPICH to expose a richer set of performance and control variables; 2) redesigning TAU to take advantage of the new MPI_T variables exposed by MVAPICH; 3) extending and enhancing TAU and MVAPICH with the ability to generate recommendations and performance engineering reports; 4) proposing fundamental design changes to make MPI libraries like MVAPICH ``reconfigurable'' at runtime; and 5) adding support to MVAPICH and TAU for interactive performance engineering sessions. The framework will be validated on a variety of HPC benchmarks and applications. The integrated middleware and tools will be made publicly available to the community. The research will have a significant impact on enabling optimizations of HPC applications that have previously been difficult to provide. As a result, it will contribute to deriving ""best practice"" guidelines for running on next-generation Multi-Petaflop and Exascale systems.

This type of flow is also naturally present in the environment. Examples are the formation of a mixture of air and solid particles due to volcanic eruptions, and particles of sand and other materials transported by the wind. Scientists and engineers use software to study how these flows behave in order to improve the yield of industrial processes, reduce their environmental impact, and energy consumption. The computer programs used to perform these studies solve complex mathematical problems, and require powerful computers to be able to obtain the results in a useful time. This project focuses on developing the next generation of computer software for the simulation of multiphase flows, enabling it to use the latest generation of computers which combine traditional and graphical processors for improved performance. This software will be released to the public and will enable, scientists and engineers from different research areas to tackle real-world problems by taking advantage of the latest developments in multiphase flow science, combined with the benefit of being able to use the software on powerful computer infrastructures. Students and educators will be able to use the software and learn about multiphase flows through the examples and the documentation that will be provided.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project will be achieved by first developing computational models to describe turbulent flows in the framework of quadrature-based moment methods, an efficient and accurate approach to describe this type of flows. These computational models will then be implemented, together with appropriate numerical methods that will ensure the accuracy of the computational codes, in the open-source framework OpenFOAM. Three representative problems of typical multiphase flows will be considered: a population balance equation for particles with negligible inertia, such as in the formation of nanoparticles in a fluid flow; the description of gas-liquid flows, where the bubble inertia is small but not zero; and the most complex case of gas-solid flows, where particle inertia is large. The possibility of using graphical processing units will be added to the OpenFOAM framework, to enable it to run on hybrid computational systems involving traditional processors and graphical processing units. The source code and its documentation will be made available to the public at an early stage of their development, under the GNU GPL 3 license, in order to disseminate the results of the research and gather feedback. Detailed code documentation, verification and validation cases, and tutorials will also be created to favor external contributions to the software.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1440443","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: A Next-Generation Open-Source Computational Fluid Dynamic Code for Polydisperse Multiphase Flows in Science and Engineering"

Fields in health and biology are significantly benefited by data clustering scalability. Bioinformatic problems such as Micro Array clustering, Protein-Protein interaction clustering, medical resource decision making, medical image processing, and clustering of epidemiological events all serve to benefit from larger dataset sizes. The algorithm under development, called Random Projection Hash or RPHash, utilizes aspects of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) and multi-probe random projection for computational scalability and linear achievable gains from parallel speed. Furthermore, RPHash provides data anonymization through destructive manipulation of the data preventing de-anonymization attacks beyond standard best practices database security methods. RPHash will be deployable on commercially available cloud resources running the Hadoop (MRv2) implementation of MapReduce. The exploitation of general purpose cloud processing solutions allows researchers to scale their processing needs using virtually limitless commercial processing resources.<br/><br/>The RPHash algorithm uses various recent techniques in data mining along with a new approach toward achieving algorithmic scalability on distributed systems. The basic intuition of RPHash is to combine multi-probe random projection with discrete space quantization. Regions of high density are then regarded as centroid candidates. To follow common parameterized, k-means methods, the top k regions will be selected. The focus on a randomized, and thus non-deterministic, clustering algorithm is somewhat uncommon in computing, but common for ill-posed, combinatorially restrictive problems such as clustering and partitioning.

To facilitate the deployment of this software in a range of scientific and engineering applications, this project will develop new software capabilities in concert with new computer models that use the software. Specific application domains to be advanced in this project include models of aquatic locomotion that can be used to understand the neural control of movement and ultimately to develop new treatments for neurological pathologies such as spinal cord injuries, and models that simulate the interaction between the electrophysiology of the heart and the contractions of the heart that pump blood throughout the body, which could lead to improved approaches to treating heart disease. The software to be developed within the project is freely available online and is used by a number of independent research groups in a variety of scientific and engineering domains. It is being actively used in projects that model different aspects of cardiovascular dynamics, such as platelet aggregation and the dynamics of natural and prosthetic heart valves, and in projects that study other biological problems, including cancer dynamics, insect flight, aquatic locomotion, and the dynamics of phytoplankton. The software is also being applied to non-biological problems, including nanoscale models of colloidal suspensions and models of active particles.

This methodology is broadly useful, however, and has been applied to a variety of problems in which a fluid flow interacts with immersed structures, including elastic bodies, bodies with known or prescribed deformational kinematics, and rigid bodies. Extensions of the IB method have also been developed to model electrophysiological systems and systems with chemically active structures. To improve the efficiency of the IB method, the PI has developed adaptive versions of the IB method that employ structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) to deploy high spatial resolution only where needed. These methods have been implemented within the IBAMR software framework, which provides parallel implementations of the IB method and its extensions that leverage high-quality computational libraries including SAMRAI, PETSc, and libMesh. This project will further extend the IBAMR software by implementing modeling and discretization technologies required by the research applications of current and prospective users of the software, by developing improved solver infrastructure facilitated by the implementation of native support for structured AMR discretizations in the PETSc library, and by integrating with existing high-quality software tools for model development, deployment, and analysis. IBAMR is freely distributed online and is used within a number of independent research groups both to the further development of the IB method and also to its application to simulate diverse problems in fluid dynamics and FSI. By enhancing IBAMR, this project will also enhance the ability of these and other researchers to construct detailed models without requiring those researchers to develop the significant software infrastructure needed to perform such simulations. This project will also develop general-purpose support for AMR discretizations in PETSc, a software library with thousands of active users, ~400 downloads per month, and numerous applications.

Yet, this same complex infrastructure is threatening the continued use of fault tolerance. Consider when a single application or hardware device crashes. Today, in order to resume that application from the point where it crashed, one must also consider the complex subsystem to which it belongs. While in the past, many developers would write application-specific code to support fault tolerance for a single application, this strategy is no longer feasible when restarting the many inter-connected applications of a complex subsystem. This project will support a plugin architecture for transparent checkpoint-restart. Transparency implies that the software developer does not need to write any application-specific code. The plugin architecture implies that each software developer writes the necessary plugins only once. Each plugin takes responsibility for resuming any interrupted sessions for just one particular component. At a higher level, the checkpoint-restart system employs an ensemble of autonomous plugins operating on all of the applications of a complex subsystem, without any need for application-specific code.<br/><br/>The plugin architecture is part of a more general approach called process virtualization, in which all subsystems external to a process are virtualized. It will be built on top of the DMTCP checkpoint-restart system. One simple example of process virtualization is virtualization of ids. A plugin maintains a virtualization table and arranges for the application code of the process to see only virtual ids, while the outside world sees the real id. Any system calls and library calls using this real id are extended to translate between real and virtual id. On restart, the real ids are updated with the latest value, and the process memory remains unmodified, since it contains only virtual ids. Other techniques employing process virtualization include shadow device drivers, record-replay logs, and protocol virtualization. Some targets of the research include transparent checkpoint-restart support for the InfiniBand network, for programmable GPUs (including shaders), for networks of virtual machines, for big data systems such as Hadoop, and for mobile computing platforms such as Android.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1440788","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Enhancement and Support of DMTCP for Adaptive, Extensible Checkpoint-Restart"

Examples abound in spectral graph partitioning, large scale spectral graph analysis, structural engineering, electromagnetics, lattice Quantum Chromodynamics, and electronic structure applications from atomic scale physics to molecular scale materials science. Closely related is the problem of computing a partial Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of a matrix, which finds everyday use in numerous applications including data mining and machine learning. The importance of the problem is evidenced by the significant resources that have been invested over the last decade in developing high quality eigenvalue software packages. However, these packages still do not include the near-optimal methods that have made the package PRIMME the software to beat. PRIMME, or PReconditioned Iterative MultiMethod Eigensolver, is a software package developed in 2005 for the solution of HEP. PRIMME brings state-of-the-art preconditioned iterative methods from ""bleeding edge"" to production, with a flexible, yet highly usable interface. Yet, it is its focus on numerical robustness and computational efficiency that has gained PRIMME the recognition as one of the best eigenvalue packages. This success calls for a new effort to extend PRIMME with some long awaited functionality but also to include new algorithms to address some outstanding problems in eigenvalue computations. This work is critical to many groups whose research depends on the lattice QCD and materials science software packages that PRIMME will improve through collaborations. PRIMME already has a PETSc interface, and with the proposed development of Hypre and Trilinos interfaces, it will be accessible by a far wider community of users. The most requested feature, however, has been a MATLAB interface. This will unleash the power of an ""industrial strength"" software to end users. Last but not least, this project will educate and train two graduate and several undergraduate students in the art of high performance numerical software.<br/><br/>Specific goals for this projects include: PRIMME extension to GHEP, with special attention to ill conditioned mass matrices; PRIMME extension to SVD, with special attention to obtaining results at high accuracy (the solution must include not only PRIMME's robust components but a combination of known and new methods, as well as a dynamic way to choose between them); implementation of new methods and techniques for the solution of highly interior eigenvalue problems and for the computation of a large number of eigenvalues; interoperability with DOE libraries and MATLAB, and improved means of dissemination. As a numerical linear algebra kernel, PRIMME has a large potential audience in the computational sciences community.

Models are used to study a wide range of phenomena, such as soil erosion, flooding, plant growth, landslide occurrence, and many other processes. Models can be used to develop scientific understanding by comparing model calculations with the real world. They can also be used to make predictions about how nature will behave under certain conditions. In the areas of geosciences that deal with the earth's surface, one bottleneck in the development and use of models is the effort required to build, test, and debug the necessary software. This project contributes to scientific research and discovery by creating open source software tools that scientists can use to more efficiently create, modify, or combine computer models that represent portions of earth's surface and the processes occurring thereon. The project combines software development with user training and web-based resources, so that the products will be openly accessible, well documented, and widely disseminated within the relevant scientific communities. The project also contributes to K-12, undergraduate, and graduate-level education in computational modeling and earth-surface processes.<br/><br/>This project catalyzes research in earth-surface dynamics by developing a software framework that enables rapid creation, refinement, and reuse of two-dimensional (2D) numerical models. The phrase earth-surface dynamics refers to a remarkably diverse group of science and engineering fields that deal with our planet's surface and near-surface environment: its processes, its management, and its responses to natural and human-made perturbations. Scientists who want to use an earth-surface model often build their own unique model from the ground up, re-coding the basic building blocks of their model rather than taking advantage of codes that have already been written. Whereas the end result may be novel software programs, many person-hours are lost rewriting existing code, and the resulting software is often idiosyncratic, poorly documented, and unable to interact with other software programs in the same scientific community and beyond, leading to lost opportunities for exploring an even wider array of scientific questions than those that can be addressed using a single model. The Landlab model framework seeks to eliminate these redundancies and lost opportunities, and simultaneously lower the bar for entry into numerical modeling, by creating a user- and developer-friendly software library that provides scientists with the fundamental building blocks needed for modeling earth-surface dynamics. The framework takes advantage of the fact that nearly all surface-dynamics models share a set of common software elements, despite the wide range of processes and scales that they encompass. Providing these elements in the context of a popular scientific programming environment, with strong user support and community engagement, contributes to accelerating progress in the diverse sciences of the earth's surface.<br/><br/>The Landlab modeling framework is designed so that grid creation, data storage, and sharing of data among process components is done for the user. The framework is generic enough so that the coupling of two process components, whether they are squarely within a geoscience subdiscipline, or they cross subdisciplines, is the same. This architecture makes it easy to explore a wide range of questions in the geosciences without the need for much coding. Further, the model code is primarily written in Python, a language that is relatively easy for casual programmers to learn. Because of these attributes, the Landlab modeling framework has the potential to add computational modeling to the toolbox of a wide array of geoscientists, and to clear a path for trans-disciplinary earth-surface modeling that explores societally relevant topics, such as land-cover changes in response to climate change, as well as modeling of topics that currently require the coupling of sophisticated but harder-to-use models, such as sediment source-to-sink dynamics. The project will generate several proof-of-concept studies that are interesting in their own right, and demonstrate the capabilities of the modeling framework. Community engagement is fostered by presenting clinics and demonstrations at professional venues aimed at hydrologists, sedimentologists, critical zone scientists, and the broader earth and environmental sciences community. The team also supports visits by individual scientists for on-site training beyond these clinics. Input/output tools allow compatibility with data from relevant NSF-supported research. The project supports four graduate students and three postdoctoral researchers, and also includes modeling workshops for fifth to seventh grade girls in a community that has a greater than 50% minority population.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450409","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Landlab: A Flexible, Open-Source Modeling Framework for Earth-Surface Dynamics"

Existing infrastructures pose significant barriers to this access, especially for small to mid-size research groups and primarily undergraduate institutions: cloud services disappear when funding runs out to pay for them and therefore do not provide the long-term availability required for curated data. Similarly, in-house IT infrastructure is maintenance-intensive and requires dedicated resources for which long-term funding is often unavailable. The goal of the Big Weather Web is to make in-house IT infrastructure affordable by combining the application of three recent technologies: virtualization, federated smart storage, and big data management. Virtualization allows push-button deployment and maintenance of complex systems, smart storage provides automatic, community-wide data availability guarantees, and big data management allows for easy curation of data and its products. The combination of these three technologies allows communities to create a standard community-specific computational environment and efficiently refine it with minimal repetition of work, introducing a high degree of reproducibility in research and education. This reproducibility accelerates learning and amplifies everyone?s contribution. Due to virtualization, it can easily take advantage of cloud services whenever they become available, and it can run on in-house IT infrastructure using significantly reduced maintenance resources. The Big Weather Web will be developed in the context of numerical weather prediction with the expectation that the resulting infrastructure can be easily adapted to other data-intensive scientific communities.<br/><br/>The volume, variety, and velocity of scientific data generated is growing exponentially. Small to mid-size research groups and especially primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) do not have the resources to manage large amounts of data locally and share their data products globally at high availability. This lack of resources has a number of consequences in education and research that have been well-documented in recent EarthCube workshops: (1) data-intensive scientific results are not easily reproducible, whether in the context of research or education, (2) limited or non-existent availability of intermediate results causes a lot of unnecessary duplication of work and makes learning curves unnecessarily steep, and consequently (3) scientific communities of practice are falling behind technological innovations. This Big Weather Web project focuses on the numerical weather prediction community. Numerical weather models produce terabytes of output per day, comprising a wealth of information that can be used for research and education, but this amount of data is difficult to transfer, store, or analyze for most universities. The Big Weather Web addresses this situation with the design, implementation, and deployment of ""nuclei,"" which are shared artifacts that enable reliable and efficient access and sharing of data, encode best practices, and are sustainably maintained and improved by the community. These nuclei use existing and well-established technologies, but the integration of these technologies will significantly reduce the resource burden mentioned above. Nucleus 1 is a large ensemble distributed over seven universities. Nucleus 2 is a common storage, linking, and cataloging methodology implemented as an appliance-like Data Investigation and Sharing Environment (DISE) that is extremely easy to maintain and that automatically ensures data availability and safety. Nucleus 3 is a versioned virtualization and container technology for easy deployment and reproducibility of computational environments. Together, these nuclei will advance discovery and understanding through sharing of data products and methods to replicate scientific results while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating a shared environment for scientific communities of practice. These shared environments are particularly important for underrepresented groups who otherwise have limited access to knowledge that is primarily propagated by social means. Our approach is a significant step towards improving reproducibility in the complex computational environments found in many scientific communities.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1450168","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSI: Big Weather Web: A Common and Sustainable Big Data Infrastructure in Support of Weather Prediction Research and Education in Universities"

Typical examples include time series measurement or multidimensional volumetric data sets. Due to their rapidly increasing size, these data present severe limitations for data storage, transmission, and processing, and will thus become serious bottlenecks for analysis pipelines and collaborative data analysis. New approaches and frameworks are needed to enable the timely and cost effictive analyses at next generation data scales. The Active Data Processing and Transformation File System (ADAPT FS) combines efficient storage of original data with on-the-fly processing to enable collaborative processing and sharing of scientific datasets at the largest scales with minimal data duplication and latency. The remote access will leverage PSC's SLASH2 distributed filesystem and be extended to provide visualization. ADAPT-FS processing will enable easy access to leading-edge scientific datasets for teaching and training at institutions of all sizes.<br/><br/>ADAPT-FS provides a FUSE based file system interface allowing seamless use from programs or web servers. The guiding principles behind ADAPT-FS are to: 1) eliminate unwanted data duplication; 2) minimize data transfer by working directly from original data when possible; 3) minimize delays between data capture and end-user analyses; and 4) provide a flexible workflow which incorporates active computation. The latter aspect enables improved parallel I/O performance by exploiting untapped CPU and GPU power on the nodes of large data servers. We will provide ADAPT-FS as open source, including a flexible and well-documented API and a plug-in framework enabling users to insert their own GPU and CPU codes into the data pipeline to extend and customize its data processing capabilities. Thus, ADAPT-FS will provide a critical technology to tackle the next generation of massive data intensive processing, allowing efficient and rapid analysis of petabytes size data sets with minimal data duplication in a collaborative multi-site framework.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1440756","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: An Active File System for Processing and Sharing Petascale Multi-Dimentional Datasets"

To address this need, this project will overhaul, integrate, and enhance static binary analysis and runtime technologies to produce components that provide a foundation for performance, correctness, and security tools. The project will build upon three successful and widely adopted open source software packages: the DynInst library for analysis and transformation of application binaries, the MRNet infrastructure for control of large-scale parallel executions and data analysis of their results, and the HPCToolkit performance analysis tools. The project team will engage the community to participate in the design and evaluation of the emerging components, as well as to adopt its components. <br/><br/>This project will have a wide range of impacts. First, software components built by the project will enable the development of sophisticated, high-quality, end-user performance, correctness, and security tools built by the project team, as well as others in academia, government, and industry. Software developed by the project team will help researchers and developers tackle testing, debugging, monitoring, analysis, and tuning of applications for systems at all scales. Second, end-user tools produced by the project have a natural place in the classroom to help students write efficient, correct, and secure programs. Third, components produced by the project will lower the barrier for new researchers to enter the field and build tools that have impact on production applications without years of investment. Fourth, the project will provide training for graduate students and interns in the area of software for performance, correctness, and security. Finally, through workshops and tutorials, the project will disseminate project results, provide training to enable others to leverage project software, and grow a community of tool researchers who depend on project components and thus have a strong motivation to help sustain project software into the future.<br/><br/>Modernizing open-source software components and tools for binary analysis will enable static analysis of application characteristics at the level of executable machine code, transformation of binaries to inject monitoring code, measurement to capture a detailed record of application?s interactions with all facets of a target platform, analysis of recorded data in parallel, and attribution of analysis results back to application source code in meaningful ways. Providing innovative, software components that support development of robust performance, correctness, and security tools will accelerate innovation by tools researchers and help them grapple with the increasing complexity of modern software.

This project enables application developers to improve performance on future HEC machines for their scientific and engineering processes.

Instead, the project offers an open, transparent software infrastructure -- a Glass Box system -- for creating and tuning large-scale, parallel applications. `Opening up' the tools and services used to create and evaluate peta- and exa-scale codes involves developing interfaces and methods that make tool-internal information and available for new performance management services that improve developer productivity and code efficiency.<br/><br/>The project will explore the information that can be shared 'across the software stack'.

Negrut, Sameh, and Knepley will investigate, produce, and maintain a methodology and its software implementation that leverage emerging heterogeneous hardware architectures to solve billion-unknowns linear systems in a robust, scalable, and efficient fashion. The two classes of problems targeted under this project are banded dense and sparse general linear systems.<br/><br/>This project is motivated by the observation that the task of solving a linear system is one of the most ubiquitous ingredients in the numerical solution of Applied Mathematics problems. It is relied upon for the implicit integration of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and Differential Algebraic Equation (DAE) problems, in the numerical solution of Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems, in interior point optimization methods, in least squares approximations, in solving eigenvalue problems, and in data analysis. In fact, the vast majority of nonlinear problems in Scientific Computing are solved iteratively by drawing on local linearizations of nonlinear operators and the solution of linear systems. Recent advances in (a) hardware architecture; i.e., the emergence of General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GP-GPU) cards, and (b) scalable solution algorithms, provide an opportunity to develop a new class of parallel algorithms, called SPIKE, which can robustly and efficiently solve very large linear systems of equations.<br/><br/>Drawing on its divide-and-conquer paradigm, SPIKE builds on several algorithmic primitives: matrix reordering strategies, dense linear algebra operations, sparse direct solvers, and Krylov subspace methods. It provides a scalable solution that can be deployed in a heterogeneous hardware ecosystem and has the potential to solve billion-unknown linear systems in the cloud or on tomorrow?s exascale supercomputers. Its high degree of scalability and improved efficiency stem from (i) optimized memory access pattern owing to an aggressive pre-processing stage that reduces a generic sparse matrix to a banded one through a novel reordering strategy; (ii) good exposure of coarse and fine grain parallelism owing to a recursive, divide-and-conquer solution strategy; (iii) efficient vectorization in evaluating the coupling terms in the divide-and-conquer stage owing to a CPU+GPU heterogeneous computing approach; and (iv) algorithmic polymorphism, given that SPIKE can serve both as a direct solver or an effective preconditioner in an iterative Krylov-type method.<br/><br/>In Engineering, SPIKE will provide the Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) community with a key component; i.e., fast solution of linear systems, required by the analysis of complex problems through computer simulation. Examples of applications that would benefit from this technology are Structural Mechanics problems (Finite Element Analysis in car crash simulation), Computational Fluid Dynamics problems (solving Navier-Stokes equations in the simulation of turbulent flow around a wing profile), and Computational Multibody Dynamics problems (solving Newton-Euler equations in large granular dynamics problems).<br/><br/>SPIKE will also be interfaced to the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc), a two decades old flexible and scalable framework for solving Science and Engineering problems on supercomputers. Through PETSc, SPIKE will be made available to a High Performance Computing user community with more than 20,000 members worldwide. PETSc users will be able to run SPIKE without any modifications on vastly different supercomputer architectures such as the IBM BlueGene/P and BlueGene/Q, or the Cray XT5. SPIKE will thus run scalably on the largest machines in the world and will be tuned for very different network and hardware topologies while maintaining a simple code base.<br/><br/>The experience collected and lessons learned in this project will augment a graduate level class, ?High Performance Computing for Engineering Applications? taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A SPIKE tutorial and research outcomes will be presented each year at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis. A one day High Performance Computing Boot Camp will be organized each year in conjunction with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) conference and used to disseminate the software outcomes of this effort. Finally, this project will shape the research agendas of two graduate students working on advanced degrees in Computational Science.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1147422","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE Collaborative Research: SPIKE-An Implementation of a Recursive Divide-and-Conquer Parallel Strategy for Solving Large Systems of Liner Equations"

It offers a wide variety of interoperable and extensible tools, integrated in a general purpose mathematical software package, as needed for daily computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics; it is developed by a community of researchers spread around the world and across institutions; and it is open source and depends only on open source software. Among the proposers, Stein is founder and lead developer of Sage while Bump, Musiker, and Schilling are strong contributors to Sage-Combinat. Hivert and Thi�ery (Paris-Sud, Orsay), founders and lead developers of Sage-Combinat, are both strongly affiliated with this project. Some of the research areas addressed in this project include symmetric functions, in particular Macdonald polynomials for arbitrary Cartan types and their nonsymmetric analogues, crystals, rigged configurations and combinatorial R-matrices, affine Weyl groups and Hecke algebras, cluster algebras, and posets.<br/><br/>The project will develop Sage-Combinat in areas relevant to the ongoing research of the participants, together with relevant underlying infrastructure. The project will include three Sage Days workshops, and will be affiliated with a third scheduled workshop at ICERM. These workshops include a strong outreach component and have been a potent tool for connecting researchers and recruiting Sage users and developers. The grant will also fund a dedicated software development and computation server for Sage-Combinat, to be hosted in the Sage computation farm in Seattle. Emphasis will be placed on the development of thematic tutorials that will make the code accessible to new users. The proposal will also fund graduate student RA support, curriculum development, and other mentoring.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1147161","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research: SI2-SSE: Sage-Combinat: Developing and Sharing Open Source Software for Algebraic Combinatorics"

It is difficult to use cloud computing resources for large-scale, high throughput ensemble jobs however. Additionally, the computationally oriented researcher is increasingly encouraged to make data sets available to the broader community. For the latter to be achieved, using capture tools during experimentation to harvest metadata and provenance reduces the manual burden of marking up results. Better automatic capture of metadata and provenance is the only means by which sharing of scientific data can scale to meet the burgeoning explosion of data.<br/><br/>This project develops a pipeline framework for running ensemble simulations on the cloud; the framework has two key components: ensemble deployment and metadata harvest. Regarding the former, on commercial cloud platforms typically a much smaller number of jobs than desired can be started at any one time. An ensemble run will need to be pipelined to a cloud resource, that is, executed in well-controlled batches over a period of time. We will use platform features of Azure, and employ machine learning techniques to continuously refine the pipeline submission strategy and workflow strategies for ensemble parameter specification, pipelined deployment, and metadata capture. Regarding the latter key component, we expect to reduce the burden of sharing scientific datasets resulting from the use of cloud resources through automatic metadata and provenance capture and representation that aligns the metadata with emerging best practices in data sharing and discovery. Ensemble simulations result in complex data sets, whose reuse could be increased by expressive, granule and collection level metadata, including the lineage of the resulting products, to contribute towards trust.<br/><br/>In this project we focus on a compelling and timely application from climate research: One of the more immediate and dangerous impacts of climate change could be a change in the strength of storms that form over the oceans. In addition, as sea level rises due to global warming and melting of the polar ice caps, coastal communities will become increasingly vulnerable to storm surge. There have already been indications that even modest changes in ocean surface temperature can have a disproportionate effect on hurricane strength and the damage inflicted by these storms. In an effort to understand these impacts, modelers turn to predictions generated by hydrodynamic coastal ocean models such as the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. The proposed research advances the knowledge and understanding of probabilistic storm surge products by enhancements to the SLOSH model itself and through mechanisms that take advantage of commercial cloud resources. This knowledge is expected to have application in research, the classroom, and in operational settings.<br/><br/>The broader significance of the project is several-fold. Cloud computing is an important economic driver but it remains difficult for use in computationally driven scientific research. This project lowers the barriers to conducting e-Science research that utilizes cloud resources, specifically Azure. It will contribute tools to help researchers share, preserve, and publicize the scientific data sets that result from their research. Because we focus on and improve an application that predicts storm surge in response to sea level changes and severe storms, our work contributes to societal responses and adaptations to climate change, including planning and building the sustainable, hazard-resilient coastal communities of the future.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1148085","fuchsia_atom","Collaborative Research SI2 SSE: Pipeline Framework for Ensemble Runs on Clouds"

To fill this gap, this project establishes an large international collaborative effort involving key international players to develop an open, web-based infrastructure through which massive and distributed language resources can be easily accessed, in whole or in part, and within which tailored language services can be efficiently composed, disseminated and consumed by researchers, developers, and students. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive network of web services and resources within the NLP community.

The PIs have previously demonstrated the feasibility of efficiently solving H-J equations on GPUs; this effort seeks to both scientific extend previous work as well as solidify the software into a publicly available tool suite.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this effort is the development of efficient algorithmic strategies for mapping numerical methods for solving H-J equations on unstructured meshes to commodity streaming architectures. The proposed work will tackle several important technical challenges. One challenge is maintaining sufficient computational density on the parallel computational units (blocks), especially as we move to 3D unstructured meshes.

The work also focuses on software lifecycle issues such as model formation, verification, prediction, and validation and support the use of petascale computers by earthquake scientists. The goal of the project is to facilitate the incorporation of better theory and data into computationally intensive modeling of earthquake processes. Software will be designed to interface smoothly with OpenSHA, as well as OpenSEES, PEER, and NEES. Project partners will also develop and test two computational platforms, one that will have a user-friendly interface for calculating seismographs and the other will generate large suites of simulations for a layered earthquake hazard model. Models will be validated against datasets for 13 well-recorded historic California earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or higher. The initial API will take advantage of the asynchronous IO features of Fortran 2003 with plans for adding C/C++ and Python interfaces.

Modest to medium research project teams have little cyber security expertise to defend against the increasingly diverse, advanced and constantly evolving attacks. Even larger facilities that have with security expertise are often overwhelmed with the amount of security log data they need to analyze in order to identify attackers and attacks, which is the first step to defending against them. The challenges of the traditional approach of identifying an attacker are amplified by the lack of tools and time to detect attacks skillfully hidden in the noise of ongoing network traffic. The challenge is not necessarily in deploying additional monitoring but to identify this malicious traffic by utilizing all available information found in the plethora of security, network, and system logs that are already being actively collected. This project proposes to build and deploy, is needed in research environments, an advanced log analysis tool, named AttackTagger, that can scale to be able to address the dramatic increase in security log data, and detect emerging threat patterns in today's constantly evolving security landscape. AttackTagger will make science research in support of national priorities more secure.<br/><br/>AttackTagger will be a sophisticated log analysis tool designed to find potentially malicious activity, such as credential theft, by building factor graph models for advanced pattern matching. AttackTagger will integrate with existing security software so as to be easily deployable within existing security ecosystems and to offload processing and computational work onto better suited components. It can consume a wide variety of system and network security logs. AttackTagger accomplishes advanced pattern matching by utilizing a Factor Graph model, which is a type of probabilistic graphical model that can describe complex dependencies among random variables using an undirected graph representation, specifically a bipartite graph. The bipartite graph representation consists of variable nodes representing random variables, factor nodes representing local functions (or factor functions , and edges connecting the two types of nodes. Variable dependencies in a factor graph are expressed using a global function, which is factored into a product of local functions. In the practice of the security domain, using factor graphs is more flexible to define relations among the events and the user state compared to Bayesian Network and Markov Random Field approaches. Specifically, using factor graphs allows capturing sequential relation among events and enables integration of the external knowledge, e.g., expert knowledge or a user profile.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1535070","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: AttackTagger: Early Threat Detection for Scientific Cyberinfrastructure"

However, to meet their potential, these methods must be able to operate efficiently and scale on massively parallel computers executing millions of processes. Reaching the goal of millions of parallel processes requires new methods in which the computational workload is extremely well balanced and interprocessor communications overheads are minimized. Attaining such parallel performance is greatly complicated in realistic simulation workflows where the models and their discrete computer representation must evolve to ensure simulation reliability, or to account for changing input streams. To address the need to obtain workload balance with controlled communications, various algorithms and associated software, referred to as load balancing procedures, have been, and continue to be, developed. To be effective in the execution of simulation workflows in which the workload evolves, the load balancing procedures must be applied dynamically at multiple points in the simulation. Current load balancing techniques demonstrate two deficiencies when applied as dynamic load balancing procedures at very large numbers of compute cores (e.g., greater than 100,000 cores): They become a major fraction of the total parallel computation (in some cases never finishing within an allocation) and they do not maintain good load balance for simulation steps that must balance based on multiple criteria. Building on initial efforts to improve dynamic load balancing methods for adaptive unstructured mesh applications, the goal of the proposed research is to develop fast multicriteria dynamic load balancing methods that are capable of quickly producing well balanced computations, with well controlled communications, for a wide variety of applications. <br/><br/>An important characteristic of the dynamic load balancing procedures to be developed is generalizing the graph to account for multiple types of computational entities and interactions. The initial ideas for supporting multiple entity types came from consideration balancing finite element calculations that must consider multiple orders of mesh entities. These concepts will be refined and generalized to support multiple applications areas. An additional development will be fast hybrid dynamic load balancing methods that are combinations of ""geometric"", standard graph, and multicriteria graph methods in which the individual methods can be executed globally of at a more local level (such as at the node level). The dynamic load balancing method to be developed will be demonstrated on three applications in which the workload, and its distribution, is changing as the simulation proceeds. The applications will be adaptive mesh simulations, adaptive multiscale modeling, and massive scale free graphs. These applications will be carried out on available massively parallel computers where examples on >1 million cores will be demonstrated. A goal of the dynamic load balancing methods to be developed will be to attain scalability, and do so with controlled data movement such that the wall clock time and energy used is substantially less than that required for an equivalent accuracy non-adaptive calculation.<br/><br/>The software produced by this project will be made available as open source components. These developments coupled with efforts to support users in applying them in the development of new simulation tools will impact many research communities. Based on past and present efforts, the PIs fully expect that technologies developed in this project will also be integrated into future industrial software systems.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1533581","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Fast Dynamic Load Balancing Tools for Extreme Scale Systems"

These artifacts are used to evaluate new capabilities, algorithms, bottlenecks and trade-offs. Empirical study is behind the rapid pace of innovation in creating faster, lower energy and more reliable systems. This experimental approach lies at the core of development that fuels the nation's information economy. Given the critical importance of experimental study to developing new computer systems, several efforts are underway to curate experimental results through accountable research. One effort, Artifact Evaluation (AE), is being adopted to promote high quality artifacts and experimentation, including making public the experimental information necessary for reproducibility. However, the rapid adoption of AE is hampered by technical challenges that create a high barrier to the process: there is no consistent or simple environment, or mechanism, to package and reproduce experiments for AE. Authors rely on their own approaches, leading to much time consumed, as well as considerable variability in the ways materials are prepared and evaluated, unnecessarily obstructing the AE process. <br/><br/>To overcome the technical challenges with AE, and to more broadly encourage adoption of AE in computer science and engineering research, this project is developing a software infrastructure, Experiment and Artifact System for Evaluation (EASE), to create and run experiments specifically for AE, in which authors create, conduct and share artifacts and experiments. It allows for repeating, modifying, and extending experiments. Authors may also use EASE to package and upload their experiments for archival storage in a digital library. EASE is being developed and deployed for two use cases, namely compilers and real-time systems, keeping the project tractable to address specific needs. These communities have overlapping but also distinct requirements, helping to ensure EASE can also be extended and<br/>used by other computer systems research communities as well.<br/><br/>EASE will be release as open source software, based on an Experiment Management System (EMS) previously developed by the project investigator in a project call Open Curation for Computer Architecture Modeling (OCCAM), used to define and conduct experiments using computer architecture simulators. Using EMS as a starting point, EASE will provide AE support, by: 1) separating EMS from OCCAM's repository and hardware services, transforming the EMS infrastructure into EASE, a fully standalone, sustainable, and extensible platform for AE; 2) supporting record and replay (for repeating and reproducing results, as well as provenance) of artifacts and experiments as part of normal development and experimental practice to ease participation in AE by authors and evaluators; 3) supporting artifacts,workflows of artifacts and experiments that run directly on a machine, including specialized hardware and software, and run indirectly on a simulator or emulator; 4) allowing both user-level (artifacts and experiments as user processes) and system-level (artifacts and experiments involving kernel changes) innovations; 5) providing consistent/uniform access, whether locally or remotely, to artifacts and experiments; 6) simplifying viewing, running, modifying, and comparing experiments by innovators (i.e., during innovation development), artifact evaluators (during AE), and archive users (after publication); 7) enabling indexing (object locators and search tags) and packaging of artifacts and experiments for AE and for archival deployment (e.g., to ACM?s or IEEE?s Digital Library); and 8) refining, expanding, generalizing, and documenting EASE to ensure it is robust, maintainable and extensible, and that it can be used and sustained by different CSR communities (starting with real-time and compilers, given their different artifacts, data and methods).",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1535232","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: EASE: Improving Research Accountability through Artifact Evaluation"

Robinson, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at The University of Georgia. Professor Robinson and his research team are studying the unique chemistry of low-oxidation state main group chemical compounds. The goal of this research is to exploit the unique stabilizing effects of organic bases (a class of compounds known as carbenes) on highly reactive main group molecules. For example, important molecules like disilicon (Si2) are only detectable at extremely low temperatures. In contrast, diphosphorus (P2) is typically only detectable at very high temperatures. The Robinson team has developed a means to stabilize molecules like Si2 and P2 (and many others) at room temperature, thus allowing the convenient study of the structure and reactivity of these important molecules. In particular, these researchers recently reported the first stable molecular examples of silicon oxides. This project investigates the synthesis of more ambitious silicon oxides. This chemistry has the potential for us to learn more about the silicon-oxygen interface with possible implications to computer chips and semiconductors. These researchers will also attempt to synthesize molecules containing large silicon and arsenic clusters. This project lies at the heart of main group chemistry, a field of inorganic chemistry that has traditionally received more emphasis in Europe. Outreach activities involving women and traditionally under-represented groups is central to this research. The students engaged in this work are acquiring valuable synthetic and experimental skills that make them highly valuable in the employment market.<br/><br/>An ambitious program to explore challenging areas of low-oxidation main group chemistry is underway. The Robinson laboratory has developed N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC or L:) and N-heterocyclic dicarbene (NHDC) derivatives that are being used as a unique platform from which many unusual low-oxidation state main group species can be synthetically stabilized. Major synthetic goals in this work include: (a) carbene-based multisilylenes; (b) carbene-stabilized silicon atom and clusters; (c) carbene-stabilized heteronuclear diatomic molecules [i.e., silicon carbides, diatomic III-V (13-15) species, arsenic phosphide (AsP)]. The recent report by this laboratory of carbene-stabilization of elusive silicon oxides (Nature Chem. 2015, 7, 509) has encouraged these workers to develop the long-sought molecular chemistry of SOx. Consequently, the syntheses of a series of carbene-stabilized silicon oxides (such as SiO, SiO2, Si2O, Si2O2, and Si3O6, etc.) and silicon hydrides [Si3H2 and Si2H2 (parent disilyne)] are being pursued. These carbene-stabilized silicon oxides may be further utilized to develop the corresponding transition-metal-modified derivatives and transfer silicon oxide clusters into organic or organometallic substrates. In addition, carbene-stabilized bis-silylenes are explored as potential transfer agents for the disilyne unit. The transition metal chemistry of carbene-stabilized zero-oxidation-state main group species are being examined in the work. Research findings from the Robinson laboratory have repeatedly challenged traditional theories of structure and bonding in inorganic chemistry and some of this has begun to appear in chemistry textbooks. Students engaged in this work are acquiring valuable synthetic, crystallographic, and computational skills. The Robinson laboratory has a positive record of extending the chemistry enterprise to larger segments of the human resource as a number of women and African Americans have been trained in his laboratory.

In terms of scientific applications, this project also will investigate the conformation and properties of proteins with Intrinsically Disordered Regions, and the binding of DNA with a special class of transcription factors.<br/><br/>The single most important quantity for describing biomolecular and chemical systems in equilibrium is the free energy. However, calculating free energies is notoriously difficult and computationally expensive. This problem is particularly pressing for many biomolecular systems, which are characterized by complicated free energy landscapes that are hard to explore with regular molecular dynamics simulations. The PIs previously developed the Adaptively Biased Molecular Dynamics method (ABMD) with Multiple Walkers, and Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) extensions. ABMD is an umbrella sampling method with a time-dependent biasing potential for calculating free energy landscapes and conformational sampling. The software suite, along with Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) extensions, has been released to the public as part of the AMBER software package. This project will take this set of software tools to the next level by developing the capability to handle quaternion-based collective variables, the so-called Milestoning technique, and self-directed, interacting multiple walkers. Envisioned applications relate to proteins with Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDRs) and mechanisms of DNA binding by basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) domains in transcription factors.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1534941","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Enhanced Software Tools for Biomolecular Free Energy Calculations"

Errors in cellular signaling cause diseases such as cancer, autoimmunity, and diabetes. Accurate models of cellular signalling are thus necessary for rational drug design and other applications central to national health. This project focuses on inferring models from experimental data. Specifically, it is interested in models of protein signalling because proteins control and mediate the vast majority of biological processes in a living cell. The project follows of the approach of executable biology: models of cell signalling are computer programs, which allows executing the models on the computer and comparing the model behavior against the behavior of the living cell observed in the lab setting. Most importantly for this project, viewing models as programs will allow the team to harness the recent advances in automatic synthesis of computer programs for synthesis of models from experimental measurements of cells. <br/><br/>The goal of the project is to provide biologists with a tool that synthesizes a variety of executable models from varied types of experimental data. To facilitate synthesis of mechanistic models from experimental data, the project will develop a family of modeling languages that will capture complex behaviors of biological systems, such as time and concurrency. The languages will be instances of the more general Boolean-Networks language. The team will investigate how to adjust the modeling abstraction based on the nature of available experimental data; the abstractions will be instantiated as suitably chosen languages from their language family. The modeling framework will be built by leveraging techniques from programming languages and formal methods such as meta-programming and constraint solving.",,"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1535191","fuchsia_atom","SI2-SSE: Algorithms and Tools for Data-Driven Executable Biology"

These challenges are addressed by software systems that enable development of new software incrementally, modification of existing methods, or techniques for integrating pipelines of off-the-shelf components.

Tenure, promotion, and acclaim are achieved through influential research. There are few incentives for scientists to share data and software, and tenure and promotion decisions lack consideration of such activities; and to compound the problem, there are disincentives such as risking the loss of attribution. Some scientists distrust the public access model for software and data, and prefer to share data and software only by personal request, which assures attribution through personal contact and implicit social contract. There is also a lack of well-developed metrics with which to assess the impact and quality of scientific software and data. New practices and incentives are needed in the research community for software and data citation and attribution, so that data producers, software and tool developers, and data curators are credited for their contributions.<br/><br/>This workshop will facilitate a national, interdisciplinary exploration of new norms and practices for software and data citation and attribution, with the goal of informing the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) and Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2) NSF programs. Social and technical challenges facing current software development and data generation efforts will be identified and participants will explore viable methods and metrics to support software and data attribution in the scientific research community. This workshop will address registration of software and data, repositories for software and data, methods for tracking software and data usage, software and data annotation, collecting and curating metadata on software and data, ensuring appropriate attribution by software and data users, alternatives to traditional publication models for attribution, adaptation of commercial models for software and data attribution, proportioning attribution metrics to match degree of effort and role in software development and data generation, and establishing reward metrics for open science.
